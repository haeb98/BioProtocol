Seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) were sterilized in 5% (w/w) solution of NaOCl for 10 min then were washed twice in water. Seeds were placed in the cells of plastic grid that was mounted in a tray with water. Plants were grown in the dark in a thermostat at 27^°C for96 h. While any part of etiolated seedling can be used for the assay, we have used five zones (meristem, early elongation, elongation, late elongation, post-elongation) of primary roots (Figure 1). The recommended amount of plant material in each sample is 30-40 mg. One mm of maize root represents approximately one mg of fresh weight. Thus, root pieces of 10m m length from three or four seedlings or pieces of 1-mm length from 30-40 seedlings are enough for one replica.2. 30-40 mg of fresh plant material was homogenized with mortar and pestle on ice in 1 ml of 50 mM NaOAc buffer (p H6.0) with 3 m M of dithiothreitol to prevent the intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds formation and with 0.03%(W/W)N a N_3 to restrict bacterial contamination. Homogenate was transferred to microcentrifuge tube (1.5-2ml) ). Homogenates that were already prepared could be stored in a refrigerator (-20~^°C) while other samples are being done.3.  1 ml of suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000x g . Then 100ul of supernatant were separated for further estimation of protein content according to Bradford (1976) (step 9) and free arabinose content estimation (step 10). Supernatants could be stored in a refrigerator (-20~^°) . Steps 9-10 could be carried out later. The arabinose and protein contents do not change if samples are frozen.4.  Pellet was resuspended in the remaining 900~ul of buffer solution using Vortex. Plant material was not separated from supernatant because of the potential presence of wallassociated arabinofuranosidases that might be not extracted by the buffer solution. The suspension was divided into two equal parts ( 450~ul each) that were transferred to plastic tubes as control and trial variants of each sample.5. 50~ul of 10~m M 4NPA in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 was added to the trial tubes, and 50~ul of 0.03%(W/W)N a N_3 to the control tubes. Both of the variants were incubated in the thermoshaker  at  600  rpm  at 37 °Sigma for  2  h.  During  that  time  cell  wall arabinofuranosidases (either soluble or wall-associated) in trial tubes removed arabinose residues from 4NPA molecules producing yellow-colored NP. Enzymes in control tubes had no chromogenic substrate for reaction.6.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500~ul of 1 M Na2CO3 both to the control and to the trial tubes. The coloration of the solution has become more pronounced at that moment due to increased pH (11.5).7.  Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000× g. Optical densities of both trial and control supernatants were measured on a spectrophotometer at wavelength 405~n m . The control mean was subtracted from the trial mean. The result was used for the determination of the amount of liberated NP according to calibration.8.  Calibration measurements were done for NP solutions with concentrations in a range from 0.0025m M to 0.25mM (Figure 3). 500ul of 1 M N a_2C O_3 were added to 500ul of each NP solution, because it enhances the coloration.9.  Determination of protein content.a.  490 μl of water was added to 10~ul aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample. 500~ul of Bradford dye reagent was also added to each microcentrifuge tube and then mixed using vortex.b.   After 5 min each sample was read on a spectrophotometer at 595n m .10. Determination of free arabinose content.a. 90~ul of water was added to 10~ul aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample.b. 25~ul of obtained solution was directly injected to the column of HPAEC system without any pretreatment.c. 15m MN a O H (buffer A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (buffer B) were used as eluents. The column temperature was maintained at 30~^°C , and the elution rate was 1 ml/min. The gradient elution was performed as follows: 0-20 min- 100% A; 20-21 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio =90:10(%) ; 21-31 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio =70:30(%) ; 31-32 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio 0:100(%) ; 32-42 min- 100% B; 42-43 min-until the A/B ratio = : 100;0(%) . Column was equilibrated with eluent 100% A for 30m i n .d.  Arabinose content was determined by the area of the corresponding peak using the PeakNet software and the calibration for arabinose standard.11. Calibration for free arabinose was done using solutions with concentrations in a range 2-10 u9/ m I .()amount of nitrophenol (NP) matter in reaction media (1 m) , μmol/mlFigure 3. Calibration for different nitrophenol (NP) concentrations. Do not confuse the concentration and the amount of NP matter in reaction volume (see Table 1).# Notes1.  Experiments should be repeated three-four times for each sample.2.  One unit of arabinofuranosidase activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme that liberates one μmol of NP per minute. Differences of glycosyl-hydrolase activities between samples can be defined by using the units of enzymatic activity per mg of total proteins. Exact formula for arabinofuranosidase activity calculation is given in Figure 4.()Figure 4. Formula for calculation of arabinofuranosidases activity. The result will be obtained in milliUnits of activity per mg of protein content.3.  Described protocol with small modifications can be used for determination of any other glycosyl-hydrolase activity with synthetic aryl glycosides. Preliminary experiments may be useful for the optimization of incubation time and of plant material amount. However, the enzyme activity that is measured only by the rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis can remain the potential one and can be not realized in plant tissues (Fry, 2004). The aryl-glycoside hydrolysis coupled with the demonstration of final product presence is much more convincing. Thus, steps 10 and 11 were included in the protocol. If for any reason you cannot perform these stages, you may conclude only about the potential activity of arabinofuranosidases.# RecipesNote: The recipes that are given below let to produce the amount of solutions that is sufficient for calibration and four repeating of the experiments with five samples in each replica.1. 5% (w/w) solution of NaOCl Dissolve 25 of NaOCl in 475 ml of water2. 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Dissolve 0.03 of N a N_3 in 99.97ml of water3.  50 mM NaOAc buffer (p H6.0) with 3m M of dithiothreitol on 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Dissolve 0.205 g of NaOAc and 0.0231 g of DL-dithiothreitol in 40 mI of 0.03% (w/w) NaN3Adjust the pH to 6.0 by the adding of glacial acetic acid Adjust the volume to 50 ml by the adding of 0.03% (w/w) NaN34.  10 mM 4NPA Dissolve 0.0027 g of 4NPA in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Adjust the volume of solution to 1~ml by additional 0.03% (w/w) NaN35.  1 M N a_2C O_3 Dissolve 2.12 g of N a_2C O_3 in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Adjust the volume of solution to _20ml by additional 0.03% (w/w) NaN36.

Obtaining a cohort of aged pea aphids1.  Collect adult pea aphids in a petri dish from a stock cage (Note 2).2.  Use a moist paintbrush to transfer the aphids to a fresh cage containing several Vicia faba plants in pots.3.  Place the cage, containing the aphids and plants, in long day growth conditions 14 h light (22^°C) , 10h night (15^°C) .4.  After ^24h remove all the adult aphids, while the nymphs remain (Note 3).5.  Allow the nymphs to reach the adult stage (Note 4).B.  Setting up the experiment1.  Use plastic plant labels to label 7-week-old Arabidopsis with their genotype and the plant number (e.g. Col-0, plant 1). Use at least five plants per genotype per replicate.2.  Collect the cohort of aged pea aphids in a petri dish.3.  Use a moist paintbrush to transfer 5 of the aphids to a clip cage.4.  Gently clip the cage onto a fully developed leaf of the Arabidopsis plant.5.  Repeat the previous two steps until all the plants have one clip cage each.6.  Randomize the plants across the area that they are to be grown in (Note 5).7.  Place the plants in short day conditions 8 h light (18^°C) , 16h night (16^°C) .C.  Collecting the results1.  The day that the aphids are caged to the Arabidopsis plants is day 0.2.  Count and record the number of live adults in the clip cages on days 2 to 7.Table 1. Example data from one repeat of an experiment with Col-0 Arabidopsis, with readings taken on days 3 to 7()D.  Repetition1.  Repeat the whole experiment (steps 1-3) on at least 3 separate occasions.# E.  Analysing the results1.  Calculate the time point at which survival on wild type Arabidopsis is 50% (Note 6). If this occurs between two of the days (e.g. between day 3 and 4) then average the number of adults alive on these two days.2.  Use this time point to calculate the number of adults alive on each plant (Note 7).3.  Analyze by classical linear regression analysis using a Poisson distribution within a generalized linear model.# Notes1.  The cage should be large enough for the Vicia faba plants to grow, and allow sufficient light and ventilation while preventing the aphids from escaping. We use Perspex cages (47 cm high ×54 cm deep x 24 cm wide) with a fine mesh covering attached by magnetic strips at one end to serve as a door.2.  5 to 10 pea aphids per Arabidopsis plant in the experiment should be sufficient, as approximately one nymph is born per adult in 24h at 22^°C . The aphids reproduce slower at lower temperatures and therefore more adults are needed to produce the same number of nymphs.3.  Make sure to count the number of adults added to the cage, and remove the same number of adults at this stage.4.  In the conditions stated, pea aphids should reach the adult stage by 8 or 9 days, having undergone four moults. Only adult aphids reproduce. It is recommended to use aphids 10 to 14 days old.5.  For example, if you are placing the experimental plants in 3 trays for the experiment then randomly assign each plant a number of 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to trays 1, 2 and 3. This can be done using the RANDBETWEEN function in Microsoft® Excel.6.  Average the number of adult pea aphids alive on each day across all your repeats of the wild type Arabidopsis. Then plot this data against the experiment day number on a line graph. See Reference 1 (Prince et al., 2014) Figure 6B for an example.7.  For example, the data in Table 1 is part of a larger data set where 50% survival is between day 3 and 4. Therefore, the data would be calculated as: Plant 1=4 , Plant  z= 3.5, Plant 3=3.5 , Plant 4=3 , Plant 5=4 .# AcknowledgementsWe thank Andrew Davis for the photograph of the clip cage.

Rice leaves placed on filter paper and inoculated with agar blocks overgrown with R. solani. E. Example of necrotic lesions developing on an inoculated leaf.1.  Cultivate R. solani on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22^°C in the dark. For maintenance, transfer agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks. For inoculation, use a R. solani culture seven days after sub-cultivation (Figure 1A).2.  Grow rice plants for approx. 4 weeks until full expansion of the fourth leaf (Figures 1B and 1C).3.  Prepare square Petri dishes (12 x 12 cm) lined with filter paper. Moisten the filter paper with distilled water.4.  Cut off the upper 10 cm of the fourth leaves of different rice plants and immediately place them on the moist filter paper.5.  Cut small agar blocks (ca. 0.5×0.5cm ) overgrown with fungal mycelium from a 7-day old R. solani culture. For inoculation, place one agar block in the middle of each rice leaf (Figure 1D).6.  Incubate the Petri dishes with the inoculated leaves in the plant chamber. Avoid desiccation of the leaves by daily moistening the filter paper with distilled water (Note 1).7.  Observe the development of necrotic lesions (Figure 1E) within four days after inoculation.B.  Inoculation protocol for Pythium graminicola()Figure 2. Images of pmbP graminicola inoculation. A.

Cultivate P. graminicola on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22~^°C in the dark. For maintenance, transfer agar blocks (ca. 0.5×0.5cm ) overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks. For inoculation, use P. graminicola cultures seven days after subcultivation (Figure 2A).2.  Prepare square Petri dishes ( 12×12c m) with 1.5% agar in Gamborg B5 medium.3.  Fill rice seeds in a 50ml tube and add 4% sodium hypochlorite for surface-sterilization, shake for 10m i n . Subsequently, wash three times with sterile distilled water.4.  Place 3-6 seeds in a line on one Gamborg B5 agar-plate.5.  Seal the plates with 3M micropore tape and protect root growth from light by covering with aluminum foil.6.  Incubate the plates upright in a plant growth chamber (conditions see above) until roots have grown to a length of ca. 1 cm (after approx. 5 days).7.  For inoculation, cut small agar blocks (ca. 0.5×0.5c m ) from the marginal zone of a 7 days old P. graminicola culture. Place one agar block between the roots of adjacent plants (Figure 2B). Incubate the plates in a growth chamber as before.8.  Monitor the disease development for 1 to 2 weeks after inoculation.C.  Inoculation protocol for Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh)()Figure 3. Images of Bgh inoculation. A. Two-week old rice plants with second leaves fixed on a tray. B. Barley plants heavily infected with Bgh (with white powdery mildew pustules on primary leaves). C. Example for a settling tower that was used for Bgh inoculation (plants were fixed on a tray which was placed at the bottom of the tower). At the top an opening is visible through which infected barley plants can be introduced into the tower.1.  As the fungus is an obligate biotroph, maintainance has to be done on barley plants in a growth cabinet separated from the test plants. Weekly transfer of Bgh onto fresh, one-week old plants is done by shaking off conidiospores from heavily infected barley plants (Figure 3B).2.  Grow rice plants in soil for approx. 2 weeks until full expansion of the second leaf. Use squared plant pots in order to facilitate a stable fixation on the inoculation trays (see step C4).3.  One day before inoculation, remove old Bgh conidiospores from barley plants by shaking (Note 2).4.  For the inoculation of rice, place the plant pots laterally on a tray and fix the second leaf of each plant, adaxial surface up, on the tray by placing 2-3mm stripes of removable adhesive labels at the tip and the base of each leaf(Note 3, Figure 3A).5.  Place a Thoma cell counting chamber (without cover glass) beside or between the fixed leaves to monitor the inoculation density.6.  Cover the trays with a settling tower (Figure 3C).7.  For inoculation, gently transfer leaves or whole plant pots of Bgh-infected barley plants to the opening of the settling tower and release freshly emerged conidiospores into the tower by shaking. Subsequently, wave with a small tray in the air space of the settling tower to cause a turbulent flow and evenly dispense the conidia.8.  Let the conidiospores settle for 30-60 min.9.  Apply a cover glass to the Thoma counting cell and determine the spore density by microscopy. Therefore count the conidiospores in the large central square of each of the two chambers (1 m m^2 in a standard Thoma chamber) and take the average. Under our laboratory conditions, 1-5 spores m m^-2 may result in distinct, macroscopically observable mildew pustules, while approx.15-20 spores m m^-2 are recommended for microscopic evaluation. If spore density is too low, return to step C5.10. Gently remove the adhesive labels from the rice leaves, raise the pots and transfer them to the plant growth chamber.11. On host plants, first powdery mildew pustules (as shown in Figure 3B) can be observed within the first week after inoculation. Since rice is a nonhost plant for Bgh, evaluation of the infection process has to be done by microscopy.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Inoculation Protocol for Rhizoctonia solani\n## Cultivation of R. solani\nCultivate R. solani on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22°C in the dark.\nFor maintenance, transfer agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks.\nFor inoculation, use a R. solani culture seven days after sub-cultivation.\n## Preparation of Rice Plants\nGrow rice plants for approximately 4 weeks until full expansion of the fourth leaf.\nCut off the upper 10 cm of the fourth leaves of different rice plants and immediately place them on moist filter paper.\n## Inoculation\nCut small agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium from a 7-day old R. solani culture.\nPlace one agar block in the middle of each rice leaf.\n## Incubation and Observation\nIncubate the Petri dishes with the inoculated leaves in the plant chamber.\nAvoid desiccation of the leaves by daily moistening the filter paper with distilled water.\nObserve the development of necrotic lesions within four days after inoculation.\n## Inoculation Protocol for Pythium graminicola\n## Cultivation of P. graminicola\nCultivate P. graminicola on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22°C in the dark.\nFor maintenance, transfer agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks.\nFor inoculation, use P. graminicola cultures seven days after subcultivation.\n## Preparation of Rice Seeds\nFill rice seeds in a 50ml tube and add 4% sodium hypochlorite for surface-sterilization.\nWash three times with sterile distilled water.\nPlace 3-6 seeds in a line on one Gamborg B5 agar-plate.\n## Inoculation\nCut small agar blocks from the marginal zone of a 7-day old P. graminicola culture.\nPlace one agar block between the roots of adjacent plants.\n## Incubation and Observation\nIncubate the plates in a growth chamber.\nMonitor the disease development for 1 to 2 weeks after inoculation.\n## Inoculation Protocol for Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh)\n## Maintenance of Bgh\nMaintain Bgh on barley plants in a growth cabinet separated from the test plants.\nWeekly transfer of Bgh onto fresh, one-week old plants is done by shaking off conidiospores from heavily infected barley plants.\n## Preparation of Rice Plants\nGrow rice plants in soil for approximately 2 weeks until full expansion of the second leaf.\nUse squared plant pots to facilitate a stable fixation on the inoculation trays.\n## Inoculation\nRemove old Bgh conidiospores from barley plants by shaking.\nFix the second leaf of each plant, adaxial surface up, on the tray by placing 2-3mm stripes of removable adhesive labels at the tip and the base of each leaf.\nCover the trays with a settling tower.\nGently transfer leaves or whole plant pots of Bgh-infected barley plants to the opening of the settling tower and release freshly emerged conidiospores into the tower by shaking.\n## Incubation and Observation\nLet the conidiospores settle for 30-60 min.\nApply a cover glass to the Thoma counting cell and determine the spore density by microscopy.\nGently remove the adhesive labels from the rice leaves, raise the pots and transfer them to the plant growth chamber.\nOn host plants, first powdery mildew pustules can be observed within the first week after inoculation.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-1354","Bio-protocol-2773","Protocol.io-8246","Bio-protocol-1686","Bio-protocol-1480","Protocol.io-8857","Bio-protocol-1166","Bio-protocol-1582","Bio-protocol-3920","Protocol.io-7077"]}

The germ part (see Figure 4) is removed with a razor blade, perpendicular to the crease zone (longitudinal axis) of the grain, and is discarded.()Figure 4. Wheat grain and position of razor blade during wheat germ removal. Both sides of grain are presented to easily localize the germ, brush and crease regions.b.  The grain is then placed in a Petri dish on top of Whatman filter paper moistened with d H_2O , and left at +4~^°C for ^24h .Note: Whole rehydration procedure is skipped for young grains, which are naturally hydrated.2.  Preparing 70um -thin cross sections of wheat grains.a.  This step is done by using a Vibratome instrument according to instruction provided in the Instruction manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2009). The grain is fixed with some glue onto the magnetic plate of the Vibratome. Orientation of the grain should be such that the longitudinal axis of the grain is placed perpendicular to the magnetic plate. Settings of the Vibratome instrument are as follows: frequency: 60; amplitude: 1.2; speed: 12.b.  A series of 400~um -thick slices are cut and discarded, until the surface of the grain becomes flat and parallel to the razor blade of the Vibratome instrument.c.  Thin  sections  (approximately 70 mu m) )  are  then  cut  consecutively  and  placed immediately into Eppendorf tubes filled with 70% ethanol. They are stored at 4~^°C until further processing.3.  Removing starch.a.  The wheat cross section is grabbed using a paint brush and transferred into a clean Eppendorf tube, filled with 0.5 ml of 1m g/m l α-Amylase solution. This is allowed to incubate at 40~^°C for ^24h on a Thermo-shaker.b.  Rinse thoroughly by transferring the wheat cross section into a clean Eppendorf tube filled with 1 ml of d H_2O . Repeat this step twice. Wash the brush in water after each sample transfer. Note: This step is intended to avoid any hydrolysis of starch by endogenous enzyme activity, which would produce some glucans of similar masses as those expected from the hydrolysis of cell walls BG (additionally, when MALDI mass spectrometry is used for further analysis of the tissue, starch generates a strong suppressive effect on the signal).4.  Placing the cross-section onto an ITO glass plate (see Note 5).a.  Prepare the ITO glass plate that will receive the cross section: i.  Place a small piece of adhesive carbon tape at the location where the cross section will be deposited on the ITO glass plate; ii.  With a Pasteur pipette, put a droplet of water on the tape.b.  Then, with a paint brush, grab the cross section from the Eppendorf tube. Lean the cross section at the surface of the water droplet, allowing it to detach from the paint brush. Proceed very gently, so to avoid any disruption or any distortion of the cross section (Figure 5).()# Figure 5. Positioning of grain section during wheat section grabbing a) and deposition onto the ITO plate (b, c)Gently remove excess water with a Kimwipes tissue. Allow sample to dry at RT (approximately 30m i n ) (see Figure 6).()Figure 6. Appearance of the ITO plate with mounted wheat sections on itc.  Mount the ITO glass plate onto the MTP Slide Adapter II (Bruker) according to the manufacturer instructions available in Bruker, (2012).5.  Application of the hydrolytic enzyme on the cross section. a.  This step uses a homemade robot (see Figure 1 and Note 2). The aim is to deliver a controlled volume of enzyme onto the tissue by using an airbrush device, so that fine droplets of enzyme are applied on the tissue, thereby limiting the diffusion of the oligosaccharides released upon digestion over the tissue. b.  Spraying of the enzyme is achieved by connecting the electrospray probe mounted on the robotic arm to a syringe pump delivering the enzymatic solution at a constant flow rate of 600ul/h . i.  Spraying is assisted pneumatically with nitrogen (1.5×10^5P a) . ii.  The distance between the needle tip of the Electrospray probe and the ITO plate is 3 cm (Z-axis). iii.  A X, Y deposition pattern following a “brush rectangle” is used (Figure 7). iv.  The movement speed of the robot head was set at 5mm/s . v.  Other parameters X and Y axis start and end coordinates, volume of the enzyme placed into the syringe, number of spraying cycles) are set to ensure that the robot consistently deposits 0.3~ul of enzyme ( 4.6 cup/ml endo-1,4-  -xylanase or 2 U/ml lichenase) per m m^2 of sprayed area (corresponding to 0.0014 cup xylanase and 0.0006 U lichenase per m m^2 tissue). Enzymes can be applied individually, consecutively or in mixture. Note: Endo-1,4-  -xylanase is used for _A X hydrolysis, while lichenase is used for mixed-linkage BG hydrolysis.()\"brush rectangle\" patternFigure 7. “Brush rectangle” pattern used for enzyme deposition. X and Y “start” and “end” positions are determined from the coordinates of the surface which must be covered by the enzyme.# 6.  Incubation.a.  The wheat cross sections covered by the enzyme in the previous step are allowed to incubate at 40~^°C for 4h .b.  To prevent liquid from evaporating too fast and the enzyme becomes inactive, a wet atmosphere is maintained by placing the ITO plate into a sealed incubation chamber filled with 150ml saturated K_2S O_4 and pre-incubated at 40~^°C .c.  The ITO plate is placed on top of a 50~ml glass beaker weighted with stones and installed into the glass incubator (Figure 2).d.  After incubation, remove the tissues from the incubation chamber and let dry in the open air (approximately 15m i n ).7.  Additional step for MALDI MS measurement of the hydrolyzed cross sections: Deposition of the DMA-DHB MALDI matrix.a.  This step is performed with an automatic vibration vaporization system from Bruker (ImagePrep, see Figure 3) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonik, 2007).b.  The settings are as follows (see Note 6): 1^st Phase: 15 cycles: 12% spray power; 20% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 15 sec incubation time; 30 sec dry time. 2nd Phase: 40 cycles: 20% spray power; 25% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 30 sec incubation time; 60 sec dry time.

Procedure for qualitative estimation of superoxide ions (0^2) using NBT assay in rice()1.  Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm) (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Pieces of rice seedlings approximately 1 cm in length2.  Dip the cut pieces immediately into 6 mM NBT solution (2ml) prepared in sodium citrate (pH6.0) in a Petri dish (35m m) ) using a tweezer.3.  Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60 KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light. Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.4.  After incubation, dip the samples in absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath (100^°C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in 2 h) (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Pieces of rice seedlings approximately 1 cm in length after removal of chlorophyll5.  Cool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.6.  Capture the images using a stereomicroscope by keeping the samples on a slide.7.  Appearance of dark blue colour indicates the presence of O^2 (Figure 3).B.  DAB assay (For detection of H_2O_2 )1.  Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).2.  Dip the cut pieces immediately into DAB solution (1 m/ml) prepared in double distilled water (2 ml) (p H=3.8) in a Petri dish (35m m) using tweezers.3.  Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60K P a pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light. Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.4.  After incubation, dip the samples in the absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath ^100^°C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in ^zh ).5.  Cool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.6.  Capture the images using a stereo microscope by keeping the samples on a slide.7.  Appearance of brown coloured product indicates the presence of H_2O_2 (Figure 4).C.  H2DCFDA assay (For detection of H_2O_2 )1.  Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).2.  Dip the cut pieces immediately into 10~uM H2DCFDA solution in a Petri dish (35~m m) ) using tweezers.3.  Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 5 min at 60K P a pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip the samples for 2 h at room temperature.4.  After incubation, wash the samples three times properly with autoclaved double distilled water.5.  Dip the samples in 20% glycerol after washing.6.  For confocal analysis, put the sample on a slide and fix a thin cover slip over it using nail enamel or glue.7.  Observe the samples under a confocal microscope using laser beam of wavelength of excitation 488n m .8.  Green fluorescence indicates the presence of H_2O_2 and red represents the autofluorescence of chlorophyll.D.  Quantification of aqueous H_2O_2 content1.  Homogenize 0.5g fresh seedlings in activated charcoal (0.1 g) prepared in 5m l of 5% trichloroacetic acid using a pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen.2.  Filter the homogenate using a Whatman filter (No.1) and collect the filtrate in _2 m amber Eppendorf tubes ( H_2O_2 is light sensitive).3.  Centrifuge the filtrate at 5,000× g for 10 min in the tubes. Note: Either centrifuge the filtrate from one sample in two 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and then pool the supernatant together or use a 5 ml amber Eppendorf tube.4.  Collect 0.2ml of the supernatant in a glass tube and add 1 ml FOX reagent to it.5.  Mix the reaction mix properly and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.6.  Estimate the content of aqueous H_2O_2 by recording the absorbance at 560n m using a disposable plastic cuvette and calculate the concentration using a standard curve.7.  The concentration is calculated using the beer-lambert law, i.e.A=E× b× cWhere,A= absorbance, t is the wavelength-dependent molar absorptivity coefficient,b= path length,c= concentration.8.  For the standard curve preparation, take 0.2 ml of different concentrations of H_2O_2 , add 1 ml ofFOX reagent and proceed as similar to the samples (see Recipe 5).Note: The absorbance should be taken at 560 nm wavelength.\n\n# Outline\n\n## NBT Assay for Detection of O2-\nCut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).\nDip the cut pieces immediately into 6 mM NBT solution (2ml) prepared in sodium citrate (pH6.0) in a Petri dish (35mm) using a tweezer.\n## Infiltration and Incubation\nVacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60 KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light.\nIf vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.\n## Chlorophyll Removal\nDip the samples in absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath (100°C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in 2 h).\nCool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.\nCapture the images using a stereomicroscope by keeping the samples on a slide.\nAppearance of dark blue colour indicates the presence of O2-.\n## DAB Assay for Detection of H2O2\nCut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).\nDip the cut pieces immediately into DAB solution (1 mg/ml) prepared in double distilled water (2 ml) (pH=3.8) in a Petri dish (35mm) using tweezers.\n## Infiltration and Incubation\nVacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light.\nIf vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.\n## Chlorophyll Removal\nDip the samples in absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath (100°C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in 2 h).\nCool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.\nCapture the images using a stereo microscope by keeping the samples on a slide.\nAppearance of brown coloured product indicates the presence of H2O2.\n## H2DCFDA Assay for Detection of H2O2\nCut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).\nDip the cut pieces immediately into 10~uM H2DCFDA solution in a Petri dish (35~mm) using tweezers.\n## Infiltration and Incubation\nVacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 5 min at 60KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark.\nIf vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip the samples for 2 h at room temperature.\n## Washing and Glycerol Treatment\nWash the samples three times properly with autoclaved double distilled water.\nDip the samples in 20% glycerol after washing.\n## Confocal Analysis\nPut the sample on a slide and fix a thin cover slip over it using nail enamel or glue.\nObserve the samples under a confocal microscope using laser beam of wavelength of excitation 488nm.\nGreen fluorescence indicates the presence of H2O2 and red represents the autofluorescence of chlorophyll.\n## Quantification of Aqueous H2O2 Content\nHomogenize 0.5g fresh seedlings in activated charcoal (0.1 g) prepared in 5ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid using a pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen.\nFilter the homogenate using a Whatman filter (No.1) and collect the filtrate in 2ml amber Eppendorf tubes (H2O2 is light sensitive).\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 5,000×g for 10 min in the tubes.\n## FOX Reagent Assay\nCollect 0.2ml of the supernatant in a glass tube and add 1 ml FOX reagent to it.\nMix the reaction mix properly and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nEstimate the content of aqueous H2O2 by recording the absorbance at 560nm using a disposable plastic cuvette and calculate the concentration using a standard curve.\n## Standard Curve Preparation\nTake 0.2 ml of different concentrations of H2O2, add 1 ml of FOX reagent and proceed as similar to the samples.\nCalculate the concentration using the beer-lambert law, i.e. A=E×b×c","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-154","Bio-protocol-1217","Protocol.io-6478","Bio-protocol-1625","Bio-protocol-2442","Protocol.io-6481","Bio-protocol-2727","Bio-protocol-3034","Protocol.io-6479","Protocol.io-6728"]}

Culture adherent HCT116 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (glucose 4.5 /L) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics ( 100 cup/ ml penicillin and 100 u/m l streptomycin) at 37~^°C in a humidified 5% C O_2/95% air atmosphere. Culture suspended DT40 cells at a density of 1×10^5-1×10^6 cells per ml in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum and antibiotics ( 100 cup/ ml penicillin and 100 u g/m l streptomycin) at 39.5^°C in a humidified 5% ,C O_2/95% air atmosphere.2.  Transfect 8.0×10^5H C T116 cells ( 40-60% confluent in 6-well plate) using 1 u of plasmid DNA, 300~ul of Opti-mem and 10~ul of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for one well according to the manufacturers’ instructions (After the transfection medium is not replaced). To obtain 1.05×10^7cells transfected cells, electroporate three times 3.5×10^6 DT40 cells with 8~u plasmid DNA with two pulses at 1,500~forall for 15 msec according to the manufacturer’s instructions.3.  Collect approximately 2.0×10^6 HCT116 cells or 4.0×10^6 DT40 cells for further analysis 24~h (HCT116 cell) or 16~h (DT40 cells) after transfection. For this the cells are washed with 1~ml PBS three times, scraped off and centrifuged at 3,000xg for 2 min at 4~^°C . Discard the supernatants of samples and suspend cell pellets in 400~ul (for HCT116 cells) or 250~ul (for DT40 cells) buffer A and incubate for 20 min on ice to lyse the cells. We used smaller amount of buffer A for DT40 cells, because DT40 cells do not contain as much proteins as HCT116 cells. After this step, samples from HCT116 cells and DT40 cells are treated in the same manner. Note: Important, the buffer A must NOT contain protease inhibitor cocktail as it would inhibit trypsin activity.4.  Clarify cell lysates by centrifugation at 17,800xg for 10 min at 4~^°C and transfer the supernatants to new tubes. Pellets are discarded.5.  To allow trypsin processing of misfolded proteins, incubate 50~ul aliquots (in case of protein concentrations of 1m g/m l) of the cleared lysates with 1~ul trypsin solution (Test different concentrations from 1 u/ml to 100 u/m l) for 15 min at 4^°C . To stop the trypsin reaction, mix samples with 40-50ul of buffer B supplemented with 10× protease inhibitor cocktail (We usually use high inhibitor concentrations: 5× final) and incubate at 100~^°C for 5 min. Important, every 3 min four samples could be handled for equal incubation time with trypsin.6.  Separate 10ul of the samples (approximately 5ug ) by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using PVDF membrane and probing with an antibody against the protein of interest. Percentage of SDS-PAGE depends on the molecular weight of the protein of interest. Band intensities can be analyzed and compared to each other by ImageJ or similar programs (Figure 1).()AhATF6α(C)-myctConcentration of trypsin (μg/ml)Figure 1. Severely misfolded mutants were more sensitive to trypsin. A. Chicken EDEM1/2/3 triple KO cells (gEDEM TKO) were described previously (Ninagawa et al., 2015). The indicated myc-tagged hATF6α(C) variants were transiently express in gEDEM-TKO cells and subjected to trypsin sensitivity assay. After the indicated time points the trypsin reaction was stopped and samples analyzed by a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the myc-tag. The data shown represents a single representative experiment out of three repeats. Less folded proteins are more sensitive to trypsin, so the hATF6α(C)-myct mutants, Δ111-119, 182-194 mutant and Δ219-270 mutant were cleaved by lower trypsin concentrations. B. Quantification of band intensities shown in (A) by ImageJ and calculation of the percentage of remaining protein. C. Equal loading of cell lysates shown by immunoblotting of the lysates and probing with an antibody against  -actin.# Notes1.  Incubation time with trypsin and concentration of trypsin should be optimized for proteins of interests.2.  The lot and freshness of trypsin can affect the result and can change the outcome between independent experiments (We use trypsin stored at 4~^°C_,^ . Anyway, you can compare the tightness of the folding among proteins of interests.3.  Dilute trypsin in PBS to obtain the expected concentration.4.  We used gEDEM TKO cells. This method is applicable for a wide variety of cells lines and recombinant proteins.5.  This method can be applied to recombinant proteins. In this case, you might reduce concentration of trypsin.6.  CPY and CPY* (Izawa et al., 2012), and GFP and GFP variants (Xu et al., 2013) were other examples used in this assay. We can provide plasmids to express hATF6α(C)-myct 1-302 and Δ280-298 for positive controls (Folded), and Δ111-119, 182-194 and Δ219-270 for negative controls (Less folded).# Recipes1.

Cells can either be stably or transiently expressing receptor of interest. 2.  All incubations are in a humidified environment at 37 ^°C_i , 5% C O_2 unless otherwise indicated.# A.  Cell preparationSeed cells in suitable nutrient media (e.g., DMEM, 10% FBS, no antibiotics) into a sterile 96- well plate and incubate in a humidified environment at 37~^°C , 5% C O_2 to be 90% confluent the following day (24h) .Note: Optimization for cell number depending on the cell line used will be necessary (we suggest a starting range of 10,000-50,000 cells/well). Recommended density for CHO FlpIN cells is 30,000 cells/well.# B.  Stimulation1.  The day following seeding, aspirate nutrient media and replace with 90~ul pre-warmed Stimulation buffer.2.  Incubate in a humidified environment at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 30m i n . Note: Do not leave in cells in Stimulation buffer for longer than 2 h prior to stimulation.3.  Prepare serial dilutions of ligands at 10x final concentration in Stimulation buffer, enough for 10ul/u ell , to be performed in duplicate (minimum). Note: Concentration range to use will depend on ligand affinity for receptor. For initial tests, select a top concentration 100x Kd of ligand, a buffer only control, and several concentrations between these. The range can then be refined in subsequent experiments.4.  Prepare 10× appropriate concentration of forskolin in Stimulation buffer. Note: This is the internal control for the experiment – forskolin is an activator of adenylate cyclase, enhancing the formation of cAMP. Recommended final concentration of forskolin in a CHO FlpIN cell line is 100 μM.5.  Following 30 min incubation in stimulation buffer, add 10~ul of 10x prepared ligands tocells, for a total volume of 100ul , 1x final concentration. 6.  Incubate cells with ligand in a humidified environment at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 30 min. Note: Optimization for assay time will be necessary. Recommended initial stimulation is 30 min. 7.  After 30 min, rapidly remove ligand containing media from cells. Note: Depending on the cell type, this may involve flicking or gentle aspiration. 8.  Add 50 μl ice cold 100% ethanol to cells. 9.  Allow ethanol to evaporate at room temperature (RT) or in a 37^°C oven. Note: Ensure the ethanol is completely evaporated before proceeding to the next step. 10. Add 75 μl Lysis buffer. Note: Optimization for lysis volume will be necessary, and depends on the cell type, expression level of the receptor and efficiency of coupling to the cAMP pathway. Recommended starting lysis volume in a CHO FlpIN cell line is 75mu l. 11. Incubate lysates at RT for 5-10 min on an orbital shaker.# C.  Detection1.  In reduced lighting conditions, prepare detection reagents (Acceptor and Donor buffers).2.  Transfer 10ul of cell lysate to a 384-well OptiPlate.3.  Prepare cAMP standard curve in Lysis buffer, enough for 10 μl/well to be performed in duplicate (minimum).4.  Transfer 10ul cAMP standard curve to a 384-well OptiPlate.5. Briefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.6.  In reduced lighting conditions, add 5~ul Acceptor buffer to every well (samples and standard curve).7.  In reduced lighting conditions, add 15~ul Donor buffer to every well (samples and standard curve) (following preincubation for 30m i n ).8.  Seal the plate with TopSeal and wrap in foil. Note: Small volumes are subject to evaporation, TopSeal is essential.9.  Briefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.10. Incubate overnight at RT (8-12 h) in reduced lighting conditions.11. Briefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.12. Analyse luminescence on a Fusion-α or Envision plate reader using standard α-screen settings.# D.  Data analysis1.  Extrapolate data from the cAMP standard curve. Ideally, data should lie on the linear section of the cAMP standard curve.a.  If data falls off the bottom end of the curve (i.e., high concentration of cAMP), dilute lysates further with Lysis buffer and repeat detection component of protocol.b.  If data falls off the top end of the curve (i.e., low concentration of cAMP), assay should be performed again and cells lysed with a lower volume of Lysis buffer.2.  Normalize data to forskolin control.# Recipes1.  Stimulation buffer (pH 7.4, incubate at 37^°C prior to use) Phenol free DMEM 0.1% w/v BSA* 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)** * BSA is not essential, but is recommended for ‘sticky’ ligands, i.e., peptides. ** IBMX is a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor. IBMX powder should be made up as a 500mM stock in 100% DMSO. It may precipitate out of solution if DMEM is too cold, so gently heat and stir DMEM when adding IBMX.2.

Donor buffer (prepare in Stimulation buffer)*** 0.3% Donor Beads (10cup/u1) (mix gently by pipetting before use) 0.025% biotinylated cAMP (133U/ul) *** Donor buffer MUST be preincubated at RT for 30 min prior to use.5.  cAMP standard curve Prepare cAMP standard dilution series in Lysis buffer at 3x concentration to take into account dilution in detection plate ( 10~ul cAMP standard, 5 μl Acceptor buffer and 15~ul Donor buffer, final volume 30~ul ). Recommended concentration range for cAMP standard (final) is 10uM-1rhoM in half log units. Note: Lysates may be stored at -20~^°C and cAMP accumulation can be detected at a later time, but no longer than _2 weeks following stimulation.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Notes\nCells can either be stably or transiently expressing receptor of interest.\nAll incubations are in a humidified environment at 37°C, 5% CO2 unless otherwise indicated.\n## Cell Preparation\nSeed cells in suitable nutrient media (e.g., DMEM, 10% FBS, no antibiotics) into a sterile 96-well plate and incubate in a humidified environment at 37°C, 5% CO2 to be 90% confluent the following day (24h).\nOptimization for cell number depending on the cell line used will be necessary (we suggest a starting range of 10,000-50,000 cells/well).\nRecommended density for CHO FlpIN cells is 30,000 cells/well.\n## Stimulation\nAspirate nutrient media and replace with 90µl pre-warmed Stimulation buffer.\nIncubate in a humidified environment at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 minutes.\n## Ligand Preparation\nPrepare serial dilutions of ligands at 10x final concentration in Stimulation buffer, enough for 10µl/well, to be performed in duplicate (minimum).\nConcentration range to use will depend on ligand affinity for receptor.\n## Forskolin Preparation\nPrepare 10× appropriate concentration of forskolin in Stimulation buffer.\nRecommended final concentration of forskolin in a CHO FlpIN cell line is 100 µM.\nAdd 10µl of 10x prepared ligands to cells, for a total volume of 100µl, 1x final concentration.\nIncubate cells with ligand in a humidified environment at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 minutes.\nRapidly remove ligand containing media from cells.\nAdd 50 µl ice cold 100% ethanol to cells.\nAllow ethanol to evaporate at room temperature (RT) or in a 37°C oven.\nAdd 75 µl Lysis buffer.\nIncubate lysates at RT for 5-10 minutes on an orbital shaker.\n## Detection\nPrepare detection reagents (Acceptor and Donor buffers) in reduced lighting conditions.\nTransfer 10µl of cell lysate to a 384-well OptiPlate.\n## cAMP Standard Curve Preparation\nPrepare cAMP standard dilution series in Lysis buffer at 3x concentration.\nRecommended concentration range for cAMP standard (final) is 10µM-1nM in half log units.\nTransfer 10µl cAMP standard curve to a 384-well OptiPlate.\nBriefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.\nAdd 5µl Acceptor buffer to every well (samples and standard curve) in reduced lighting conditions.\nAdd 15µl Donor buffer to every well (samples and standard curve) in reduced lighting conditions.\nSeal the plate with TopSeal and wrap in foil.\nBriefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.\nIncubate overnight at RT (8-12 hours) in reduced lighting conditions.\nBriefly centrifuge to draw contents to the bottom of the wells.\nAnalyze luminescence on a Fusion-α or Envision plate reader using standard α-screen settings.\n## Data Analysis\nExtrapolate data from the cAMP standard curve.\nNormalize data to forskolin control.\n## Data Adjustment\nIf data falls off the bottom end of the curve, dilute lysates further with Lysis buffer and repeat detection component of protocol.\nIf data falls off the top end of the curve, assay should be performed again and cells lysed with a lower volume of Lysis buffer.\n## Recipes\n## Stimulation Buffer\nPhenol free DMEM\n0.1% w/v BSA\n1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)\n## Lysis Buffer\nMilli-Q H2O\n0.3% Tween 20\n5 mM HEPES\n0.1% w/v BSA\n## Acceptor Buffer\n1% Acceptor beads (10cup/µl)\n## Donor Buffer\n0.3% Donor Beads (10cup/µl)\n0.025% biotinylated cAMP (133U/µl)","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-46","Bio-protocol-159","Protocol.io-6621","Bio-protocol-250","Bio-protocol-777","Protocol.io-533","Bio-protocol-805","Protocol.io-1157","Bio-protocol-1487","Protocol.io-997"]}

Place one round coverslip per well in 24-well plate and add around 0.5:ml:70% ethanol for 1 min to sterilize the coverslip. Aspirate ethanol and let it dry for 5-10 m i n . Tissue cultured cells were plated on 24-well plate one day before experiment to let them attach to coverslips. (For cells to be plated on the coverslips, it depends on the time of drug treatment for your experiment so that the final cell confluency will be optimal for observation (80-90% )2.  On the day of experiment, treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired time.3.  Fix the cell by replace with 0.5ml cold 100% methanol (prestored in -20 ^°C_. ) and fix for 5 min. Since the cold methonal is prestored in -20~^°C and the fixation time is short, this step can be performed at RT on the bench. Cells can also be fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20-30 min followed by permeabilization with TBS-Tx for 20 min.4.  Wash coverslips with 0.5m PBS once and replace with 0.5m AbDil-Tx to block. The block step can range from room temperature 30 min to 4~^°C overnight. For example, people can use RT 30m i n , 1 h, 2 h or 4°0°2 h to overnight.5.  Prepare primary antibody. LC3B antibody from cell signaling can be diluted at 1/200-1/500 in AbDil-Tx. Usually one coverslip need 30-100~ul .6.  Transfer coverslips to the humid chamber. It can be made from a 15 cm round tissue culture plate. Cut a piece of square or rectangle parafilm that can fit the bottom of the plate. Use finger and tweezer to press down to make the parafilm adhere tightly to the bottom of the plate. The coverslips can then sit on the parafilm with liquid on top. Use a sheet of foil that can cover the lid of the plate to protect the coverslips from light. Incubating coverslips in this humid chamber will protect the coverslips from light in all steps. Use wet kimwipes to keep the humid chamber humid to prevent antibody evaporation.7.  Add diluted LC3B antibody onto the coverslips. Incubate at room temperature for -4 or at 4~^°C overnight. If incubate overnight, make sure to add at least 50~ul to each coverslip and wet the kimwipes in the humid chamber in case of antibody evaporation.8.  While  incubating,  prepare  secondary  antibodies  by  diluting  fluorescently  labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody into AdDil-Tx.9.  After incubation, wash LC3B antibody away by holding a transfer pipette filled with TBS-Txin one hand and a pipe that is attached to a liquid bottle and a vacuum pump to remove washing solution. Let TBS-Tx flow through the coverslips to wash the antibody away. Each coverslip needs to be washed 3 times with around ^2m of TBS-Tx each time.10. Add diluted secondary antibody onto coverslips and incubate at room temperature for around 1-2 h. After incubation, wash the coverslips in the same way as above.11. Take the mounting medium, ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI out of freezer around 10 minutes before the end of incubation to let it warm up to room temperature. Squeeze out a small drop (around 2-3ul ) of mounting medium onto the slide.12. Suck off the liquid on the coverslips as complete as possible and mound the coverslips onto the slide, on the top of ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium. Remember to keep the cell side down and keep them with direct contact with mounting medium.13. The ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium usually needs overnight to solidify and this step needs to be done at room temperature. Leave slides in a drawer or other space protected from light overnight to let it dry.14. When the slides are ready, take it to a fluorescent microscope to observe and take pictures (Figure 1).()Figure 1. LC3B immunofluorescence shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells. Hela cells were treated with indicated concentrations of Torin2 for 3 days stained antibody specific for LC3B and DAPI.# B. LC3B western blot1.  Tissue-culture cells are plated on 12-well plate (or 6-well plate) one day before experiment to let the cells attach to coverslips.2.  On the day of experiment, 10 u/ml of E64d/pepstatin A were added to cells one hour before to increase autophagy turnover. Different concentrations of small molecule compounds were then added to cells.3.  After desired time of incubation, wash cells once with PBS. Then lyse cells in lysis buffer by directly overlay 100-200ul lysis buffer (M-PER with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor) on the cells and incubate on ice (or 4^°C_. ) for 10-20 min .4.  At the end of incubation, collect cell lysate in a 1.5ml tube and spin 1 minute at max speed and 4^°C to remove cell debris.5.  Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, normalize, and add sample buffer. For drugs treated for a couple of hours, it’s usually not needed to normalize them since they normally don’t affect the cell numbers. However, for longer treatment (longer than a few hours), people should normalize the protein concentration across samples. Boil and load on a SDS-PAGE. Either a 15% SDS-PAGE or a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel id good for separating LC3B bands.6.  Transfer gel into a PVDF membrane as the standard western blot protocol.7.  Block the PVDF membrane in TBS-Tween (“TBS-T”) with 5% Non-fat dry milk for 1h at room temperature on a shaker.8.  Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare LC3B antibody by diluting it at 1/1small,000 into AbDil-Tw.9.  Incubate membrane in diluted LC3B at room temperature for ^2-3h or at 4^°C overnight.10. Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare HRP-conjugated secondary antibody by diluting it at 1/1,000 into AbDil-Tw.11. Incubate membrane in diluted secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour.12. Wash with TBS-T for 5 minutes, 3 times.13. Gently use paper towel to dry the membrane and place it face up and flat on a sheet of plastic wrap.14. Use prepared ECL to detect protein. Drain ECL and gently use paper towel and kimwipes to dry the membrane.15. Wrap up the membrane with plastic wrap.16. Either expose it to an X-ray film or use an imaging machine (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Western blot of LC3 shows that Torin2 induces apoptosis and autophagy in cells. Indicated cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of AZD8055 or Torin2 for 3 days before the cells and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-LC3B and anti-tubulin antibodies.C.  Acridine orange assay1.  Tissue cultured cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plate one day before as introduced in LC3B immunofluorescence.2.  One the day of experiment, cells are treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired amount of time before 1 u/ m I acridine orange was added for 15 min.3.  Cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde, washed with TBS-Tx before they are mounted in Prolong Gold with DAPI, which is the same as step A11 and A12.4.  Pictures were taken by a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3, left panel).5.  Total fluorescence of acridine orange in each frame was quantified using MetaMorph and divided by the total number of cells within the frame. Numbers are then normalized to DMSO-treated cells to show the acridine orange fold changes (Figure 3, right panel).()Figure 3. Acridine orange assay shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells.

The schematic view of general procedures for the isolation of primary myoblasts from hind limb muscle of mice. MGM, myoblast growth medium; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DM, differentiation medium.A.  Before isolation of primary myoblasts1.  Autoclave two sets of tools in sterilization pouches each containing one small pair of scissorsand forceps (see Notes 1 and 2).2.  Following Recipe 1, prepare 70% ethanol.3.  Following Recipe 2, prepare 10% Matrigel (see Note 3).4.  Following Recipe 3, prepare collagenase II (see Note 4).5.  Following Recipe 4, prepare base of digestion medium (see Notes 5 and 6).Copyright  2017 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.6.  Following Recipe 5, prepare collection/washing/mincing solution.7.  Following Recipe 6, prepare neutralization/isolation medium (see Note 5).8.  Following Recipe 8, prepare myoblast growth medium (MGM) (see Note 5).9.  Coat 100×20~mm Petri dishes (one plate per mouse) by pouring and spreading 10% Matrigel solution enough to cover the plate area. Avoid bubbles. After 30 sec, remove excess Matrigel solution (excess 10% Matrigel can be collected and stored for re-use multiple times, if kept sterile). Leave the plate without cap to dry in sterile air flow in a biosafety cabinet (20m i n) . Once dried, put lid on the plate and leave in sterile biosafety cabinet at room temperature until ready to use. There is no need to turn on UV light of biosafety cabinet. This plate will be used for isolation and culturing of myoblasts following digestion of muscle with collagenase.10. For muscle collection and washing before digestion, prepare a 6-well plate containing 3 ml/well of collection/washing/mincing solution (only 4 wells of a 6-well plate needed per mouse).11. For muscle mincing following isolation, prepare two 1.5~ml Eppendorf tubes per mouse each containing 500ul of collection/washing/mincing solution.B.  Muscle removal and washing1.  Euthanize mouse following approved IACUC guidelines in your laboratory. For purpose of this protocol, the mouse was given intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at a dose of 250 mg/kg, followed by cervical dislocation.2.  The isolation of hind limb muscles from mice is performed outside a biosafety cabinet. For this step, no sterile techniques are necessary except autoclaved dissection tools and spray of ethanol. Spray hind-limbs with 70% ethanol and pin the mouse face up.3.  Remove skin using autoclaved scissors from both hind-limbs to expose muscles.4.  Using the first pair of autoclaved scissors and forceps, collect tibial anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps and extensor digitorum longus muscles from one hind-limb and place them into one well of 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (Video 1).Video 1. Isolation of hind limb muscles from mouse. This video shows basic steps for isolation of hind limb muscles from euthanized mouse and transferring them into a 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution.()5.  Repeat the previous step on the other hind limb and place the muscles in the second well of 6- well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (see Note 9).6.  Transfer the muscles using the second pair of autoclaved forceps to the other two wells of the 6-well plate filled with collection/washing/mincing solution. This is needed to wash and remove any sticking hair or unwanted tissue on isolated muscles.7.  Put the lid on the 6-well plate containing muscle and collection/washing/mincing solution and spray with 70% ethanol before transferring the plate to a sterile biosafety cabinet. From this step onwards, all the procedure must be performed in biosafety cabinet to avoid potential contamination of myofibers.C.  Muscle mincing/digestion1.  Transfer washed muscles using second pair of autoclaved forceps to two 1.5~ml Eppendorf tubes (one tube for each hind limb muscle group) containing collection/washing/mincing solution and mince muscles very finely using second pair of autoclaved scissors (see Note 10).2.  Once muscles are minced, spin-down tubes using an RT centrifuge at 21, 130xg for 30 sec to separate the minced muscle pieces from the collection/washing/mincing solution.3.  Set spun tubes aside under sterile biosafety cabinet.4.  Complete preparation of digestion media by adding 1 ml of collagenase II to base of digestion media prepared previously (see Note 6). Filter the entire digestion mixture using a 0.22~um syringe filter into a 15ml tube.5.  Remove the supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes containing the minced muscles (in step C2).6.  To transfer the minced muscles to digestion media tube, cut off the tip of a sterile 1 ml pipette tip to create a large bore to accommodate minced muscles’ size.7.  Transfer a small amount of digestion media to the Eppendorf tubes to resuspend minced muscle and then transfer the mix (minced muscles ^+ digestion media) to the original 15~ml digestion media tube (in step C4).8.  Repeat step C7 until all the minced muscles are transferred from the Eppendorf tubes to the 15 ml tube containing digestion mixture.9.  Close the lid of the 15ml tube containing minced muscle and digestion media and wrap the lid with Parafilm to avoid any potential leakage.10. Vortex tube for 5 sec.11. Place tube horizontally in a 37^°C shaker and shake at 100 rpm for 1 h with another 5 sec vortex half way through (see Note 11).12. After 1h , mix should appear cloudy and muscle pieces should be mostly digested and very small (see Note 12).13. Once digestion is complete, vortex tube containing digested muscle mixture for 5 sec.14. Spin the tubes at 1,400xg for 5 min at room temperature.15. Under sterile biosafety cabinet, remove supernatant (digestion media) and discard.16. Resuspend digested muscle pellet in 7m of neutralizing/isolation media using a 10 ml serological pipette. Pipet the digested muscle tissue pellet up and down for 20-30 times using a sterile 10ml pipette. This ensures that most myoblasts are released from the muscle tissues.17. Place a 70um strainer on a 50 m l tube.18. Pre-wet the 70um strainer with _2m l of neutralizing/isolation media.19. Collect resuspended muscle pellet mixture (step C16) using a 10 ml serological pipette and pass through the pre-wet 70um strainer.20. Wash the strainer with _2m l of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are sticking to strainer (most tissue debris will be removed during this step).21. In a 15ml tube, pre-wet a 30um filter with 1~ml of neutralizing/isolation media.22. Pass cell mixture (previously strained through 70um strainer) through the pre-wet 30um filter. This step will remove large infiltrating cells such as macrophages from the myoblasts.23. Wash filter with 1 ml of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are not sticking to the strainer.24. Spin tubes containing cellular mixture at 1,400xg for 5min .25. Remove supernatant (neutralizing/isolation media) and resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml M G M+ bFGF.26. Seed the cellular mixtures onto the 10% Matrigel pre-coated dish.27. Visualize the cells under a microscope. At this step, there will be a heterogeneous mixture of muscle particles and cells (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Representative phase contrast microscopy images of primary myoblast cultures at various stages of purification. Digested muscle mixture following filtration at seeding in 10% Matrigel-coated culturing dish at (A) ^0h , (B) ^24h , and (C) 72h . Appearance of myoblasts after (D) first pre-plating and (E) second pre-plating steps. F. Purified myoblast cultures after 2-4 pre-plating steps. Scale bars =20~um . Blue arrows point to tissue/cellular debris; Red arrows point to fibroblasts (large and flat triangular-shaped) and green arrows point to myoblasts (round or bipolar spindle-shaped).28. Keep the dish in a 37^°C CO2 incubator for 72 h. Do not change medium during this incubation period.29. After 72h , you should be able to visualize adherent, small, droplet-shaped myoblasts and large triangular-shaped fibroblasts in addition to remnant tissue debris.30. At this time, the cells are ready for first pre-plating (see Note 13).D.  Myoblast purification (Pre-Plating)1.  Remove culture media from the dish.2.  Using a 10ml serological pipette, gently wash adherent cells two times with post-isolation media (F-10 medium containing 1% Pen/Strep).3.  Detach cells by adding 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and placing cells at 37^°C in a C O_2 incubator for 2 min.4.  Visualize under the microscope to ensure that all cells are detached.5.  Once cells are detached, add 10ml of M G M+b F G F to dish (see Note 14).6.  Transfer cell mixture to a non-Matrigel coated tissue culture dish and place at 37~^°C in a C O_2 incubator for 45 min. This will allow larger cells such as fibroblasts to adhere in the bottom of the dish while most myoblasts would still be suspended in the media.7.  During this time, coat a new Petri dish with 10% Matrigel as described above.8.  After 45 min, transfer all supernatant from pre-plating dish to the new Matrigel-coated dish and place the dish in  G O_2 incubator (see Note 15).9.  Pre-plating step should be performed every 36-48 h until >98% myoblast purity is achieved (see Note 16). Representative phase contrast images at various steps of myoblast isolation are presented in Figures 2C-2E. Purified myoblast culture image is presented in Figure 2F.E.  Culturing of myoblasts1.  The purified myoblasts are maintained in culture by incubation in the myoblast growth medium and changing media every other day.2.  Do not allow cells to reach >70% confluency (unless experimentally required) as this will lead to pre-mature differentiation and fusion of myoblasts with each other.3.  Expand cells by splitting into multiple 10% Matrigel-coated Petri dishes as needed.4.  The myoblasts can be collected in freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen tank or -80~^°C freezer like any other cultured cells. Primary myoblasts maintain their proliferation and differentiation capacity once thawed and cultured again.F.  Differentiating primary myoblasts to myotubes1.  Coat tissue culture plates with 10% Matrigel similar to those described above.2.  Plate primary myoblasts in pre-coated Matrigel plates. For obtaining good quality myotubes, myoblasts should be at 85-95% confluency before adding differentiation medium (DM). For a 6- well tissue culture plate, we need 0.75–0.9×10^6 cells per well; however, this number will vary depending on the cell passage number. Low passage cells are normally smaller in size therefore use the higher end of the range to achieve desired confluency, whereas higher passage cells are more elongated and larger in size so the lower end of cell number will be required (see Note 17).3.  Next day, replace myoblast growth medium with DM (see Note 18).4.  DM should be changed every 48 h .5.  Myoblasts align and fusion starts within 24-36 h after incubation in DM.

Liver mitochondria isolationAnimal handling, euthanasia, and dissection must be done following the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. We have successfully utilized carbon dioxide asphyxiation before cervical dislocation to euthanize the mice. However, we advise the reader to consult and follow the Animal Care and Use guidelines of their own institute for the appropriate procedure. Following steps involved in animal handling and dissection are executed wearing gloves.1.  Visualize the liver, the bile duct, and gallbladder. The bile duct and gallbladder must be removed or kept separate from the liver to avoid contamination of the mitochondria with bile (Figure 1ac).2.  Excise the four liver lobes and transfer immediately to a 50 ml conical tube containing ice-cold PBS. In case of blood contamination, soak the liver in ice-cold PBS until no more blood is washed out (Figure 1d-e).Note: From this point, all the steps must be performed using reagents and materials at 4^°C to minimize the activation of proteases and phospholipases.()# Figure 1. Mouse dissection3.  Transfer the liver with forceps to a clean Petri dish placed on ice and drain off the excess PBS.4.  Mince the liver using a clean razor blade until forming a homogeneous paste (Figure 2).5.  Transfer half of the liver paste using the razor blade as a spoon into a chilled Potter-Elvehjemdounce homogenizer containing 10ml TIB.6.  Insert the pestle into the homogenizer and gently push it downwards. Early resistance iscommon during the first strokes, and no excessive force should be applied to the liver paste. Instead, move the pestle upwards to resuspend the liver paste and slowly repeat those steps until all the material is able to go past the pestle without strong resistance. The homogenization step can be done on the bench as long the whole procedure is done quickly enough to maintain the temperature close to 4^°C .7.  Homogenize the paste five times, pour into a 15~ml conical tube and store on ice until all the liver paste is processed (Figure 2).8.  Repeat steps 6-8 with the second half of the liver paste.9.  The following differential centrifugation steps are required to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. All the steps should be performed in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4~^°C . Resuspension of pellets is done gently by pipetting using a P1000 pipette (Figure 2).a. 600xg for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant (S/N) to a clean, pre-chilled 15ml conical tube.b. 3,500xg for 10 min. Discard the S/N. Resuspend the pellet in 10ml TIB.c. 1,500xg for 5 min. Transfer the S/N to a clean, pre-chilled 15ml conical tube.d. 5,500× g for 10min . Discard the S/N. Resuspend the pellet in 10ml TIB.e.  Repeat steps A9b to A9d, but resuspend the final pellet in 500ul TIB.10. To quantify the amount of isolated material in the resuspended pellet (step A9e), add 5ul of the resuspended pellet to 995~ul of TIB (1:200 dilution) and measure the OD520 with a spectrophotometer. Dilute the mitochondria with TIB to standardize the sample to an OD520 value of 0.25 (20u/ul of protein).11. At this point the isolated mitochondria can be aliquoted (50~u/) , frozen in dry ice-ethanol to prevent formation of water crystals, and stored at -80~^°C .Note: Freshly isolated mitochondria from the previous step should be kept on ice and used within _2h to ensure integrity of the outer membrane. If frozen mitochondria are used, thaw the sample in a 30~^°C water bath and continue using TIB in the subsequent procedures.()B.  Mitochondria labeling with JC-1 and size fractionationLabeling mitochondria with JC-1, a potential-dependent mitochondrial dye that changes color as membrane potentials increase during MOMP, allows to standardize the mitochondria fractions and to record MOMP in real-time (as example, see Renault et al., 2015, Figure 4F). The labeling and fractionation step offers the opportunity to select the mitochondria by size: big mitochondria will be eluted prior to smaller ones. This fractionation step is optional and requires to calibrate the column using liposomes of a known size as a standard. Another option is to determine the average mitochondrial size in each fraction a posteriori, using for example dynamic light scattering. If fractionation by size is not desired, all the mitochondria-containing fractions can be combined in step B8.1.  Dilute 50ul of mitochondria in 250ul TIB buffer.2.  Add JC-1 (200~uM) to the diluted mitochondria to a final concentration of 15uM and incubate for 10 min at 30^°C (Figure 3).()Mitochondrial Labeling and Size FractionationFigure 3. Mitochondrial labeling and size fractionation3.  To remove unbound JC-1, centrifuge the mitochondria at 5,550xg for 10 min at room temperature and resuspend the pellet in 25ul TIB.4.  Pre-equilibrate a 2 ml CL-2B gravity-column with 2 column volumes of TIB (4~ml) using gravity to let the TIB to flow through the CL-2B resin, load the resuspended JC-1 mitochondria onto the column, and allow sample to flow through.5.  Slowly apply 4 column volumes of TIB (4×2ml) to the column using a clean Pasteur pipet and collect 20×100ul ( 2-3 drops) fractions in micro-centrifuge tubes.6.  To determine which fractions contain labeled mitochondria, pre-fill a 96-well plate with 95~ul of 0.1% Triton X-100 in water 1.1% Triton X-100 permeabilizes mitochondria) and add 5ul sample of each fraction to a separate well.7.  Measure the fluorescence using a spectrophotometer E X:561 n m/E m:620n m) to identify the mitochondria-containing fractions (typical values are 10,000-50,000 Relative Fluorescence Units for big mitochondria, and >500 RFU for small size mitochondria).8.  Combine the desired fractions containing JC-1 labeled mitochondria and standardize the samples using relative JC-1 fluorescence intensity (determine the fluorescence of each combined sample as described in step B6-7 and dilute the most concentrated samples with TIB buffer to reach the concentration of the lowest sample). Note: In our experience 0.05-1 µm liposomes were subjected onto the CL-2B gravity-column and used as reference for selecting appropriate fractions. Briefly, fluorescent liposomes of several sizes (0.05, 0.2, and 1 µm) were prepared according to Asciolla et al., 2012. The liposomes were loaded onto the CL-2B gravity column and 100 µl fractions were collected, as described in steps B4-6 of this protocol. Identification of liposome-containing fractions for each liposome size allows to determine in which fractions vesicles of a given size should be expected.C. Real-time MOMP measurementsReal-time MOMP quantification is determined by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (_M) using the fluorescent JC-1 dye. The JC-1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green ( 529 n m) to red (590 n m) . MOMP and the subsequent loss of _M are indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. There is a plethora of options to investigate a subset of inducers and regulators of MOMP in real-time. It is important to have internal and experimental controls. An example is given in Table 1. For the positive internal control, we use FCCP that uncouples the electron transport from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and completely depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane. To generate a positive experimental control, we use detergent-activated recombinant BAX (Hsu and Youle, 1997). The detergent,  -octylglucoside (OG), artificially triggers BAX activation, and therefore BAXOG (20-50n M) can be used as a reliable positive control (for 100ul of 2.3uM BAXOG: 5ug BAX +0.7% OG in liposome buffer, incubate for 60 min at 4^°C , aliquot and store at -80^°C_. ).Real-time measurements1.  Prepare a 2x proteins/inducers solution in TIB and dispense 50ul in each well in a 96-well plate. The plate should contain the following internal and experimental controls (Figure 4; Table 1)a.  Negative internal control: TIB onlyb.  Positive internal control: FCCP ( 10uM final concentration)c. Negative experimental control: purified recombinant BAX (20-50 nM final concentration)d. Positive experimental control:  -octylglucoside-activated BAX (BAXOG, 20-50 nM final concentration)()Real-Time MOMPFigure 4. Real-Time MOMP2.  Prepare a 2x suspension of JC-1 loaded mitochondria (2.5R F U/uI) and add 50ul to each well to reach a final concentration of 1.25:R F U/muI . Note: ~50-100 RFUs per reaction is ideal.3.  Measure fluorescence every 5 min in a plate reader for 60~m i n (Ex: 561 nm/Em: 620 nm) at 37^°C .4.  Calculate the percentage of mitochondria that have undergone MOMP using the following formula:% MOMP = (RFUbuffer − RFUsample) / (RFUbuffer − RFUFCCP)Where RFUbuffer and RFUFCCP represent the fluorescence of the negative and positive internal controls, respectively, and RFUsample the fluorescence of the sample (see Figure 4G-H as example in Renault et al., 2015).Table 1.

Add 125~ul Tris phenol and 125~ul Trichloromethane, vigorously vortex for 10 sec. Then, centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. This step can separate protein from nucleic acid and nucleic acid would be in the aqueous upper layer.3.  Transfer aqueous upper layer into a new 1.5ml tube.4.  Add 20 u Yeast RNA (as a co-precipitant here), 0.1 volume NaOAc and 0.7 volume Isopropyl alcohol. After inverting several times, precipitate the mixture overnight at - -20~^°C .5.  Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 15min at 4^°C and throw away the supernatant.6.  Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol and gently invert.7.  Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4^°C and throw away the supernatant.8.  Dry the DNA pellet for 510 min (air-drying) and dissolve in 20~ul ddH2O as the PCR template.B.  Amplification of HBV DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1.  PCR system:()Add ddH2O to a final volume of 50ul .2.  PCR reaction program: 94 °C, 5 min 94 °C, 30 sec 55 °C, 30 sec 40 cycles 68 °C, 2 min 68 °C, 10 min 1.15k bFor the fragment amplification, P2 and P4 primers are used and the extension proceeding of PCR reaction program should be changed from 68^°C , 2 min to 68^°C , 1 min.3.  Add 10x DNA loading buffer to each sample and mix by pipetting. Purifying the PCR product by running on a 1% agarose gel at 100nu for 30min . Note: The size of gel used here is 6 cm; the voltage/run-time would vary by the gel rig used.C.  Gel extraction of HBV DNA1.  Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination. Briefly place the excised gel slice on absorbent toweling to remove residual buffer. Transfer the gel slice to a piece or plastic wrap or a weighing boat. Mince the gel into small pieces and weigh. In this application, the weight of gel is regarded as equivalent to the volume. For example, 100 mg of gel is equivalent to a 100~ul volume. Transfer the gel slice into a 1.5~ml microfuge tube.Note: Alternatively, the gel slice can be placed into the 1.5 ml microfuge tube and then crushed with a pipette tip or other suitable device. Spin the tube for 30 sec at 12,000x g to consolidate the gel at the bottom of the tube. Use the graduations to estimate the volume of the agarose gel.2.  Add a 3x sample volume of Buffer DE-A. Note: The color of Buffer DE-A is red. This color is used to add contrast in the next step, so that any pieces of unsolubilized agarose can be visualized.3.  Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75~^°C until the gel is completely dissolved (typically, 6-8 m i n ). Heat at 40^°C if low-melt agarose gel is used. Intermittent vortexing (every 2-3m i n ) will accelerate gel solubilization. IMPORTANT: Gel must be completely dissolved or the DNA fragment recovery will be reduced. IMPORTANT: Do not heat the gel for longer than 10 min.4.  Add 0.5x Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B, mix. If the DNA fragment is less than 400b p , supplement further with a 1x sample volume of isopropanol.Example: For a 1% gel slice equivalent to 100ul , add the following: • 300ul Buffer DE-A • 150ul Buffer DE-B If the DNA fragment is <400 bp, you would also add: • 100ul of isopropanolNote: The color of the mixture will turn yellow after the addition of Buffer DE-B. Please make sure the contents are a uniform yellow color before proceeding.5.  Place a Miniprep column into a _2~scriptsize~m~ microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from step C4 into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.6.  Discard the filtrate from the _2m l microfuge tube.

Return the Miniprep column to the 2 ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 sec. Note: Make sure that 95-100% ethanol has been added into Buffer W2 concentrate. Make a notation on the bottle label for future reference.8.  Discard the filtrate from the _2ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the ^2ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700~ul aliquot of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.Note: Two washes with Buffer W2 are used to ensure the complete removal of salt, eliminating potential problems in subsequent enzymatic reactions, such as ligation and sequencing reaction.9.  Discard the filtrate from the _2ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the _2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.10. Transfer the Miniprep column into a clean 1.5~ml microfuge tube (provided). To elute the DNA, add 25-30ul of Eluent or deionized water to the center of the membrane. Let it stand for 1 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min. Notes:a.  Pre-warming the Eluent at 65~^°C will generally improve elution efficiency.b.  Deionized water can also be used to elute the DNA fragments.c.  More detailed information can refer to the PDF protocol file attached here.# D.  Add dATP to generate 3’ overhangs1.

Add 1 ml LB medium, incubate at 37^°C shaker for 1~h~ .4.  Centrifuge at 8,000 rpm for 2 min at room temperature and throw away the supernatant, use 50uIL B medium to re-suspend the bacteria precipitate.5.  Add 2 μl IPTG (storage concentration: 20% , m/V_, )  and  20  μl X-gal (storage concentration: 2% , m/V ) and mix by pipetting, then spread the solution on Amp resistance plate (final concentration of Amp: 50ugim/ml) .6.  Put the plate at 37^°C bacteriological incubator for 12-16h .7.  Choose the white clones to get the HBV DNA-integrated plasmid.G. Extract HBV DNA-integrated plasmid from E.coli-DH5α1.  Isolate a single white colony from the plate (step F6), and inoculate a culture of 5~ml LB medium containing the Amp antibiotic. Incubate for 12-16h at 37^°C with vigorous shaking (300r p m) . Use a 10-20 ml culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.2.  Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 1 min at room temperature.3.  Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.4.  Add 250~ul Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields. Note: RNase A must be added to Solution I before use. Please see the instructions (attached here) in the Preparing Reagents section on Page 6.5.  Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.6.  Add 250~ul Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2-3 min incubation may be necessary. Note: Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 min. Store Solution II tightly capped when not in use to avoid acidification from C O_2 in the air.7.  Add 350~ul Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms. Note: It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.8.  Centrifuge at maximum speed (13,000xg) for 10 min. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.9.  Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a _2ml Collection Tube.10.

Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.13. Add 500ulH B Buffer.14. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.15. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.16. Add 700ul DNA Wash Buffer. Note: DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with hbar0O% ethanol prior to use. Please see Page 6 (attached here) for instructions.17. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.18. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.19. Centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column for 2 min at maximum speed to drythe column matrix.Note: It is important to dry the HiBind® DNA Mini Column matrix before elution.Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications.20. Transfer the HiBind® DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.21. Add 30-100~ul Elution Buffer or sterile deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.Note: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind® DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH. If using sterile deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.22. Let sit at room temperature for 1 min.23. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Note: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.24.

SPSS 15.0 for Windows® (LEAD Technologies Inc.)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nA major requirement for this protocol is to experimentally establish the optimum concentration of CFW or CR to be used. This may be influenced by several parameters, including size of the inoculum, genetic background of the strains and composition of the growth medium. The wild type strain used in our laboratory was Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (strain 4287/FGSC 9935). Appropriate CFW and CR concentration should be sublethal for the wild-type or reference strain used in the experiment. We typically define this parameter by inoculating serial dilutions of conidia in the form of spots on plates containing CFW and CR, with concentrations in the range of 10200 u9/ m I of CFW and 5600 u9/ m1 of CR.1.  Production of fresh microconidia (3-4 d) Inoculate 50ul of a -80^°C stock microconidial suspension (in 30% glycerol) into 50 ml of liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB) (see Recipe 1). Grow cultures for 3-4 d at 28~°0 with shaking at 170 rpm (Di Pietro and Roncero, 1998). Filter microconidia through one layer of Miracloth, centrifuge and wash with sterile water. Count conidia using a Neubauer chamber and adjust to a final concentration of 1×10^7 conidia/ml.2.  Preparation of stock solutions of CFW (20m g/m l) and CR (50m g/m l) (1 h) (see Recipe 2)3.  Preparation of growth medium (1-2 h) Prepare growth agar medium and autoclave (20 min at 120 ^°C_A ). Cool the medium down to 50- 60^°C in a water bath before adding CR and CFW to avoid any potentially harming fumes. Then, add CFW or CR to reach the desired concentrations. This can be done in a laminar flow hood. For F. oxysporum, we suggest to start by testing 4-5 different dye concentrations, in the following range: 10 to 200u/ml for CFW and 10 to 600u/ml for CR. Additionally, prepare a control plate without the dyes. The plates can be stored overnight, at room temperature and in the dark, to be used the next day.4.  Preparation of a serial dilution of microconidia (1-2 h) Prepare a 10-fold serial dilution of freshly-obtained microconidia starting with the 1 × 10^7 conidia/ml stock solution generated in step 1 (1×10^7,1×10^6, 1×10^5 and 1×10^4 conidial/ml). Inoculate 2~ul drops of this series on plates containing CFW or CR and a control plate (final concentrations: 2×10^4,2×10^3,2×10^2 and 2 x 10 conidia/ml). We typically use square ( 120~× 120m m_ ) Petri dishes, to allow sufficient space for growth of the fungal colonies.5.  Incubation of plates (2-3 d) Incubate plates at 28~^°C in the dark for ^2-3textupd .6.  Interpreting and monitoring resultsa.  Sensitivity to CFW and CR should be determined by comparing the extent of colony formation of parental and mutant strains in control and CFW or CR plates. Colony diameter may be measured for quantification of differences in colony growth of the strains tested. For this, inoculate each single strain (a 5~ul drop of a 1×10^7 microconidia/ml suspension) on the control and cell wall stress plates, with 5 replicates each. We use round ( igcirc0m m diameter) Petri dishes. Incubate the plates at 28^°C for 5 d before scanning and measuring colony diameter.b.  Data from three independent experiments, each with five replicates, can then be analyzed with a statistic software such as SPSS 15.0 for Windows®. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney test are used to assess statistically relevant differences among strains at Peq0.05 .\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction and Preparation\nExperimentally establish the optimum concentration of CFW or CR to be used, considering parameters such as inoculum size, genetic background of strains, and composition of the growth medium.\nDefine the sublethal concentration for the wild-type or reference strain used in the experiment by inoculating serial dilutions of conidia on plates containing CFW and CR.\n## Production of Fresh Microconidia\nInoculate 50ul of a -80°C stock microconidial suspension into 50 ml of liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB).\nGrow cultures for 3-4 days at 28°C with shaking at 170 rpm.\nFilter microconidia through one layer of Miracloth, centrifuge, and wash with sterile water.\nCount conidia using a Neubauer chamber and adjust to a final concentration of 1×10^7 conidia/ml.\n## Preparation of Stock Solutions and Growth Medium\nPrepare stock solutions of CFW (20mg/ml) and CR (50mg/ml).\nPrepare growth agar medium and autoclave for 20 minutes at 120°C.\nCool the medium to 50-60°C in a water bath before adding CR and CFW.\nAdd CFW or CR to reach the desired concentrations, starting with 4-5 different dye concentrations for F. oxysporum.\n## Preparation of Serial Dilution of Microconidia and Inoculation\nPrepare a 10-fold serial dilution of freshly obtained microconidia starting with the 1×10^7 conidia/ml stock solution.\nInoculate 2ul drops of the serial dilution on plates containing CFW or CR and a control plate.\nUse square (120×120mm) Petri dishes to allow sufficient space for growth of the fungal colonies.\n## Incubation and Monitoring\nIncubate plates at 28°C in the dark for 2-3 days.\nMonitor and interpret results by comparing the extent of colony formation of parental and mutant strains in control and CFW or CR plates.\n## Data Analysis\nMeasure colony diameter for quantification of differences in colony growth of the strains tested.\nAnalyze data from three independent experiments, each with five replicates, using statistical software such as SPSS 15.0 for Windows.\nUse Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney test to assess statistically relevant differences among strains at P≤0.05.","evidence_ids":["Protocol-exchange-669","Protocol.io-6471","Protocol.io-6479","Bio-protocol-746","Protocol.io-6483","Bio-protocol-291","Protocol.io-6487","Protocol-exchange-737","Bio-protocol-1778","Protocol-exchange-705"]}

Bacterial cultureMycobacterium tuberculosis strains are grown at 37~^°C in 7H9 OADC media (see Recipes) in standing culture in T25 flasks until mid-log phase (O D_6000.6) . Bacterial cultures are started from frozen stocks and maintained for no more than 5 passages. Constitutive expression of fluorescent protein by Mtb is required for further detection. We used Mtb Erdman strains with an integrated pMV306 plasmid expressing mCherry from smyc promoter (smyc’::mCherry). This plasmid confers kanamycin resistance, therefore growth media contains kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 mu g/m l (see Recipes).a.  Do not grow more than 10 ml of bacterial culture in a T25 flask to ensure sufficient amount of oxygen available to Mtb. To estimate timing for bacterial culture growth, consider that Mtb divides approximately once in two days when grown in standing culture. More details on bacterial culture growth for macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).b.  We advise testing your wild type strain constitutively expressing fluorescent protein for ability to efficiently intake Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection by microscopy. We havenoticed that in Mtb Erdman strain expression of mCherry under strong promoter (smyc’ or hsp60’) from replicating plasmid impacts Bodipy-palmitate uptake. However CDC1551 strain with the same plasmid demonstrated high level of fatty acid uptake. Additionally, care should be taken to determine by confocal microscopy if Bodipy-palmitate accumulates within bacteria versus on their surface.# B.  Macrophage isolation and culturingMacrophages of various origins can be used. We differentiated macrophages from bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice and maintained in BMDM media (see Recipes) with antibiotics at 37~^°C and 6.0% C O_2 for 10 days before infection.# Infection1.  The day before infection seed macrophages in antibiotic-free BMDM media into T150 tissue culture flasks angle3×10^7 cells and 40-50~ml of BMDM media per flask) to obtain confluent monolayers. If macrophages are of limited numbers one T75 flask with 1×10^7 cells would provide sufficient results, however, two T150 flasks angle6×10^7 cells) would give easily detectable pellet of bacteria at the end of the experiment.2.  On the day of infection measure optical density of mid-log Mtb culture. Assuming that O D_600 of 0.6 equals 10^8 bacteria/ml, centrifuge required amount of culture at 3,300 rpm (2,500× g) for 12 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. We infect macrophages at MOI of 4:1, therefore to infect 6×10^7 cells we need 2.4×10^8 bacteria. To ensure that sufficient numbers of bacteria are pelleted we routinely centrifuge 3ml of bacteria at O D_600=0.6 . Notes: As estimation of bacterial numbers may vary, one may want to determine it on their own. However, to achieve higher replicability in terms of MOI, we advise adhering to our estimation. More details on macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).3.  Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1.5ml of BUB (see Recipes). Pass bacterial suspension through a 1m tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle 12-20 times the same syringe and needle. Add 3.5 m l of BUB to the suspension to obtain 5m in total and mix thoroughly.4.  Add 2.4~ml of bacterial suspension to each T150 flask containing 3×10^7 cells. Mix well, but gently. Incubate at 37~^°C and 6% C O_2 for 4h .5.  Remove extracellular bacteria by replacing with fresh pre-warmed antibiotic free BMDM media. Infected macrophages are maintained in BMDM medium at 37~^°C and 6% C O_2 for 3 days. Changing media on the second day of infection is optional.# Labeling1.  On the day of labeling (third day of infection) pre-warm sterile 1% fatty acid-free BSA (see Recipes) in PBS at 37~^°C for 30-60 min. Add 4 mM stock of Bodipy-palmitate (see Recipes) to obtain 100~uM concentration. For labeling one T75 flask add 50~ul of 4m M Bodipy-palmitatestock to 1.95ml of 1% fatty acid-free BSA. Mix well by vortexing until the solution turns green.Keep at 37~^°C and protect from light.# Notes:a.  The day of labeling can be chosen with consideration of the questions you are trying to address. We tested uptake of Bodipy-palmitate at various stages of macrophage infection, and noted that before the third day of infection the uptake levels are not sufficient to be detected. b.  In addition to Bodipy-palmitate, we have tested Bodipy FL C12 and Bodipy 558/568 C12. Bodipy FL C12 accumulated in intracellular bacteria as efficiently as Bodipy-palmitate, while  Bodipy  558/568  C12  was  poorly  assimilated  by  Mtb.  We  chose  to  use Bodipy-palmitate as fatty acids of the length (16 carbons) are more commonly found in the membranes of macrophages infected with Mtb.2.  For labeling one T75 flask add 1.6~ml of 100~uM Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA (from Step 1 of Labeling) to 18.4~ml of pre-warmed cuvette buffer (see Recipes) such that the final concentration of the labeled lipid is 8uM , mix well. Use 15~ml for labeling one T75 flask, and 30~ml for labeling one T50 flask. Increase volumes in Steps 1 and 2 (Labeling) accordingly for larger infections.3.  Remove media from infected macrophages and replace with cuvette buffer containing Bodipy-palmitate (volumes are described in Step 2 of Labeling). Incubate the infected macrophages with label at 37~^°C and 6.0% C O_2 for 1h .4.  After the 1 h labeling period, remove the cuvette buffer containing the Bodipy-palmitate and add fresh pre-warmed cuvette buffer without label for 1 h. Use 15ml for one T75 flask, and 30 ml for one T150 flask. Proceed to the next step right after 1h incubation without label. Note: Alternatively, Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA can be added directly to infected macrophages cultured in BMDM media. Label chase can be performed in fresh pre-warmed BMDM medium as well. No cuvette buffer is needed in this case. From our experience, either way of labeling gives comparable results.# Isolation of intracellular bacteriaNote: This portion of the protocol is based on phagosome isolation described in (Pethe et al., 2004).1.  Remove  cuvette  buffer  from  labeled  infected  cells,  and  quickly  rinse  with 10 m of Homogenization buffer (see Recipes).2.  Add 15ml of ice-cold Homogenization buffer, incubate at 4~^°C for 10-15 min , and harvest macrophages by scraping off from each flask with cell scrapers. Transfer the cells to a 50~ml conical tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 r p m(514xg) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. This and all the following centrifugations are done at 4^°C to block any further uptake of lipids by bacteria.3.  Remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 1.5ml of Homogenization buffer by pipetting and transfer the cells to a 15~ml conical tube. Lyse the cells by 25-70 passages through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle. Monitor cell lysis under a microscope using glasstic slides with 100 grids. Continue until >95% of the cells are lysed, when intact cells are replaced by cell debris. Note: For safety purposes place glass slide with infected material in 150×15 mm Petri dish.4.  Increase the volume to 5ml by adding Homogenization buffer, resuspend well. Centrifuge cell lysate at 800 rpm (146xg) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, G H-3.8 rotor.5.  Transfer the supernatant (suspension of phagosomes) into a new 15ml conical tube. The pellet mainly consists of nuclei and unlysed cells and is discarded.6.  To the suspension add 20% Tween 80 (see Recipes) to a final concentration of 0.1% , mix well and leave at 4^°C for 15 min to lyse Mtb containing vacuoles.7.  Quickly agitate by shaking and isolate the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,430~x~g) for 15m i n in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.8.  Remove supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of 0.05% tyloxapol in PBS (see Recipes). Centrifuge bacteria down at 3,300 rpm (2,500x g) for 15 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.9.  Optional: repeat the previous step to further remove labeled fatty acids adhered to bacterial cell surface. Note:  Non-specific  binding  of  bodipy-palmitate  to  the  bacterial  cell  surface  produces background signal. However, if tested strains/conditions produce a significant difference in specific uptake of label, this background noise wouldn’t impact results greatly.10. Remove supernatant and fix bacteria in 4% PFA (see Recipes) for ^24~h~ in ^2ml screw-cap tube. Note: If you have flow cytometer in BSL3 facility, bacteria can be analyzed live immediately after isolation and without fixation.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Bacterial Culture\nGrow Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains at 37°C in 7H9 OADC media in standing culture in T25 flasks until mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6).\nStart bacterial cultures from frozen stocks and maintain for no more than 5 passages.\nEnsure constitutive expression of fluorescent protein by Mtb for further detection.\n## Special Considerations\nDo not grow more than 10 ml of bacterial culture in a T25 flask to ensure sufficient oxygen availability to Mtb.\nEstimate timing for bacterial culture growth, considering that Mtb divides approximately once in two days when grown in standing culture.\n## Strain Selection and Validation\nUse Mtb Erdman strains with an integrated pMV306 plasmid expressing mCherry from smyc promoter (smyc'::mCherry).\nTest the wild-type strain constitutively expressing fluorescent protein for the ability to efficiently intake Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection by microscopy.\n## Macrophage Isolation and Culturing\nDifferentiate macrophages from bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice.\nMaintain macrophages in BMDM media with antibiotics at 37°C and 6.0% CO2 for 10 days before infection.\n## Infection\nSeed macrophages in antibiotic-free BMDM media into T150 tissue culture flasks (3 × 10^7 cells and 40-50 ml of BMDM media per flask) to obtain confluent monolayers.\n## Bacterial Preparation\nMeasure the optical density of mid-log Mtb culture.\nCentrifuge the required amount of culture at 3,300 rpm (2,500 × g) for 12 min.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 1.5 ml of BUB.\n## Infection Procedure\nAdd 2.4 ml of bacterial suspension to each T150 flask containing 3 × 10^7 cells.\nMix well and incubate at 37°C and 6% CO2 for 4 hours.\nRemove extracellular bacteria by replacing with fresh pre-warmed antibiotic-free BMDM media.\nMaintain infected macrophages in BMDM medium at 37°C and 6% CO2 for 3 days.\n## Labeling\n## Labeling Solution Preparation\nPre-warm sterile 1% fatty acid-free BSA in PBS at 37°C for 30-60 min.\nAdd 4 mM stock of Bodipy-palmitate to obtain 100 μM concentration.\n## Labeling Procedure\nAdd 1.6 ml of 100 μM Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA to 18.4 ml of pre-warmed cuvette buffer.\nReplace media from infected macrophages with cuvette buffer containing Bodipy-palmitate and incubate at 37°C and 6.0% CO2 for 1 hour.\nRemove the cuvette buffer containing the Bodipy-palmitate and add fresh pre-warmed cuvette buffer without label for 1 hour.\n## Isolation of Intracellular Bacteria\nRemove cuvette buffer from labeled infected cells and quickly rinse with 10 ml of Homogenization buffer.\n## Cell Lysis\nAdd 15 ml of ice-cold Homogenization buffer and incubate at 4°C for 10-15 min.\nHarvest macrophages by scraping off from each flask with cell scrapers and transfer to a 50 ml conical tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm (514 × g) for 10 min.\n## Phagosome Isolation\nResuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of Homogenization buffer and lyse the cells by 25-70 passages through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle.\nIncrease the volume to 5 ml by adding Homogenization buffer and centrifuge the cell lysate at 800 rpm (146 × g) for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant (suspension of phagosomes) into a new 15 ml conical tube.\n## Bacterial Isolation\nAdd 20% Tween 80 to a final concentration of 0.1% and mix well, leaving at 4°C for 15 min to lyse Mtb-containing vacuoles.\nIsolate the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,430 × g) for 15 min.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of 0.05% tyloxapol in PBS and centrifuge bacteria down at 3,300 rpm (2,500 × g) for 15 min.\nFix bacteria in 4% PFA for 24 hours in a 2 ml screw-cap tube.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-2734","Bio-protocol-673","Protocol.io-4775","Bio-protocol-41","Protocol.io-4482","Protocol.io-2389","Protocol.io-2175","Protocol.io-698","Protocol.io-4253","Protocol.io-4434"]}

Preparation of the pre-culture (to be used for all subsequent culture conditions)1.  Streak Xoo strain ΔrpfB from -80~^°C glycerol stock on NA plate supplemented with cephalexin at a final concentration of 20u/m l .2.  Incubate the plate at 28~^°C for 4 days to obtain single colonies.3.  With a pipette tip, isolate one ΔrpfB colony and inoculate in 10 ml of NB supplemented with cephalexin with a final concentration of 20 u/m l in a 50ml Erlenmeyer flask.4.  Incubate the ΔrpfB culture in the M a×Q^T M6000 Incubated/Refrigerated shaker at 28~^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36h .B.  Preparation of Xoo culture1.  Measure the optical density at 600 n m (O D_600) of the 1:4 diluted ΔrpfB pre-culture in a spectrophotometer and calculate the optical density of the pre-culture by multiplying the measured reading by 4 (the dilution ratio).2.  Adjust the O D_600 of the pre-culture to approximately 1.0 using NB.3.  Add 1ml of adjusted ΔrpfB pre-culture to 50~ml nutrient broth (1: 50 dilution) in a 250~m~l~ Erlenmeyer flask with vent cap.4.  Incubate the culture at 28^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36-48 h until it reaches early stationary phase (O D_600approx2.8–3.0) for DSF/BDSF extraction. Note: If other bacterial strains are assayed, other specific growth conditions should be optimized.C.  Extracellular DSF/BDSF extraction1.  Dispense 4ml of the ΔrpfB culture in two 2 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 8,000 xg for 15 min to obtain the culture supernatant for extracellular DSF/BDSF extraction.2.  Transfer the supernatant to two new ^2ml microtubes and adjust its pH to 3.0-3.5 by adding adequate volume (usually 15 to 20ul ) of 6N hydrochloric acid and monitoring pH changes with test strips.3.  Dispense the supernatant in eight 2 ml microtubes ( :0.5ml per tube), and then, add 1 ml of ethyl acetate into each tube.4.  Vortex the microtubes at the highest speed for 5 min to extract DSF and BDSF molecules and centrifuge at 8,000xg for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.5.  Carefully collect the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) into four 1.5~ml microtubes by pipetting and evaporate the solvent in a CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40^°C to complete dryness (approximately 20m i n ).6.  Dispense 0.15ml of methanol in the four 1.5ml microtubes and vortex the microtubes vigorously for 30 sec, which ensures that all residues are re-dissolved.7.  Centrifuge the microtubes at 2,000× g for 1 min, and then transfer the extraction solution from each microtube into a new 1.5~ml microtube using a pipette.8.  Evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40~^°C to complete dryness (approximately 40m i n ). Notes: a.  At this point, the samples may be frozen at -20~^°C for later steps or analyzed immediately as described in the following steps. b.  For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps C3 to C8 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.D.  Intracellular DSF/BDSF extraction1.  Decant 40ml ΔrpfB culture in a 50ml centrifuge tubes and harvest bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000× g for 15min at 4^°C .2.  Discard the supernatant and add 40 mI of 1x PBS buffer in the tube to wash the cell pellets by pipetting gently.3.  Discard the supernatant and harvest the washed bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000xg for 15 min at 4^°C .4.  Re-suspend the cell pellets in 10ml of ice-cold sodium acetate buffer (p H3.8) .5.  Freeze the re-suspension solution in a -20~^°C freezer for 1 h and then incubate the bacterial suspension at room temperature for 30 to 60 min to thaw the suspension completely.6.  Homogenize the cells by pipetting the thawed bacterial suspension gently.7.  Repeat steps D5 and D6 once more.8.  Sonicate the cell homogenate for a total of 6 min by sonicating for 3 sec, pausing for 4 sec, and repeating this sonication/pause cycle120 times (amplitude set at 20% ) on ice using the Vibra cellTMHigh Intensity Ultrasonic Liquid Processors connected with a Tapered Microtip probe (3 mm diameter).9.  Transfer the centrifuge tube containing the processed cell lysate into a water bath for 5 min at 95^°C to denature the total protein.10. Separate the soluble lysis solution with bacterial cell debris by centrifuging at 8,000 x g for 15 min at 4^°C .11. After centrifugation, immediately transfer the soluble lysis solution (the transparent part) to a 250~ml Erlenmeyer glass flask using a pipette. This should be performed carefully to avoid disturbing the precipitate at the bottom of the tube.12. Add _20 ml of ethyl acetate in the flask and close the flask with the cap immediately to avoid evaporation and spillage of the volatile solvent. Incubate the capped flask in the MaxQTM 6000 shaker at 28~^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 10 min to extract DSF and BDSF.13. Transfer the extraction mixture to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 6,000xg for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.14. Transfer the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) to a 100ml pear shaped glass flask by pipetting carefully.15. Remove the solvent by rotary evaporation at 40^°C to complete dryness (approximately 5 min).16. Dispense 1 ml of methanol into the pear shaped glass flask to re-dissolve the residue by pipetting several times.17. Transfer the solution to a 1.5~ml microtube and evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40^°C to complete dryness. Notes: a.  At this point, the samples may be frozen at - -20~^°C for later steps or be analyzed immediately as described in the following steps. b.  For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps D12 to D17 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.# E.  LC/MS sample preparation1.  Crude extraction samples can be obtained by adding 200~ul of methanol into the 1.5~ml microtube and vortex at the highest speed.2.  To remove any insoluble particles in the sample, filter the crude sample through an MS syringe filter (0.2 um) connected with  a  1 ml disposable syringe. Collect the filtered sample (approximately 100ul_,^ ) in a new 1.5ml microtube.3.  Transfer 60ul of filtered sample into a chromatography vial fitted with a flat bottom insert using a pipette. Cap the vials. Samples are now ready for LC/MS analysis.# F.  LC/MS procedure1.  Use HPLC grade methanol (eluent B)-water (eluent A) (80:20, v/v) as mobile phase.2.  Maintain the column temperature at 30~^°C and flow rate at 0.4m l/m i n .3.  Equilibrate the column for 15 min or longer until the baseline is stable.4.  Inject 5~ul aliquots of prepared samples onto an Agilent 1290 Infinity UPLC with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column.5.  Detect DSF and BDSF molecules using a diode array detector (Agilent G4212A) set to a detection wavelength of 220 n m with a band width of 4n m .6.  The sample is then injected into an AJS ESI ion-trap mass spectrometer in negative ionization mode.7.  MS source parameters are as follows:a. Gas temperature: 325^°C b. Drying gas: 8 L min-1 c. Nebulizer: 35 psig d. Sheath gas temperature: 350^°C e. Sheath gas flow: 11 L min-1 f. Capillary voltage (Vcap): 3,500 V g. Nozzle voltage: 200 V h.

At 12~h after infection with VSV, collect blood samples from mouse tail veins by making a cut around 5mm from the tip of the mouse tail using scalpel blade.b.  Allow the whole blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature for 30min .c.  Remove the clot by centrifuging at 1 ,000xg for 10m i n at 4^°C .d.  For measurement of serum interferon-beta levels, use VeriKine- H S^T M mouse IFN beta serum ELISA kit. ELISA is performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.e.  For measurement of serum viral titer, plaque-forming assay is performed. In this assay, 5× 10^6 Vero cells on 6-well plate is infected with virus of serum samples for 1~h~ and overlaid with _2ml of DMEM containing 2.4% methylcellulose and 5% heat inactivated FBS for 24h .

Dilute heparinized blood with an equal volume of 1x PBS at room temperature (RT) and put it down slowly over Histopaque to obtain human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCS).2.  Add ^20mI of Histopaque (warmed to RT) to 50~ml conical tubes. Then slowly overlay 20 ml of the diluted blood mixture on top of the Histopaque. Centrifuge at 535xg for 35 min at room temperature with the brake off.3.  Carefully  remove  the  lymphocyte  interface  (white  ring  between  the  media  and Histopaque) with a sterilized serological pipette and transfer to a new 50~ml conical tube (Figure 1).()(photograph)Figure 1. A schematic representation of the result of the density gradient stratification (modified by dublinlisacoolsaet.wordpress.com)4.  Fill the tube with RT PBS to 50ml and centrifuge at 470xg for 7 min at room temperature with the brake on (acceleration: 5, deceleration: 5).5.  Put off the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet with 4~ml of Erylyse buffer and incubate at RT for 8 min.6.  Fill the tube with PBS to 50~ml and centrifuge at 470 xg for 7 min at RT with the brake on.7.  Resuspend the pellet in 10 m of PBS, count with dead cell exclusion the PBMCs and centrifuge cell suspension at 470xg for 10m i n .8.  Isolate human C D14^+ cells: Use human C D14^+ magnetic microbeads according to the manufacturer’s instructions: a.  Put off the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 80~ul of Running Buffer per 2 ×10^7 total cells in a 50 m l conical tube. b.  Add 20ul of CD14 Microbeads per 2×10^7 total cells. c.  Mix well and incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator (2-8^°C) . d.  Wash cells by adding 1 ml of Running Buffer per 10^7 cells and centrifuge at 470 xg for 10m i n . Put off the supernatant. e.  Re-suspend up to 10^8 cells in 500ul of Running Buffer. f. Proceed to magnetic separation with the autoMACS separator.9.  Collect C D14^+ cells, wash with 10 ml complete medium, resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of complete medium and count with dead cell exclusion. C D14^+ cells should be 10-15% of PBMC (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Analysis of c opm4^+ cells after separation at day 0. A. Histogram: the black peak is the isotype control antibody, the white peak CD 4^+ cells; B. Dot plot.10. Centrifuge at 470 x g for 8 m i n at room temperature with the brake on and put off the supernatant;11. Re-suspend at 5~x~10^6 cells in 3 ml complete medium supplemented with 100 n g/m l of GM-CSF and 50 n g/m l of IL-4 and then culture cells in 6-well plate. Incubate cells at 37 ^° and 5% C O_2 (the cytokines are dissolved in DNase/RNase free water and diluted in complete medium).12. Day 3: Added 2 ml/well of fresh complete medium supplemented with 100 n g/m l of GMCSF and 50ng/ml IL-4.13. Day 6: Monocytes are differentiating into immature dendritic cells, they are in suspension and so be careful when removing the plate from incubator. Take medium with cells out of the 6-well plate into a 50 m l tubes and centrifuge at 210xg for 10m i n at 4^°C . Put off the supernatant and re-suspend cells at 1×10^6c e l l s/m l in complete medium. Collect 1×10^5 cells into FACS tube and add 10~ul PE-anti-CD1a and 10~ul FITC-anti-CD14 antibodies for 20 min at 4^°C and then wash with FACS wash buffer at 470xg for 5 min. Put off the supernatant and re-suspend cells in 200~ul and run samples on CyAn ADP flow cytometer. The percentage of C D1a^+ cells should be higher than 90% as measured by flow cytometer analysis (Figure 3). Immature human derived-DC (iDC) are then ready for experimental  use.  If  iDC  population  is  between 70-90% they  can  be  used  for experiments, while if they are less than 70% , restart culture.()# Figure 3.

Euthanize the mice by injecting 0.5ml of avertin intraperitoneally with a 25 Gauge needle. The mice become unresponsive after 1-2 min. Note:  Verify  the  institution  approved  ethical  regulations  on  animal  welfare  if  other euthanization methods are in place.2.  Check the absence of cerebrospinal reflexes by pinching the paw of the posterior limbs with a forceps.3.  After spraying the animal with 70% ethanol, open the right flank and remove the spleen. Remove any fatty tissue that is connected with the spleen and place the organ in 15~ml tube with 5ml of ice-cold HBSS.4.  Bring the spleen to a 35~m m Petri dish and mince the organ into pieces by using the scissors. To obtain a good dissociation of the tissue, proceed until no pieces are visible with the bare eyes.5.  Add 1 ml of ice-cold RPMI, bring the cell suspension to a 15~ml Falcon tube and put on ice. Complete all other organs before adding the digestion medium.6.  Add 1 ml of 37~^°C preheated 2x digestion medium to the cell suspension and bring all organs to the 37^°C warm water bath. Make sure the shaker is put to its maximum setting. Note: Shaking the sample will allow more efficient digestion of the tissue by decreasing its precipitation.7.  Incubate the cell suspension for 15 min and dissociate the cell suspension by pipetting the solution up and down through a Pasteur pipette.8.  Repeat step 7 once more.9.  Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down cell suspension at 400× g7 min 4^°C .10. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in _2m l of ice-cold osmotic lysis buffer. Incubate for acute4 at room temperature and subsequently add 10 m of ice-cold MACS buffer. Spin down cell suspension at 400× g7m i n4^°C .11. Resuspend cells in 10 m of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100~um cell strainer. One can reuse the 15~ml tube to collect the filtered cells. Take a 20~ul counting sample and spin down rest of cell suspension at 400× g7 min 4^°C .12. Add 180~ul of trypan blue to the 20~ul of counting sample and mix well. Count cells. After digestion, 1 spleen will normally contain up to 60-100×10^6 cells.13. Remove supernatant from cell pellet and resuspend in antibody mix I at a concentration of 50 x 10^6 cells per 1~ml of mix (see table 1). Stain 20 m i n on ice in the dark. Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C .Table 1. Antibody mix I in MACS buffer()14. Remove supernatant from cell pellet and add 90ul of ice-cold MACS buffer per 10×10^6 cells.15. Add 5-10~ul/10×10^6 cells of anti-FITC microbeads. Resuspend and incubate 15 min on ice. Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Discard supernatant.16. Prepare LD columns according to manufacturer’s protocol.17. After preparation, place a 15ml tube on ice under the LD column.18. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100um cell strainer on the LD column. Note: This minimizes the probability of cell clots obstructing the LD column. After the 1 ml of cell suspension has run through, wash 2 times with _2m l of ice-cold MACS buffer. Make sure that cell suspension runs through each time. Discard the column and spin down the effluent (7 min 400× g4^°C) . Aspirate the supernatant.19. Stain cell pellet in 500~ul of antibody mix II. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Add 10 ml of icecold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer. Bring the cell suspension to a 5~ml polystyrene tube with a cell strainer cap to remove possible clots.Table 2. Antibody mix II in PBS()Note: Use of PBS is necessary for optimal staining of dead cells with the Fixable viability dye eFluor 506.20. Single stains are prepared by diluting 1 drop of Ultra comp eBeads in _2m l of PBS. Make sure to shake the beads thoroughly before use as precipitation occurs. Bring 200~ul of this bead suspension to seven 5~ml reaction tubes (6 fluorochromes +1 unstained sample). Antibodies conjugated to bright fluorochomes (PE-eFluor610, Pe-Cy5, AF-647) are diluted 1/2small,000 , other antibodies are diluted 1/400. Stain 15 min on ice in the dark. Add 1~ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in 200ul of PBS. Proceed to the cell sorter.Note: Viability dyes do not bind to the Ultra comp eBeads. Since we exclude dead cells (defined by a positive staining for eFluor 506) there is no need to compensate this fluorochrome. If compensation is preferred, cells can be stained with a 1 in 200 dilution of the eFluor 506 viability dye in PBS. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Wash cells with 1ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400xg4^°C. Resuspend the cells in 200 μl of PBS.21. An example of a gating setup is shown below.()Figure 1.  Gating strategy of splenic DCs. A strict gating strategy in the FSC-H/FSC-A plot allows the exclusion of doublets. The CD1 1b^+ DCs (LinCD11c MHCII CD1 1b^+ cells) contain a fraction of monocyte derived cells (specific infections with pathogens or inflammation can drastically increase this cell population, contaminating the CD1 1b^+ DC gate). The conventional CD1 1b^+ DCs can be identified by exclusion of the D64^+ cells.# Notes1.  One should take in mind to work as fast as possible. Once removed from the live animal splenic DC subsets viability is quickly compromised. Furthermore, working with cold reagents improves overall survival.2.  A good dissociation of the tissue by use of scissor and Pasteur pipettes and adequate incubation of the splenocytes in the digestion medium is crucial for optimal cell retrieval. Whenadjusting the antibody mix, keep in mind that the enzymatic digestion can potentially cleave off surface proteins expressed on the cell types of interest.3.  In optimal conditions, negative selection with the use of MACS beads removes 90-95% of C D3e^+ and C D19^+ cells. This reduces the number of cells to approximate 5-10×10^6 cells and a total sorting time to approximate _20m i n .4.  One can sort 80,000-120,000 CD8a+ DCs and 400,000-600,000 CD11b+ DCs from 1 spleen (in homeostatic conditions). The CD1 1b^+ DCs can be further subdivided by the use of surface markers ESAM or CD4.5.  In the case that the cells are to be cultured, the scientist should keep in mind to work sterile from the moment the spleen is obtained (step 4). Prior to use, the buffers can be filtered to remove potential pathogens using a 0.2um filter.6.  Cells can be brought into culture in R10 medium with the addition of 250n g/m l of recombinant murine Flt3L.

Place mouse with abdomen up on paper towel in hood.4.  Swab abdomen with 70% alcohol or isopropanol.5.  Make a small incision in the center of the skin overlying the peritoneal wall. Note: Small incision is made on the skin to peel the skin off. Injection and extraction can be at different sites on peritoneal membrane.6.  Firmly pull skin to expose the peritoneal wall.7.  Insert the needle to peritoneal membrane; avoid inserting needle into guts or bladder. Inject 5ml of PBS EDTA into peritoneal cavity.8.  Massage abdomen for approximately 10-15 seconds.9.  Withdraw the needle slowly. Change the _25 needle on the syringe to a _20 needle.10. Use one hand to push the fluid to one side of the peritoneum. Using the other hand, insert needle to the side of cavity with plenty of fluid and withdraw the fluid from peritoneum. Avoid fat, gut or mesentery, which may clog the needle. Try to draw as much fluid as possible. Usually, approximately 4-4.5~ml fluid can be recovered from one mouse.11. Remove needle from syringe and dispense contents into a centrifuge tube on ice.12. Centrifuge peritoneal cells (300xg;3m i n) and collect cell pellet. Usually about 2-4 million resident peritoneal cells can be recovered from one C57BL/6 mouse using this method and about 50% are peritoneal macrophages.13. Resuspend cell pellet from one mouse in 1~ml of cRPMI medium, count cells.14. Culture peritoneal cells in a 12-well plate, 2 million/well in 1 ml cRPMI at 37~^°C with 5% C O_2 for 6-18 h . During this time, peritoneal macrophages adhere to the plastic surface. The floating non-macrophages can then be washed away by adding and aspirating 0.5ml cRPMI medium twice.15. The adherent macrophages are ready to use.B.  Harvest  and culture thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages can be harvested and cultured in the same way as described in steps 1-15 with additional steps as shown below.16. Preparation of 3% thioglycollate medium.a.  Heat a 300~ml flask with an aluminum foil lid angle180-200 ^°C in a laboratory oven for at least 18h to get rid of endotoxin. b.  Suspend 6 grams of thioglycollate medium in _200ml of pyrogen-free water. c.  Autoclave (15~psi/121~^°C/15~min) . d.  After cooling, aliquot to 15ml sterile Falcon tubes. Store in a dark place at room temperature for 2 months before using. We have found that thioglycollate medium stored at room temperature for up to 2 years can still be used. 17. Inject 1 ml of aged thioglycollate i.p. per mouse. Wait for 4-5 days, harvest peritoneal cells. About 10 million macrophages can be recovered from one mouse.

However, the same protocol can be applied to other brain regions or after the performance of behavioral paradigms.1.  Kill the mouse by cervical dislocation or decapitation and rapidly immerse the head in liquid nitrogen for 4 sec to rapidly cool down the brain without allowing it to freeze (this step helps for the brain dissection and to better preserve protein phosphorylation). We recommend to euthanize the mouse with physical methods such as cervical dislocation rather than using anesthetics or carbon dioxide, but this step should be adapted to local ethical committee guidelines.2.  Remove the brain, remove the meninges, and dissect the striatum of the 2 hemispheres (approx15-20mg) ) on an ice-cooled glass dish as it is shown in Video 1.# Video 1. Striatum extraction()3.  Homogenize the striata in a glass dounce homogenizer (10 strokes of the loose pestle followed by 10 strokes of the tight pestle) with 1 ml of synaptoneurosome buffer kept on  ice.  The  number  of  strokes  might  vary  depending  on  the  individual homogenizer/pestles and the size of the brain area. All the steps are performed at 4^°C (either on ice or in a 4^°C room). Representative pictures of the homogenates at each step are shown in Figure 1.4.  Transfer the homogenate into an Eppendorf tube and aliquot 100ul as an input.5.  Prepare all the material required for the synaptoneurosome preparation procedure as indicated in Figure 2.6.  Pre-wet 3 Nylon net filters ( 100um pore) in synaptoneurosome buffer on ice.7.  Attach a 5~ml syringe without the plunger (syringe #1) to a swinnex filter holder (#1) containing the 3 pre-wetted Nylon net filters 100um) , as illustrated in Figure 3. Then, attach this swinnex to another 5ml syringe (syringe #2) without the plunger, which has been attached at the dispensing tip end to a swinnex filter holder containing 1 Mitex membrane filter ( 10um pore) (swinnex filter holder #2). Place on the other side of the swinnex #2 a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube on ice to collect the sample.8.  With a 1-ml pipette, load the sample into the end of the barrel of the syringe #1 attached to a swinnex filter holder #1, insert the plunger and push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe.9.  Remove the 5~ml syringe #1 and replace it by a 60 ml syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters angle100 um , push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. This step helps to push down the sample to the barrel of syringe #2.10. Remove the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters ( angle100 um , place the plunger of the 5~ml syringe #2, which is connected to the swinnex filter holder #2 containing 1 Mitex membrane filter (10 um) , and push down until all the air is gone from the syringe.11. Remove the syringe #2 and replace it with a 60~mI syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #2 , push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. At this step, the homogenate should be in the 1.5ml Eppendorf tube placed on ice.12. Centrifuge 1 min at 4,000 x g at 4^°C . Pipette the supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube and discard the pellet. A representative image of how the pellet looks is shown in Figure 1b.13. Centrifuge the supernatant for 4 min at 14,000xg at 4~^°C . Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100~ul synaptoneurosome buffer. A representative image of how the pellet looks is shown in Figure 1c. (The volume to re-suspend the pellet might change depending on the protein concentration desired. From the striata of one mouse the synaptoneurosome preparation obtained has a protein concentration around 1-2ug/ul . The pellet can be stored at -80~^°C until used.# bio-protocolNote: In this type of synaptoneurosome preparation we obtained samples containing enrichment of both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, a substantial reduction of glial markers and absence of nuclear markers (Biever et al., 2015).

Mating procedure consists of housing 2 females with one male for 15 d. The experimental procedure requires that, at least 5 females give birth simultaneously, within 24 h. To reach this goal and synchronize females’ estrous cycles, females can be exposed to male odor a few days before mating. Check female weight at mating.2.  On the 15th day, males are removed and females are weighed to assess pregnant status. The weight gained, suggesting pregnancy, depends on the strain of mice used, but generally is between 10 and 15 grams in 15 days (a 50% increase of weight from mating day); in addition visible lateral \"bulges\" are visible in pregnant females.3.  Each pregnant female is isolated in a clean cage with bedding material (paper) and daily checked for pups’ birth (PND0: postnatal day 0).4.  At least 5 females should give birth within ^24~h~ to permit the execution of RCF manipulation.# Rcf manipulationPups spend the first postnatal day (PND0) with the biological mother. Differently from the ‘‘classical’’ cross-fostering procedures (Bartolomucci et al., 2004), RCF pups change caregiver every ^24~h~ for 4 times during the PND1-PND4 time interval, by following a rotation scheme: Each dam receives 4 different litters during this manipulation and each litter changes 4 different adoptive dams (the adoptive dam is the mum who receive pups from another mum) (also see Figure 2 and the Table 1). The daily procedure consists of first removing the mother from the cage, then removing its entire litter, and immediately introducing this litter into the home-cage of a different dam whose pups had just been removed. The RCF pups were then semi-covered with the home-cage bedding of the adoptive mother, which is then reintroduced in the cage and left with this litter for the next24 h. The entire procedure lasted about 30 sec and took place every day at same time during the light cycle of a standard light/dark cycle (usually between 10.30 and 11.00 a.m.). This was repeated daily, four times until reaching the fourth adoptive mother, with which pups were left until weaning (PND 28).Adoptive dams should be lactating females with pups of the same age as fostered litters and litters should have same or at least similar number of pups to avoid possible nutritional stress for mothers and pups.The control manipulation consists in first removing the mother from the cage, then picking up control pups, reintroducing them in their home-cage and covering with home-cage bedding. At the end of this manipulation, which lasts 30 sec, the biological mother is reintroduced in the home cage. This control procedure takes place daily from PND1 to PND4, to assess possible effects of the handling procedure necessarily required by RCF protocol. It is not necessary that control females give birth exactly on the same day.# Procedure step by stepFor example, we consider 5 litters RCF and one CONTROL. We identify RCF mums with uppercase letters A, B, C, D and E, and respective pups with the same but lowercase letters a, b. c, d, and e. The control mum identification is F and respective pups f. To facilitate the procedure we record mum’s code on the home cage tag while the pups’ code is written on a smaller removable tag that can be transferred (together with pups) to the adoptive mother’s home-cage tag.First day (PND1)1.   Remove mum “A” from its home cage.2.  Remove pups “a” from the home cage and put them in a clean cage on hot plate (30-35^°C) to maintain body temperature.3.   Remove mum “B” from its home cage.4.   Move pups “b” from their home cage to the mum’s “A” cage, semi-cover pups with bedding and reintroduce mum “A” in its home cage.5.   Remove mum ^C^,, from its home cage.6.   Move pups “c” from their home cage to the mum’s “B” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “B” in its home cage.7.   Remove mum “D” from its home cage.8.   Move pups “d” from their home cage to the mum’s “C” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum ^*C\" in its home cage.9.   Remove mum “E” from its home cage.10.  Move pups “e” from their home cage to the mum’s “D” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “D” in its home cage.11.  Put pups “a” in the mum’s “E” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “E” in its home   cage.The following days (PND 2,3,4) the procedure always starts from the mum “A”.The control manipulation consists in first removing the mother “F” from the cage, than picking up pups “f” and reintroducing them in their home-cage and covering with home-cage bedding. At the end of this manipulation, which lasts 30 sec, the biological mother “F” is reintroduced in the home cage. This manipulation is repeated for the PND1, PND2, PND3 and PND4.Home cage bedding was changed on postnatal day 10.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Mating Procedure\nHouse 2 females with one male for 15 days.\nExpose females to male odor a few days before mating to synchronize estrous cycles.\nCheck female weight at mating.\n## Pregnancy Assessment\nRemove males on the 15th day and weigh females to assess pregnant status.\nCheck for visible lateral 'bulges' in pregnant females.\nVerify weight gain, typically between 10 and 15 grams in 15 days.\n## Isolation and Birth Monitoring\nIsolate each pregnant female in a clean cage with bedding material.\nCheck daily for pups' birth (PND0).\n## RCF Manipulation Preparation\nEnsure at least 5 females give birth within 24 hours.\nPrepare adoptive dams with pups of the same age as fostered litters.\n## RCF Manipulation\n## PND0-PND4 Procedure\nRemove the mother from the cage.\nRemove the entire litter and introduce it into the home-cage of a different dam.\nSemi-cover the litter with the home-cage bedding of the adoptive mother and reintroduce the adoptive mother.\n## Rotation Scheme\nEach dam receives 4 different litters during the PND1-PND4 time interval.\nEach litter changes 4 different adoptive dams.\n## Control Manipulation\nRemove the mother from the cage.\nPick up control pups, reintroduce them into their home-cage, and cover with home-cage bedding.\nReintroduce the biological mother.\n## Step-by-Step Procedure Example\n## First Day (PND1)\nRemove mum 'A' from its home cage.\nRemove pups 'a' from the home cage and put them in a clean cage on a hot plate.\nMove pups 'b' from their home cage to the mum's 'A' cage.\nRepeat the process for mums 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'.\n## Following Days (PND2-4)\nRepeat the procedure starting from mum 'A'.\n## Home Cage Maintenance\nChange home cage bedding on postnatal day 10.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-1969","Bio-protocol-1734","Protocol.io-8449","Bio-protocol-3920","Protocol.io-7027","Bio-protocol-85","Bio-protocol-1480","Protocol.io-5116","Protocol.io-7077","Bio-protocol-1865"]}

Subjects\n\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with European guidelines for care of laboratory animals (2010/63/EU) and received approval from the Lyon 1 University Ethics Committee (permission DR2015-46). Adult male Long-Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories) aged 7-8 weeks (300-350 g) at the start of the water deprivation protocol, are housed in groups of 2-4 per cage and kept in an environment with controlled temperature and humidity under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with food ad libitum. Experiments are conducted during the light period.\n\nNote: So far these experiments have not been conducted with other strains of rats or mice, but we assume that usage of other strains shouldn’t introduce major difficulties to carry out the experiments. Nevertheless, according to the fact that contexts are characterized  by  visual  stimulation,  working  with  albinos  rats  might  be  more challenging. Regarding mice, some adjustments to the experimental device would be required.\n\n# 2.  Odorants\n\nIn order to be delivered in a fully controlled manner through a new generation of olfactometer (Sezille et al., 2013), each odorant is introduced in a U-shaped Pyrex® tube (volume: 10 m ; length: 50~m m ; external diameter: 14~m m ) (VS technologies) filled with microporous granules. All odors used in these experiments were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, France (see a-f below).\n\na.  Geraniol (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 163333) 20% of saturated vapor pressure\nb.  Eugenol (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: E51791) 18% of saturated vapor pressure\nc.  (S)- (+) -Carvon (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 435759) 35% of saturated vapor pressure = Odor A\nd.  Isoamylacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: W205508) 15% of saturated vapor pressure = Odor B\ne.

Citral (cis ^+ trans) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: W230308) 20% of saturated vapor pressure = Odor D\n\nNote: Before the start of experiments, between 2 and 4 ml of pure odor solution are introduced gradually on several consecutive days into the U Shaped Glass Tubes until the microporous granules appear saturated (Figure 1) (for the experiments, the odors should be at saturated vapor pressure in the tube, at the same time in order to prevent olfactometer pollution it is important to avoid the accumulation of liquid at the bottom of the tube). The percentage of saturated vapor pressure introduced into the airflow is adjusted for each odor individually by the experimenter. The objective is to obtain an intensity that is perceived by the animal but moderate enough to prevent any avoidance behavior. For the different odors used in pairs, we also try to equalize their perceived intensity. The choice of these particular odors and concentrations was mainly determined by previous experiments in  the  lab  showing  their  easy  discriminability  and  the  absence  of  their  natural attractiveness or repulsiveness to the rats at the concentrations used (Martin et al., 2004; Courtiol et al., 2014; Torquet et al., 2014).\n\n()\nFigure 1.

Drinking solutions\n\na. 6% Sucrose in solution is used as positive reinforcement (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: number: 84097)\nb. 0.06% Quinine  hydrochloride  dehydrate  in  solution  is  used  as  negative reinforcement (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: Q1125)\n\n# Equipment\n\n1.  Apparatus (EPISODICAGE)\n\nThe experimental cage is a PVC rectangular box ( 60×35×40cm ) equipped with 4 devices for delivery of different odor and drinking solutions (Figure 2A) (Belkacem Messaoudi). On the two opposing walls, at 5 cm distance from each corner of the box, the cage contains an arrangement of odor and drinking ports. The odor port is a round indentation into the wall angle5×5 cm in size), with a drinking port (small hole, 1×1 cm in size) placed 1cm below the odor port through which a drinking pipette can be inserted into the cage (Figure 1B).\n\n()\n\nFigure 2. The EPISODICAGE. A. General view of the experimental cage showing the four cameras installed above each of the four odor ports. B. Details of an odor port (OP) with associated drinking pipette (P), view from the inside (left figure) or the outside (right figure) of the cage: odor injection (OI) and odor extraction (OE), motor (M), which allows introducing and withdrawing the pipette from the cage. C. Each nose poke first triggers an odor delivery for 13 sec. Three seconds after odor initiation, a pipette containing various drinking solutions (water, sugar or quinine) is introduced into the cage for 10 sec until the odor stimulation switches off. Each lick on the pipette made by the rat is detected and recorded by the computer devoted to the control of the experimental cage. Each trial starts with the nose poke and ends with withdrawal of the pipette and odor switch off. D. On the left, appearance of the cage in the version used in routine sessions. The two other pictures illustrate how the appearance of the cage can be modified by projecting visual patterns on the ground (center picture) or introducing objects (right picture). Figure adapted from Veyrac et al. (2015).\n\n# a. Odor port\n\nWhen a rat makes a nose poke into the port, a capacitance change is detected by the system that immediately triggers for 13 sec the introduction of odor-saturated vapor into a constant airflow (air flow overall: 1 liter/min). The proportion of odorized air and the quality of the odorant are controlled through a custom made olfactometer connected to the odor port (OI) (Figure 1B). In a given experimental session, five different odors can be delivered at each of the four odor ports. A venturi-based system of aspiration allows extraction of the odorized air through a separate channel, so that the odor remains limited to the port (OE) (Figure 1B). A permanent compensation of OI and OE prevents any change in overall air pressure due to odor switch.\n\nNote: Rats are highly sensitive to changes in air pressure. To prevent any behavioral response to mechanical stimulation, air pressure must be kept at the same level during the presence and absence of odors.\n\nb.  Drinking port\n\nEach movable drinking pipette is connected to a pump. The pipette is introduced into the cage 3 sec after the first nose poke of the animal and is withdrawn from the cage 10 sec later simultaneously with termination of odor release (Figure 1C). This ensures that the odor stimulation is delivered during the entire liquid consumption. A second capacitance change sensor integrated into the drinking pipette detects every single lick of the animal and triggers the pump which in turn delivers a calibrated amount of 89~ul of drinking solution. The licks made by the rats are recorded as text files for later analysis of the results.\n\nNote: The amount of liquid delivered upon each lick from the drinking ports must be equal between the ports (the variation should be within 8pm1~mu l) , in order to avoid any preference of the animals for a particular port.\n\nDifferent drinking solutions can be delivered by the system, water, sucrose or quinine solutions according to the different phases of the protocol and the odor-port configurations. After each trial and retraction of the pipette, the drinking solution device is purged with the solution of the following trial.\n\nNote: Purge duration is set in a way that allows the complete wash out of the drinking solution of the last trial. This was verified through addition of ink into the water before the start of experiments.\n\n2.  Items for contextual enrichment during episodes\n\nAcoustic context\n\nDifferent types of sounds can be played through two loudspeakers symmetrically placed above the experimental arena to enhance the discriminability of the episodes: nature sounds, bird songs, piano music …etc. The general guideline for choosing these sounds was their discriminability as validated in spectrograms and the animals/experimenter’s well-being.\n\nTactile and visual context\n\nDifferent types of floors can be used with distinct tactile and visual characteristics (Figure 1D). As color vision in rats is poor, combinations of high-contrast black and white coloring of materials are preferred. Additionally, visual patterns can also be displayed on the floor by a video projector and various objects can be placed into the box.\n\n# 3.  Video recording\n\nFive cameras are used to monitor precisely the behavior of the rats, one placed centrally above the experimental box and four others each placed above the four odor ports. The position of the rat is detected online via a video tracking software from the signal recorded from the central camera. When the animal approaches a port, the corresponding camera is selected for signal acquisition. This allows us to save space occupied by the video files.\n\n# Software\n\n1.  VOLCAN (Marc Thevenet)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nAll the essential steps of the protocol are summarized in Figure 3. Prior to the start of the shaping procedures, rats are habituated to the experimenter and water deprivation is established.A.  Water deprivation protocolDuring the experiments, and most critically during the shaping period, the animals have to be motivated enough to activate the drinking device. This requires a controlled reduction of their access to water in the animal housing facility. It must not be too severe to preserve the animal in a good physiological state, but sufficient enough to keep them motivated in a controlled and stable way. One week after their arrival in the animal facility, when the animals are habituated to their new housing environment, we quantify daily ad lib water consumption for each individual cage by measuring the bottle weight before and after drinking. Water restriction is introduced progressively one week later: during the first 2 d of deprivation, a drinking pipette is accessible in their home cage for ^2~h~ in the morning (between 9 and 11 am) and in the evening (4 to 6 pm) respectively, then the access is reduced to 1h during the next 2 d and to 40 min during the following 7 d. All along this period, we control that the total amount of water consumed is close to the previous consumption during the ad lib period and consequently adjust the duration of the evening access. Additionally, the weight of the animals is periodically checked to ensure that it remains steady (pm5%) across the entire protocol. During behavioral experiments, if rats are tested in the morning, they receive water for 20-40 min only in the evening, but if they are tested in the afternoon, they receive water during 5 min in the morning and for 20-40 min in the evening. Moreover, evening access to water may be adjusted all along the experiments depending on the amount of water consumed by the animals in the experimental arena.Note: Within a 20 min period, rats are expected to perform at least 10 trials. For animals that do not perform the expected number of trials, and do not exhibit other signs than a lack of motivation, the access time to drinking water is reduced (e.g., from 40 to 20 min). Additionally, it is helpful to decrease the amount of drinking time on the day which precedes the first episode to increase the motivation of the rats and overcome stress which arises through exposure to a novel situation.Water consumption of the animals when water restriction has been established is estimated to around 20~m1/d . Upon water or sugar delivery, the rats make approximately 60 licks per trial, drinking 8~ul solution per lick, thus consuming around 10 ml in 20 trials. The time of free water access in the evening during the experimental period can therefore be adjusted in such a way that rats can consume at least 10-15 ml when the bottle is accessible for drinking.For the long-term test performed 24 days after the last episode presentation, water deprivation is interrupted at the end of the episode presentations and reinstalled one week prior to the test. It should also be slightly stricter than during exposure to the episodes, because by that time the rats spontaneously decrease their water consumption.# B.  ShapingNote: Because the time during which rats are exposed to the episodes is relatively limited, it is essential to minimize stress as much as possible in order to maximize behavioral exploration during episodes. Additionally, during shaping the protocol is adapted to each individual rat in order to start the episodic phase with a relatively homogenous group of rats in terms of their behavioral exploration.Habituation to the experimenterOne week after arrival of the rats the experimenter starts handling and playing with the rats for 5 min twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), first in the animal facility and later in the experimental room, which continues for 2-3 weeks until the start of the experiment. Handling should also be done for one week before the long-term test to ensure that the rats get used again to the experimenter (this time only in the animal facility).Note: Preferably the same person should carry out the experiments, since it is an episodic memory task and the experimenters might be associated to the context of the episode by the animals. If several experimenters are doing the experiments, one should then pay attention that the same experimenter is performing the episode session and corresponding test (e.g., Episode E1 and Test in the context Etau ).()Figure 3. The different phases of the protocol. A. Shaping: Rats are submitted to 11 sessions (1 per day) to habituate them to the cage and the pipette operating system (a nose poke into any of the four odor ports triggers, after a delay, a pipette delivering water (Apparatus shaping, 7 d). During a second phase of shaping, rats are also habituated to receive odor stimulations associated with sugar or quinine from the pipettes (Odors shaping, 4 d). Once shaping is completed, rats undergo 3 routine sessions (R, 1 session a day) with no odor, no enriched context, and only water available from the 4 ports. B. Episodes exposure: During each of these sessions (1 per day) the animals are exposed to 2 distinct episodes left, Episode 1 (E1) configuration; right, Episode 2 (E2) configuration with a 1 d routine (R) session in between, or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Episodes are presented once or twice in independent groups of rats. They were each characterized by a unique combination of odor-place-context associations rewarded with sugar solution (S): odor A at port 2 for E1; odor C at port 4 for E2, while the 3 other incorrect odor-place associations were associated with quinine solution (Q): odor B at port 2 and odors A and B at port 3 for E1; Odor D at port 4 and odors C and D at port 1 for E2. During episode exposures, in a given context (“in which context”), rats encoded at which port location (“where”), one of the odors (“what”) was associated with sugar solution. This configuration is referred to as P+O+ . C and D. Episodic memory tests. During the retrieval test ^24h or 24 days after the last episode session, rats are placed again in one of the context (E2, in this case) to evaluate what type of information they are able to recollect. The 2-port test (C) completely matches the episode in terms of context, odors and locations, except that only water (W) is delivered whatever place-odor configuration is experienced. The challenging 4-port test (D) is a more complex situation since it takes place in the context of E2, but with 4 accessible ports 2 previously associated with context E2 (“In context”, IC, in pink) and 2 associated with context E1 (“out of context”, OC, in blue). Each port is associated with a pair of odors that correspond to their respective episode.Shaping consists of two phases completed in an average of 11 daily sessions lasting 20 min at maximum. During this period, the appearance of the cage is relatively neutral (see Figure 3A): The floor is black and smooth and no odors, sounds or visual stimulation are used.1.  Phase 1 (apparatus shaping)The objective of this phase (5-7 d) is to teach the animal how to access water in the experimental environment. It includes several steps described in details below:Step 1: Rats housed in the same home cage are placed together into the experimental arena for 15 min with pipettes from all ports already introduced into the arena and ready to deliver water upon licking. This collective exploration period considerably reduces stress and facilitates the discovery of how to operate the drinking pipettes. This session is repeated the next day with the difference that rats are now placed into the experimental arena individually for 15 min. Once a rat licks from the pipette, we proceed to step B2, otherwise we repeat step B1.Step 2: At this stage, rats need to learn to trigger the introduction of the pipette into the cage by making a nose poke to the odor port. Odor ports are made as indentations into the walls of the cage, and the rats naturally come to explore them. At this stage the each pipette becomes accessible for drinking immediately after a nose-poke to the odor port and remains available for drinking for 20 sec. After this the pipette is automatically withdrawn from the cage and has to be triggered by the rat again after a refractory period (purge, duration: a few sec) which is set by the experimenter.Note: It is better to choose a short refractory period at the beginning of shaping procedures (e.g., 5 sec) in order to accelerate learning of the link between the nose-poke and the pipette accessibility. For the same reason, it is important for the pipettes to be accessible for a sufficient amount of time (20 sec) to be discovered by the rats. Indeed during this period, rats usually do not wait at a particular port, but are moving around from port to port. Once they have understood how to trigger the pipettes, the amount of time during which the pipettes are accessible is reduced to 10 sec for the following session. If at this stage a rat still does not know how to trigger the pipette, this step can be repeated. This learning unit is acquired once rats perform 10-20 trials (pipette triggering) in 20 min.Step 3: A 3 sec offset between nose-poke and pipette entry into the cage is introduced at this stage to habituate the rats to wait for the pipette in front of the port. 10-20 trials should be initiated by the rats in a 20 min session.Any of the 3 steps can be repeated for individual rats depending on their performance. 2.  Phase 2 (odor shaping)The objective of this phase is to habituate the animals to receive odor stimulations after the nose poke and use it as an indication for the nature of the drinking solution that will be delivered a few seconds later. During this phase, two different odors are used: Eugenol and Geraniol. Hereby, geraniol is always associated with sugar solution, while eugenol is always announcing the distribution of a bitter quinine solution. For a given trial, the same odor-solution combination is delivered in the four ports present in the experimental arena. Each daily session consisted of 15 to a maximum of 24 trials initiated by the rats in _20min . The session consists of a sequence of pseudo-randomly distributed geraniol and eugenol trials and is repeated on four consecutive days. The 3 sec delay between a nose-poke coupled with odor release and delivery of the pipette gives the animal some time to process the odor without being distracted by the pipette moving into the cage. Geraniol and eugenol are used uniquely in this shaping procedure.During this phase, the rats progressively learn that the odor coming from the odor port can be predictive of a positive or negative reward. As a consequence, their behavioral response is modified and they begin to avoid licking the quinine solution on the basis of eugenol cue. Depending on the rat, the odor shaping phase will take from 3 to a maximum of 4 d before such behavioral change is observed.Note: The first three trials of every shaping session are always positively reinforced in order to ensure that the animal receives sugar before quinine drinking solution and remains motivated throughout the session.# C.  Episodic task1.  Routine (Figure 3A)Prior to exposure to the episodes, rats undergo routine sessions for 3 consecutive days, with one session per day (Figure 3A). Each session consists of 12-24 trials performed in the same condition as step 3 of phase 1 of shaping. Routine sessions are thus characterized by a contextual environment with which rats are already familiar from shaping procedures (smooth black floor, no specific acoustic and visual ambiance), without any odors being released from the odor ports and with water as the only drinking solution. The objectives of the routine sessions are: First, to verify that there is an even licking distribution among the ports without any preference for a particular place; second, to further monitor and adjust water deprivation (especially when there is a delay between the shaping and the experimental phase due to e.g., some surgical procedures); and finally, to increase the memorability of the following episodes, by contrasting them to accustomed and highly familiar routine sessions.2.  Episodes (Figure 3B)Three essential characteristics distinguish episodes from routine sessions:a.  The context: The simple black and smooth floor of the cage used during shaping and routine sessions is replaced by various materials specific to each episode. Distinct visual patterns are displayed on the floor of the arena by a projector to increase discrepancy between different episodes. Acoustic ambiance is enriched through the playing of natural sounds or music through the loudspeakers. For example, Episode 1 is characterized by a smooth white floor, projection of whitetriangles on a dark background and sounds of crickets. Episode 2 is characterized by a granular white floor, projection of white background with black circles and sounds of birds singing in the rain.b.  Only two of the four ports of the cage can be activated by the rat in each episode, ports 2 and 3 for E1, and ports 4 and 1 for E2 (Figure 3). When a rat makes a nose poke to any of the two remaining non-active ports, nothing happens.c.  On the active ports of a given episode two novel odors are delivered. For simplicity, odor A and B in Episode 1 and odors C and D in Episode 2. As a consequence, in each episode, four different combinations of odor-place can be encountered. Among these possibilities, only one odor-place combination is rewarded with sugar solution whereas the three others are associated with quinine. For example, in E1, sugar will be delivered when odor A is presented in port 2 (referred to as P+O+ , positively reinforced place and odor). When odor B is presented on the same port, the animal will receive quinine (combination referred to as P+O- ). The two other combinations involving port 3 will also lead to quinine: Odor A on port 3 is referred as P-O+ and odor B on the same port as P-O-.Each episode session consists of 12-24 trials and lasts 20-40 min. As during the routine session, the animal is free to explore the environment. Consequently, the number of trials can vary depending on the exploratory motivation of the rat. The odors are presented at the assigned ports in a pseudorandom sequence with three repetitions of the same odor-port configurations every 12 trials. Episode sessions are separated by either one routine session (R) or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Depending on the experiments, each episode can be repeated once before the retention test, when more homogenous performance of the group is needed (e.g., when the effect of a drug is tested on episodic memory performance).To summarize:()Episode 1. Odor A (sigma+) is associated with a sugar drinking solution at port 2 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 3 (P-O+) . Odor B (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 2 (P+O-) and port 3 (P-O-).Episode 2. Odor C (0+) is associated with sugar drinking solution at port 4 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 1 (P-O+) . Odor D (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 4 (P+O-) and port 1 (P-O-).# 3.  Memory recall test (Figure 3C or 2D)The test can be performed ^24~h~ or 24 days after the last exposure to Episode 2 to probe recent or remote long-term memory, respectively. In both tests, quinine and sugar are replaced by water and performance of the rats is estimated by taking into account only the 12 first trials of the test. Two versions of the test that differ in their levels of difficulty can be carried out.2-Port Test: The test situation matches completely Episode 2 (Figure 3C). The same contextual environment as during the episode exposure is present. The same two ports are accessible and deliver the same two odors as during the corresponding episode (odors C and D, at ports 1 and 4).4-Port Test: The test takes place in the context corresponding to Episode 2 (same visual, auditory and tactile information), but this time all 4 ports are accessible for drinking, each delivering the same odors as during the corresponding episodes (Figure 3D). As during exposure to episode 2, ports 1 and 4 are releasing odors C and D and are therefore referred to as “In context” (IC) combinations, additionally ports 2 and 3 are releasing odors A and B, as during exposure to episode 1 and are referred to as “out of context” (OC) combinations.Note: One modification introduced to the original protocol is the removal of the routine sessions between the episodes. Instead of routine sessions the rats are kept in their home cages on the same water deprivation schedule as used before the shaping procedures ( 3O min access to water in the morning and evening). We didn’t notice a difference in performance between the two protocols (with either a routine session between the episodes, or one day rest in the home cage with maintained water deprivation) and recommend therefore the simpler version of the protocol which doesn’t include routine sessions between the episodes.Note: The level of difficulty of both tests can be additionally adjusted by using more overlapping or distinct contextual features, such as e.g. the flooring material of the experimental cage, or the chemical proximity of the odors.# AnalysisThe output files of the experiments contain the data about the total amount of licks done for each odor-port configuration on every single trial.1.  To normalize the measures of licking behavior across rats, the licks of all the trials that correspond to a specific odor-port configuration (e.g. P+O+ ) are summed up for a given rat and divided by the total amount of licks made by this rat in the respective session (lick ratio).2.  The group performance is determined by calculating the group mean of the ratios (calculated for each individual rat in step B1) by odor-port configuration, which is referred to as the licks index.3.  The same calculations can be performed by analyzing the number of times rats encountered each of the different odor-port configurations (referred to as visits). For this, trials performed on a given odor-port configuration are summed up and divided by all the trials made in a session for each individual rat, from which the group mean performance is calculated.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Water Deprivation Protocol\nHabituate rats to the experimenter and establish water deprivation.\nQuantify daily ad lib water consumption for each individual cage.\n## Introduce Water Restriction\nRestrict access to water for 2 hours in the morning and evening for the first 2 days.\nReduce access to 1 hour for the next 2 days and 40 minutes for the following 7 days.\nAdjust evening access based on water consumption during experiments.\nMonitor animal weight to ensure it remains steady across the protocol.\n## Shaping\n## Habituation to the Experimenter\nHandle and play with rats for 5 minutes, twice a day, for 2-3 weeks.\nRepeat handling for one week before the long-term test.\n## Apparatus Shaping\n## Step 1: Collective Exploration\nPlace rats in the experimental arena with pipettes for 15 minutes.\nRepeat with individual rats the next day.\n## Step 2: Learn to Trigger Pipettes\nMake pipettes accessible after a nose-poke to the odor port.\nReduce pipette accessibility time to 10 seconds once rats understand the link.\n## Step 3: Introduce Offset\nAdd a 3-second delay between nose-poke and pipette entry.\nEnsure rats perform 10-20 trials in 20 minutes.\n## Odor Shaping\nHabituate rats to odor stimulations associated with sugar or quinine.\nUse geraniol for sugar and eugenol for quinine, with a 3-second delay before pipette delivery.\nRepeat for 3-4 days until rats show behavioral change based on odor cues.\n## Episodic Task\n## Routine Sessions\nConduct 3 consecutive days of routine sessions without odors or enriched context.\nMonitor licking distribution and adjust water deprivation as needed.\n## Episodes\nPresent episodes with distinct context, odors, and rewards.\nUse different materials, visual patterns, and acoustic ambiance for each episode.\nLimit accessible ports and associate specific odors with sugar or quinine.\n## Memory Recall Test\n## 2-Port Test\nMatch the test situation to Episode 2, with the same context and odors.\nDeliver water instead of quinine or sugar, and estimate performance based on the first 12 trials.\n## 4-Port Test\nConduct the test in the context of Episode 2, but with all 4 ports accessible.\nDeliver the same odors as during the corresponding episodes, and estimate performance based on the first 12 trials.\n## Analysis\nNormalize licking behavior across rats by calculating the lick ratio for each odor-port configuration.\nDetermine group performance by calculating the group mean of the lick ratios.\nOptionally, analyze the number of visits to each odor-port configuration instead of licks.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-1740","Protocol.io-754","Bio-protocol-3581","Protocol-exchange-594","Bio-protocol-3980","Protocol-exchange-852","Bio-protocol-3582","Bio-protocol-2889","Protocol.io-8106","Protocol-exchange-706"]}

Preparation for surgery (time 30-45 min)1  Pull the Drummond glass pipette using the Sutter pipette puller and then by stroking the tip on a Kimwipe break the tip back to a tip diameter between 20-40 um (see Figure 1).2  Connect the solenoid pulser to the air pressure regulator with polyurethane tubing; connect the wall-mounted ball valve delivering air with polyethylene tubing (Figure 2).3  Backfill the glass pipette with virus solution ^2 ul per mouse). Secure the pipette tip to the stereotaxic holder arm, and then connect the pipette using PVC tubing to a syringe attached to a 3-way stopcock valve. Put a drop of a virus solution (at least 2~ul per mouse) on a clean surface covered with paraffin to avoid breaking the pipette tip. Move the stereotaxic holder arm to touch the pipette tip to the drop of virus solution and then pull on the syringe to slowly apply negative pressure and fill the pipette with virus solution. Keep the pipette with the virus solution in a closed box, with wet paper towels in the bottom to maintain humidity, until you are ready to inject. Any surfaces in contact with the virus should be cleaned with 10% bleach solution.()Figure 1. Images of the glass pipette used for the intracranial injection of the virus solution. Left, image of the pipette used for the AAV injection (graduated every 1~ul ; maximum 10ul) ). Right, photomicrograph of the pipette tip ( 33um diameter).()Figure 2. Schematic of the setup using a solenoid valve to deliver time-controlled pulses of compressed air for the administration for the virus through a glass pipetteB.  Surgery and virus injection (time 20-30 min)1.  Administer a subcutaneous injection in the neck of caprofen (5 m g/k g) pre-operatively for preemptive analgesia and for its anti-inflammatory actions.2.  Anesthetize the mouse with a solution containing ketamine (100m g/k g) and xylazine (10  m g/ k g) . If the mouse weighs less than 20 , administer half the dose. Administer the drugs via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at volumes of 10ml/kg .3.  Shave the scalp with the hair clipper.4.  Apply Puralube VET ointment to the eyes.5.  Place the mouse on a heating pad (37^°C) , secure the nose in the mouth bar and nose clamp and stabilize the head using the ear bars.6.  Clean the skin above the skull, first with betadine and then with alcohol.7.  Apply lidocaine solution using a Q-tip.8.  Using a scalpel blade, make an incision and push the skin covering the skull to the side.9.  Attach a piece of metal tubing to the stereotaxic probe holder and mark the skull using coordinates targeting the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For mice weighing more than 25 use the following coordinates: anterior-posterior (AP) - 3.4m m and lateral (L) -/+ 0.5 mm relative to bregma, and dorsoventral (D V)4.5m m from the dura. Adjust the coordinates to A P-3.0 mm and D V-4.1 m m for mice weighing between 12 and 16 , and to A .P-3.3m m and D V-4.3m m for mice weighing between 17 and 24 9 . Do not use the glass pipette to mark the coordinates on the skull, since the tip can easily break.10. Drill holes on both sides and clean the exposed skull with saline.11. Place the glass pipette with the virus solution in the probe holder of the stereotaxic apparatus and connect the pipette to the solenoid valve using PVC tubing (see schematic in Figure 1). Before lowering the pipette into the brain, make sure that the timed solenoid-controlled pulses of compressed air are efficiently ejecting the virus solution. If the virus solution is not coming out, gently clean the pipette tip using a Kimwipe saturated with saline.12. Gently pierce the dura with a needle before lowering the pipette.13. Slowly (approximately 0.2 mm per sec) lower the pipette to the target depth + 0.1 m m . Then raise the pipette 0.1m m to the target depth (4.3m m) ). This creates a pocket for the viral solution and reduces needed pressure when delivering the virus solution. Inject 1~ul of the virus solution per side using timed solenoid-controlled pulses of compressed air.14. Leave the pipette in place for 3 min after the injection to reduce back flux along the injection track, and then withdraw it.15. After both injections, clean the skull with saline, push the skin together with a forceps, and close the scalp incision with Vetbond, allow it to cure (1 min), and then apply Neosporin ointment. Then, remove the animal from the stereotaxic apparatus.16. Administer Carprofen daily for 3 days to alleviate pain.# Part II: Determining efficacy and selectivity of the ChR2 expression in dopamine neurons using immunofluorescenceViral transfection delivers multiple copies of ChR2 and induces strong expression. However, ChR2 expression varies among animals so the specificity and efficacy of the transfection needs to be determined and taken into account when determining a functional connectome. Visualization of immunostaining of brains sections for the EYFP tag enables tracing dopaminergic projections, assessing their dopaminergic status and by guiding recordings provides a comprehensive basis for systematic recordings.# Materials and Reagents1 Multi-well plates (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1219C16)2 Petri dishes (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1182N84)3  Coverslips (e.g., Corning, catalog number: 2980-245)4 Microscope slides coated (e.g., Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1178T40)5 Ketamine HCl (KetaVed, Vedco)6 Xylazine (Akorn, AnaSed®)7 Heparin (Swiss Vault Engine, catalog number: 25021-400-66)8 Phosphate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: P3619)9  Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: D5652)10 Glycine (molecular weight: 75.07) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 410225)11 Normal donkey serum (EMD Millipore, catalog number: S30-100mL)12 Triton (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: X100)13 Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against green fluorescence protein (GFP) (EMD Millipore, catalog number: AB3080), which recognizes enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP)14 Mouse monoclonal antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (EMD Millipore, catalog number: MAB318), which recognizes a specific marker of dopamine neurons15 Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, catalog number: A-21206)16 Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 594 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, catalog number: A-21203)17 Prolong Gold mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Molecular ProbesTM, catalog number: P36930)18 Paraformaldehyde (PFA, 16% ) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, catalog number: 15710)19 Glycerol (molecular weight: 92.09) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: G5516)20 Ethylene glycol (molecular weight: 62.07) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 324558)21 Tris HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: T2413)# Equipment1 Brush (small paint brush)2 Vibrating microtome (Leica Biosystems Nussloch, model: VT1200S)3 Laboratory shaker (Benchmark Scientific, model: BlotBoy)4 Slide storage boxes (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1202N78)5 Confocal scanning microscope (Olympus, model: Fluoview FV1000)# Software1.

Brain fixation and slicing (1 day)1  After 3-5 weeks post injection, anesthetize mouse with an i.p. injection of a ketamine (100  m g/ k g) -xylazine :15mg/kg) solution.2 Rapidly perfuse intracardially with 1 ml of warm phosphate buffer (30~^°C,~0.1~M,~p H~7.4) containing 10,000 IU heparin/L, followed by 5~ml of cold phosphate buffer and then by 5~ml of 4% PFA in phosphate buffer.3  Remove the brain and postfix in 4% PFA solution overnight.4  Fill each well of the multi-well plate with 1~ml of cryoprotectant solution.5 Slice the brain on the vibrating microtome at 50um to generate coronal sections.6  Collect sections into the multi-well plate.7  Keep brain sections at -20~^°C until processing.B.  Immunofluorescence staining and imaging (3 days)1.  Wash the sections in the multi-well plate with PBS for 5 min in a shaker (12 rpm); repeat this twice.2.  Move the sections to a new multi-well plate with glycine (100 mM; 1 ml per well) to quench aldehydes, and put the multi-well plate on the shaker for 30m i n .3.  Wash sections in PBS for 5 min; repeat this twice.4.  Block sections with normal donkey serum (10%) diluted in PBS with 0.1% Triton for ^2~h~ in a shaker. Add 1 ml of this blocking solution per well.5.  Dilute the antibodies, anti-GFP (dilution: 1:2,000) and anti-TH (dilution: 1:5,000), in PBS with 2% of normal donkey serum and 0.02% of Triton.6.  Move the sections to a new multi-well plate containing both the anti-GFP and anti-TH antibody (1 ml per well), and let the sections incubate on a shaker at 4^°C overnight (minimum 16~h ; for better results, leave the antibody incubating over the weekend).7.  Wash the sections in PBS for 5 min on the shaker. Repeat this twice.8.  Incubate for ^zh with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (dilution: 1:200 in PBS-T 0.02% ) on the shaker at room temperature.9.  Wash the sections in PBS for 5 min; repeat this twice.10. Mount sections on slides in phosphate buffer and let them dry for 5 min.11. When completely dried, put a few drops of the mounting medium on the section and coverslip, being careful not to create bubbles.12. Leave the slides in the dark, overnight at room temperature.13. Apply nail polish around the edges of the coverslip; this is to prevent the coverslip from moving as the mounting medium will not dry.14. Store slides in slide storage boxes at 4^°C . The fluorescence signal typically lasts for 2 years.15.

Swab the tissue chopper with 70% ethanol and secure a fresh razor blade in place, which has been wiped first with acetone to remove any grease and then swabbed with 70% ethanol.5.  Make up fresh sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid.6.  Terminally anaesthetise mouse, aged between 8-20 days by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60m g/k g) . When all pedal withdrawal reflexes have ceased and there is no response to a strong pinch of the hind limb, nor a corneal reflex, the animal is considered to be sufficiently anaesthetised for the procedure.7.  Open the chest up and cut away the rib cage to expose the heart. A trans-cardiac perfusion is then performed through the left ventricle with ^25ml of ice cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid to enhance viability of slices. This is illustrated by Gage et al. (2012). Note: This procedure is carried out using fixative and for this protocol, sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid is administered via a syringe – a pump system is not required.8.  Remove the dorsal skin and perform a dorsal laminectomy to expose the spinal cord. Remove the spinal cord using fine spring scissors and fine forceps and place in a 50~m m Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium (Figure 2). This is procedure is illustrated in a video taken from Gunther et al. (2012). Note: In this example the procedure is carried on fixed tissue. For organotypic slice cultures the spinal cord must not be placed in paraformaldehyde solution after it has been dissected free but in cold dissection medium.()Figure 2. A series of images depicting the dissection of the spinal cord9.  Remove the meninges (pia, arachnoid and dura mater) under a dissecting microscope, using fine forceps. Select the mid-lower thoracic/upper lumbar region of the spinal cord (approximately T8-L2; Figure 3).()Figure 3. Removing the meninges from the spinal cord. A. A diagram displaying the meninges (taken from Medical Dictionary, accessed May 2016); B. An image depicting removal of the meninges; C. A diagram displaying the region selected for culture.10. Transfer the selected region of spinal cord, using a microspatula, onto a sterile filter paper moistened with dissection medium that is situated on the plate of the tissue chopper and cut 300um transverse slices.11. Transfer the slices, using a microspatula, to a Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium, this will remove any excitotoxic chemicals and debris.12. Under a dissection microscope using fine forceps and a microspatula, separate the slices and discard any damaged slices. Note: All procedures from this point onwards are performed in a laminar flow hood.13. Pipette 1 ml of pre-acclimatised culture medium into each well of a sterile 6-well culture plate and, using sterile forceps, place a millicell organotypic filter insert on top of the culture medium.14. Immediately following this, using a Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip that has had the end cut off to widen the diameter (thus limiting damage to the slices), transfer 2 to 6 slices onto each filter. Care must be taken that the slices are not touching each other or the side of the filter. Remove all excess medium from around the slice by means of a Gilson pipette with sterile tip; ensure there is no medium above the filter (Figure 4).()Figure 4. Method for preparing organotypic slice culture15. Transfer culture plate to the incubator, where slices are maintained at 37~^°C under standard conditions; 100% humidity, 95% air, 5% C O_2 enriched environment.16. After ^24~h~ in culture, using sterile forceps to lift the organotypic filter insert carefully out of the well, remove culture medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip and replace the culture medium with 1~ml of serum-free medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip. Carefully place filter back onto the fresh medium, ensuring that there are no air bubbles under the filter. The serum is required initially, as it aids the slices in recovery from the trauma of explantation. The key advantage of changing to serum free medium is that the exact constituents can be determined. Serum may also contain substances that influence the growth of a particular population of cells and may promote microglial proliferation (Coltman and Ide, 1996).17. For the remaining time in culture, remove half the medium (0.5m) ) and replace with 0.5ml of fresh serum free medium, every second day. This technique leaves some of the natural growth factors, which assists in maintaining good viability in the cultured slices. The cultured slices maintain good morphology (Figure 5).()Figure 5. An organotypic spinal cord slice growing in cultureB.  Addition of 5-ethynyl- calZ^ -deoxyuridine (EdU) to organotypic cultures1.  After 48h in culture, add 1~ul of EdU (1 m M) directly to the 1 ml of medium in each well. Add fresh EdU (0.5~u/) following any subsequent medium changes. EdU is a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA during active synthesis in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Figure 6) (Chehrehasa et al., 2009) providing a fast and reproducible method to employ for the study of cell proliferation (Figure 7).Note: This stage can be omitted if you do not wish to investigate cell proliferation.()Figure 6. EdU is incorporated into the newly synthesised DNA and visualised with addition of click chemistry and a fluorescent azideFigure 7. Timeline for culturing slices. Schematic of the timing for culturing slices and addition of EdU.()2.  After the allotted time in culture, fix the slices by removing the filter from the 6-well culture plate, with slices in situ and place on top of 1~ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer in a new 6-well culture plate. Carefully apply a further 500~ul of the 4% paraformaldehyde solution on top of the filter, covering the slices completely.3.  Leave slices in fixative for 6h at 4^°C .4.  Using a fine paint brush, carefully ease the slice free from the filter and place individually in 500 ul0.1 M phosphate buffered saline in a 24-well histology tray. Note: Slices can be stored at 4^°C in phosphate buffered saline for up to 7 days at this point.# C.  EdU detection in organotypic culturesSlices are kept in the 24-well histology tray throughout and this technique of free floating the slices is continued during the procedure. Each solution is removed from the well carefully at the end of allotted time using a pipette and the next solution carefully added by allowing it to run down the side of the well and not directly on top of the delicate slices. Unless otherwise stated, all steps are carried out at room temperature, with gentle agitation of the sections on a shaker plate.1.  Incubate in 500ul PBS with 0.2% Triton for 12m i n .2.  Wash 2×10 min in 500ul 0.1 M Tris buffer.3.  Incubate slices in a mix of 320~ul distilled water, 25~ul Tris buffer (2 M), 50ul copper sulphate :10m M) ), 5ul biotinylated azide (1 mM) and 100ul ascorbic acid (0.5M) in each well (make up fresh each time) for 30m i n .4.  Wash 2 x 10 min in 500 µl 0.1 M Tris buffer.5.  Wash 1x10 min in 500ul PBS.6.  Incubate in Streptavidin Alexa555 1:1,000 in 500~ul PBS with 0.1 % Triton for 1~h~ , protect from light by wrapping histology tray in tin foil for this and any subsequent steps.7.  Wash 3 x 10 min in 500ulP B S .8.  The sections can then be immunohistochemically labelled with appropriate antibodies following instructions of the supplier at this stage before mounting (Figure 8). Note: The slices are not agitated for longer than 2 h in the primary antibodies, as they start to disintegrate. If longer incubation time is required, leave in the histology tray without agitation at 4^°C .9.  Free float the slices in a Petri dish of distilled water and carefully float the slice onto a glass slideand guide into position with a fine paint brush.10. Protect from light and allow to air dry.11. Mount using VectaShield mounting media with or without DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).12.

Set up a minimum of 8 PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 ng of double-stranded DNA template and a minimum reaction volume of 50ul . Carry out the PCR on a thermocycler using appropriate parameters.2.  Following PCR, pool the reactions and purify the product using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 20ul of the provided EB buffer.3.  To remove carried-over plasmid, perform a restriction digest using FastDigest DpnI. Use a reaction volume of 30ul and the following thermocycler protocol: 37^°C for 1 h 80^°C for 10m i n 12^°C for infinity4.  Bring the reaction to 100~ul with nuclease-free water and purify the cassette product from the digest  using  a  CHROMASpin ^+ TE-1000  chromatography  column  according  to  the manufacturer’s instructions (see Note 1).B.  Knock-in blunt ligation1.  One day prior to transfection, plate 150,000 to 500,000 HEK293 cells per well in a 24-well plate in 500ul of growth media and place in a tissue culture incubator.2.  On the day of transfection, assemble the transfection reactions in microcentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood using 100-200 ng of purified cassette, 0.5-1.5~u9 of guide R N A+C a s9 vector, FuGENE® HD reagent at a 3:1 reagent-to-DNA ratio, and Opti-MEM I to 50ul . Perform each reaction in triplicate, making sure to include a negative (transfection reagent alone) control. Vortex the reactions briefly and incubate at room temperature for 30m i n .3.  After 30 min, aspirate media from cells and replace with 500ul of fresh growth media. Remove 50~ul of media from each well. Then, add the transfection reaction dropwise to each well, followed by gently swirling the plate to mix. Place the plate in a tissue culture incubator.4.  Two days post-transfection, trypsinize cells (see Note 2), harvest in microcentrifuge tubes, spin down at 300xg for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and aspirate the supernatant. Then, resuspend the  pellets  in 200~ul of FACS media supplemented with NucBlue® Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes® reagent and filter the cell suspension through the strainer of a Falcon test tube. Place tubes on ice, protected from light.5.  Using a FACSAria II flow cytometer, clone individual cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 200ul growth media. Briefly centrifuge (300× g) the plate after cloning and place in a tissue culture incubator for 5 days undisturbed (see Note 3). Note that this cloning process is greatly facilitated by a fluorescent reporter, either in the cassette or on the Cas9 expression vector (see Note 4).6.  After 5 days, replace old media with 200~ul of fresh media regularly until colonies are large enough to passage.7.  When passaging colonies for the first time, reserve half of the cells in each colony for diagnostic PCR to identify which colonies contain the desired knock-in event.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Generation of the Knock-in Blunt Ligation Cassette\n## PCR Setup and Execution\nSet up a minimum of 8 PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 ng of double-stranded DNA template and a minimum reaction volume of 50ul.\nCarry out the PCR on a thermocycler using appropriate parameters.\n## PCR Product Purification\nPool the reactions and purify the product using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nElute in 20ul of the provided EB buffer.\n## Restriction Digest\nPerform a restriction digest using FastDigest DpnI.\nUse a reaction volume of 30ul and the following thermocycler protocol: 37°C for 1 h, 80°C for 10m, and 12°C for infinity\n## Cassette Product Purification\nBring the reaction to 100ul with nuclease-free water.\nPurify the cassette product from the digest using a CHROMASpin+ TE-1000 chromatography column according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n## Knock-in Blunt Ligation\n## Cell Plating\nOne day prior to transfection, plate 150,000 to 500,000 HEK293 cells per well in a 24-well plate in 500ul of growth media.\nPlace the cells in a tissue culture incubator.\n## Transfection Reaction Assembly\nAssemble the transfection reactions in microcentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood using 100-200 ng of purified cassette, 0.5-1.5ug of guide RNA+Cas9 vector, FuGENE HD reagent at a 3:1 reagent-to-DNA ratio, and Opti-MEM to 50ul.\nPerform each reaction in triplicate, making sure to include a negative (transfection reagent alone) control.\nVortex the reactions briefly and incubate at room temperature for 30min.\n## Transfection\nAspirate media from cells and replace with 500ul of fresh growth media.\nRemove 50ul of media from each well and add the transfection reaction dropwise to each well.\nGently swirl the plate to mix and place the plate in a tissue culture incubator.\n## Cell Harvesting and Staining\nTwo days post-transfection, trypsinize cells and harvest in microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin down at 300xg for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in 200ul of FACS media supplemented with NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes reagent.\nFilter the cell suspension through the strainer of a Falcon test tube and place tubes on ice, protected from light.\n## Cell Cloning\nUsing a FACSAria II flow cytometer, clone individual cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 200ul growth media.\nBriefly centrifuge (300xg) the plate after cloning and place in a tissue culture incubator for 5 days undisturbed.\n## Colony Maintenance\nAfter 5 days, replace old media with 200ul of fresh media regularly until colonies are large enough to passage.\nWhen passaging colonies for the first time, reserve half of the cells in each colony for diagnostic PCR to identify which colonies contain the desired knock-in event.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-50","Bio-protocol-89","Protocol.io-5285","Bio-protocol-954","Bio-protocol-2163","Protocol.io-5286","Protocol-exchange-734","Protocol-exchange-825","Protocol.io-1247","Protocol-exchange-1027"]}

Preparation of conversion cassette SU32a.  Prepare the conversion cassette SU32 by PCR using a plasmid pSU32 as template. To obtain this template, visit the following webpage. http://www.iac.saga-u.ac.jp/lifescience/su32/index.htmb.  For PCR amplification, the primer pair was pSU30-14 and pSU30-23 (40 cycles of 98~^°C for 10 sec, 55~^°C for 15 sec, and 68~^°C for 75 sec using Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase) (Goto and Nagano, 2013). When we conduct the PCR reaction, we use Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase, but you can use the other proofreading DNA polymerases. Note: Although we purified the amplified conversion cassette in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential (purification is required for DNA quantification).c.  Confirm the amplification by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicon size is about 2.7 kb (2,651 bp) (Figure 3).()Conversion cassette SU32# Figure 3. Conversion cassette SU322.  Preparation of the linearized E. coli plasmid vector a.  Digest the E. coli plasmid vector within the crossover region by using restriction enzyme.Notes:i.   The required restriction ends can be located anywhere within the crossover regions of the vector. You can use both blunt-end restriction enzyme and sticky-end restriction enzyme, because restriction ends are not positions where joining reactions occur.ii. This E. coli plasmid vector must contain the Ampr gene.iii.  PCR amplification of the E. coli plasmid vector is another way to prepare the linearized E. coli plasmid vector.iv.  Although we purified the digested plasmid in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the digestion by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.c.

Preparation of the DNA fragment to be cloned.a.  Amplify a DNA fragment of interest by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerase suchas Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase.# Notes:i. PCR primers should be designed to carry the sequences with more than 20 bp of homology to the crossover region. We often use the sequences with 30-40 bp of homology to the crossover region. For the highest efficiency, we recommend you to use PCR primers purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the PAGE purification is not essential.ii.  Although we purified the DNA fragment of interest in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis.# 4.  Transformation of DNA fragments into yeast.# Notes:i.   In our laboratory, we perform the transformation procedure at half or quarter scale of this method. ii.   The molar ratio of the 3 DNA fragments was 1:1:1. However, this ratio is not important (Goto and Nagano, 2013). (Ten-fold variation of the ratio probably does not affect the efficiency.) Required amount of the conversion cassette SU32 is < 50n g. . b.  Select the transformants by incubating yeast cells on synthetic complete plates lacking tryptophan at 30~^°C for 2 or 3 days.# 5.  Purification of plasmid from yeast.Note: To purify plasmid DNAs from yeast, we use a Mini-M Plasmid DNA ExtractionSystem, but you can use the other Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit for E. coli.a.  Scrape all colonies from the plates with plating beads, and collect yeast cells by the centrifuge. Using the microfuge, centrifuge cells at 14,000× g for 5 sec (we often use the picofuge at a maximum speed for 30 sec). Remove the supernatant.b.  Add the suspension buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 200~ul of MX1 buffer), and suspend the yeast cells by vortexing.c.  Scoop equal amounts of acid-washed glass beads (350-500~um) to the suspended solution using 1.5~m~ tube, add glass beads into tube containing the suspended solution, and then disrupt yeast cells by shaking 3 times for 20 sec at speed 5.5 using the FastPrep FP100A. Alternatively, vortex 5 times for 1 min at maximum speed. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()d.  Add denaturation buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 250~ul of MX2 buffer), and gently mix.e.  Punch a hole in the bottom of the tube by needle (18 gauge). Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()()f.   Attach another tube to the bottom of the tube, and centrifuge them to recover the denatured solution in the bottom tube. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()g.  For subsequent procedures, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. However, use elution solution preheated to 70~^°C . Because DNA concentration of the eluted solution is low, you cannot determine the concentration of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometer. However, the DNA concentration of the eluted solution is sufficient for next procedures. Therefore, the condensation of the eluted solution is not required.6.  Pretreatment of the eluted solution (Optional)a.  For the highest efficiency, digest 5~ul of the recovered plasmids (the eluted solution) with small amounts (in.g. 0.2 lHl) ) of an appropriate restriction enzyme by directly adding the enzyme to the eluted DNA solution. Note: Because the principle of this method is complicated, read our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013) carefully. Do not add an enzyme reaction buffer, because the salt may affect the next electroporation step.b.  Incubate the tube at an appropriate temperature for more than 1 h.7.  Transformation of the eluted solution into E . coli.Transform the eluted solution into E. coli electro-competent cells by electroporation and plate them on LB agar containing 100 u/m l ampicillin.8.

After removing the supernatant, cell pellets can be frozen at -80~^°C .Note: It is preferred to wash cell pellet with  I xP B S, but this step is not required because the small amount of medium in the cell pellet does not interfere with subsequent steps.2.  Cell lysis: Re-suspend the cells that are fresh or just thawed on ice from -80~^°C with 200 μl 1x PBS and add 20ul proteinase K (20m g/m l) .3.  DNA extraction: Use DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit to get high DNA yield. Quantify DNA samples by Nanodrop. Note: Multiple methods are available to extract DNA from cells. We prefer the commercial kit since it can easily be performed to get high yield DNA.4.  DNA digestion: Digest 2.5~u DNA for 4h to overnight at 37~^°C with combination of restriction enzymes (HhaI, HinF1, MspI, HaeIII, RsaI, AluI). Prepare 2.5ug DNA in d H_2O to make 40ul total volume. Add 10~ul enzyme digestion mix to DNA sample (40~ul) , so total volume is 50~ul . Incubate in a water bath or heating block overnight at 37^°C .1 sample HhaI 0.25 μl HinF1 0.5 μl MspI 0.25 μl HaeIII 0.5 μl RsaI 0.5 μl AluI 0.5 μl NE buffer 2 5.0 μl H2O 2.5 μl Total: 10 μl5.  Gel migration: Load radiolabeled TRF ladder and unlabeled molecular weight marker on either or both sides of the samples. Separate digested DNA on 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel stained with gel red (1/20,000x) for 18h at 70 volts for a 25cm long gel in 1x TAE or 0.5× TBE buffer. 18h after samples run, check the gel under a UV source (e.g., at G-BOX) to make sure genomic DNA is completely digested and runs as a smear below the 800 bp molecular weight marker (Figure 1A). Anything above 800 bp shows incomplete genomic DNA digestion and this could interfere with the telomere signal (Figure 1B).()Figure 1. Gel with DNA ladder marker. A. DNA samples run as a smear below 800 bp (yellow dashline), showing complete digestion of genomic DNA. B. DNA samples are above 800 bp (yellow dashline), showing incomplete genomic digestion. bp: base pair# Notes:a.  Add 5 μl loading dye to the samples. While 0.5x TBE can be used to analyze less than ~8 kb, 1x TAE buffer can be used for the ones that have longer telomeres (8 to 20 kb range) to have better separation.b.  400 ml volume is good enough for 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel in large gel system.c.  Radiolabeled TRF marker can be visualized after hybridization with telomere sequence-specific probe. The unlabeled, digested plasmid DNA can be visualized with Gel Red, not with the telomere sequence specific probe.d.  To prevent leaking of the gel from the gel tray: Wait 20 min after agarose is dissolved in microwave. During this time, seal the space between the gel tray and gaskets (edges of gel tray) with 5-10 ml agarose gel (Figure 2A). Wait 30 min following the pour of the gel (do not forget the put comb when you pour the gel).e.  Higher concentration of agarose in buffer will cause poor separation of samples and TRF marker (Figure 2B) and also processing gel drying will take a much more time than lower concentration of agarose.()Figure 2. Preparation of agarose gel electrophoresis. A. This figure shows how to seal between the gaskets and gel tray with agarose gel to prevent leaking. B. The separation difference between 0.7% and 1.4% agarose gel. While 0.7% agarose gel shows good separation on the TRF ladder, TRF ladder on 1.4% agarose gel is not separated well. 25~ul and 12.5~ul ladder was loaded in each lane of 0.7% and 1.4% gels, respectively. TRF ladder 1 and 2 in 1.4% gel are the same ladders. TRF ladder units are kilobase (kb).# 6.  DNA Hybridization:a.  Denature the gel for 20 min in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH solution (p H13.2) in a Pyrex® container (slowly shake). Make sure that denaturing solution covers the gel during shaking.b.  Rinse gel with MilliQ® water to remove NaOH.c.  Put the gel upside down on 2 sheets of 3MM Whatman® paper and wrap on the top of the gel (Figure 3A and B).d.  Dry the gel using a gel dryer 56^°C for 3~h~ ).e.  Transfer the gel to a Pyrex® container, rinse with MilliQ® water and remove the Whatman® paper.f.    Neutralize the gel for 30m i n with 0.5 M Tris-HCl and 1.5 M NaCl solution (pH 8). Make sure that neutralization solution covers the gel during shaking.g.  Wrap gel around _25ml pipette and transfer gel to a cylindrical hybridization tube. Note: Make sure that caps are sealed well and don’t leak.h.  Prehybridize the gel with 10ml hybridization solution for at least 10 min at 42^°C in hybridization oven.i. Add 12.5ul hot probe (see step 7 at below) to a fresh 10m hybridization solution and let it hybridize overnight at 42^°C rotating hybridization oven. Notes: i.  Be careful when you are working with radioactive material. Protect yourself with a shield and try to avoid any contamination to the work area. ii. Remove hot hybridization buffer and keep it for next use (it can be used two times or place into radioactive liquid waste).()Figure 3. The method for drying the gel (A and B).

Washing: Wash the gel once in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 15m i n at 42^°C , then wash the gel twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 15 min at 42^°C . Finally, wash the gel twice in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS for 15 min at 42^°C . 10-15 ml washing solution can be used for each washing step at 42^°C rotating hybridization oven. Note: Prepare the washing solutions in the following order: SSC, water, SDS so they dissolve easily.9.  Exposure: Prepare the gel for scanning. Briefly, wrap the gel with plastic (Saran type) wrap in the cassette and put the screen on the gel (Figure 4). Expose it at least 4 h, preferably overnight. Scan the screen on Typhoon PhosphorImager.()Figure 4. Illustrates the preparation of the gel for scanning step by step. Prepare the saran plastic wrap in an appropriate cassette size and spread it into the cassette. Then, put gel onto this plastic wrap and cover the gel by wrapping with additional plastic wrap. Place screen on top of the gel that is surrounded plastic wrap, then incubate it in a dark place. All steps should be done behind a protective shield.10.

ImageJ (freely available from National Institutes of Health, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n# A.  Cell cultureNote: This protocol was optimized for nuclear isolation and chromatin fractionation of roughly 4x 107 A549 cells (for A549 cells that are approximately two I O O% confluent 150 mm cell culture dishes). This number of cells was chosen for efficient nuclear isolation as described in Procedure B. This protocol can be used for other cell types but should be optimized accordingly.1.  For each condition, grow roughly 4×10^7 A549 cells in F-12K media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. Note: Time treatments such that the required cell number is reached at the time of harvest.2.  Harvest cells using trypsin and combine into one 15ml tube per condition.3.  Centrifuge for 2 min, 500×g , room temperature using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor SX4750).4.  Wash cells once with 10ml of PBS and centrifuge again for 2 min, 500× g_: room temperature.5.  Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.6.  Flash freeze samples in liquid nitrogen.7.  Store samples at -80~^°C until ready to process.# B.  Nuclear isolationNote: This section describes two alternative methods for nuclear isolation. The procedure detailed in B1 yields a clean nuclear fraction but B2 is recommended for highly mobile nuclear proteins that are lost from the nuclear fraction when mild detergents are used as described in B1 (see example in Figure 2).()# Isolation with detergent# Isolation with DounceFigure 2. Fractionation of nuclear protein HMGB1 can differ depending on the method of nuclear isolation. Western blot of chromatin fractionation of A549 cells using different methods of nuclear isolation. HMGB1 is lost from nuclei during nuclear isolation B1 using NP-40 and a sucrose cushion. HMGB1 is retained in the nuclear fraction during isolation of nuclei with the alternative method described in step B2.1.  Nuclear isolation using mild detergent and sucrose cushion.Note: This section describes permeabilizing the cell membrane using a mild detergent (NP-40), followed by separation of the nuclei from cytoplasmic debris by sucrose cushion. The sucrose cushion consists of a layer with 1.2 M sucrose at the bottom (Buffer II) and a layer with 0.32 M sucrose on top (Buffer I, Figure 3A). The nuclei are more dense than the 1.2 M sucrose buffer and will pellet at the bottom of the tube while the less dense cytoplasmic debris will remain in the upper sucrose layer (Figure 3B).a.  Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).b.  In the meantime, prepare one aliquot each of Buffer I.A and I.B by addition of PMSF, DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail immediately before use (see Recipes for final concentrations). Add NP-40 to Buffer I.B.c.  Gently resuspend cells in _2 m of Buffer I.A using a 5~ml pipette. Avoid the formation of bubbles.d.  Set aside 50ul of the cell suspension in a new tube labeled ‘cells fraction’.e.  Add _2 m of Buffer I.B containing NP-40 to the _2 m of cell suspension and mix gently by inverting the tube 2-3 times.f.  Incubate samples on ice for 10m i n . Mix gently by inverting after 5 min.g.  Pipette 8ml of ice-cold Buffer II into 30ml reusable centrifuge tubes (one per sample).h.  Carefully layer cell suspension onto Buffer II (Figure 3A).i.  If the number of tubes is even, balance the tubes with Buffer I.A before centrifugation. If the number of tubes is uneven, use an additional tube containing water as balance.j. Centrifuge for 20 min, 10,000xg , 4^°C using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor FX6100) with low brakes (deceleration setting 1 for this centrifuge model, 5-10 min of deceleration for other centrifuge models) to avoid disruption of pellet. Note: Use the adapters listed in the Equipment section under 4 to fit the 30 ml reusable centrifuge tubes into the FX6100 rotor. The nuclei form a dense pellet at the bottom of the tube while the cytoplasmic debris remains in the upper sucrose layer, Figure 3C.k.  Carefully remove the supernatant using a transfer pipette. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C.()Figure 3. Intermediate steps of nuclear isolation. A. Layers of the sucrose cushion.

Pellet of nuclei after spin at 10,000xg indicated by red arrow. The buffers were removed before these pictures were taken.# 2.  Nuclear isolation by manual disruptionNote: Using mild detergents such as NP-40 for nuclear isolation is important to ensure that the nuclear membrane remains largely intact. In some cases, highly mobile nuclear proteins such as HMGB1 (Sapojnikova et al., 2005) may diffuse out of the nucleus upon isolation with this method. To prevent loss of these proteins from the nuclear fraction, we adapted an alternative method that relies on a hypotonic buffer and subsequent manual disruption of the cell membrane using a Dounce homogenizer. The short centrifugation times in this step minimize diffusion of these proteins out of the nuclei (Figure 2).a.  Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).b.  Gently resuspend cells in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and transfer into a 1.7 m tube using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips) to avoid disrupting the cellular membranes.c.  Set aside 25ul of the cell suspension in a new tube as ‘cells fraction’. Note: This is proportional to the 50 μl aliquot taken from 2 ml of cell suspension in step B1.d.  Incubate on ice for 30min .e.  Pre-cool the Dounce homogenizer and the pestle on ice for at least 5 min.f.  Transfer the cell suspension to cold Dounce homogenizer using a transfer pipette.# bio-protocolg.  Disrupt the cell membrane using 40 strokes of the tight-fitting pestle. Minimize the formation of bubbles.h.  Transfer sample to 1.7ml tube using a transfer pipette.i. Centrifuge for 5 min, 1,500xg , 4^°C using a tabletop centrifuge.j. Carefully remove the supernatant using a P1000 pipette. Transfer supernatant and label as ‘cytosol fraction’ if desired. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C. Note: The nuclei form a loose pellet at the bottom of the tube that can be easily disturbed. The cytoplasmic fraction in step B1 is too dilute to isolate as a result of the sucrose cushion.# C.  Micrococcal nuclease digestionNote: In this step the DNA is digested to the length of mono-nucleosomes (roughly 150 bp) using MNase. While partial MNase digest in combination with nuclear fractionation by salt gradient can be used to separate euchromatin from heterochromatin (Teves and Henikoff, 2012), our protocol aims to identify global association of proteins with chromatin and does not distinguish between different types of chromatin. Subsequently, it is important that the DNA is completely digested into mononucleosomes to break up chromatin and allow for elution of all soluble proteins in Procedure D (Figure 4). EGTA is used instead of EDTA to stop the MNase digestion as EGTA preferentially chelates C a^2+ ions that are necessary for MNase enzymatic activity but does not impact M g^2+ ions important for protein-protein interactions. Proteins loosely bound to chromatin elute during MNase digest and can be detected in the supernatant collected in this section of the protocol.()Figure 4. Digestion of cellular DNA using MNase. Agarose gel analysis of DNA extracted from nuclei during a time course of MNase treatment. The position of DNA bands corresponding to mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes are indicated on the left while the DNA size in base pairs (bp)is indicated on the right. Without MNase digestion (0 min), cellular DNA barely enters the agarose gel because of the large size of the DNA molecules. After 1 min of MNase digestion, DNA fragments show the characteristic banding pattern of multiples of 150 bp. After 5 min the DNA fragments correspond to one to three nucleosomes in length. After 30 min most DNA fragments are close to 150 bp, indicating the desired digestion of cellular DNA necessary for optimal chromatin fractionation. The high concentration of DNA causes the slightly lower shift of the mono-nucleosome band. The nuclei used for this time course were isolated using method B.1. No differences in MNase digestion efficiency have been observed with nuclei isolated using method B.2.1.  Prepare and cool Buffer III.A and III.B.2.  Add 400ul Buffer III.A to the nuclei.3.  Gently resuspend the nuclei using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips)to avoid disrupting the nuclear membranes.4.  Add 5ul of MNase (1 U) and incubate at 37^°C (in a water bath) for 30 min.5.  Mix every 10 min by gently inverting the tube 2-3 times.6.  After 30m i n , add 25ul of ice-cold 0.1 M EGTA to stop the digest.7.  Set aside a 60~ul aliquot of the nuclear suspension as ‘nuclei fraction’ and for DNA isolation toconfirm the sufficient digest of DNA (described in Procedure E).8.  Centrifuge for 10m i n , 400xg , 4^°C .9.  Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ‘MNase fraction’.10. Wash the nuclei once by resuspending them in 400ul Buffer III.B.11. Centrifuge again for 10 min, 400xg , 4^°C . Discard the supernatant.# D.  Chromatin fractionationNote: In this step the nuclei are further fractionated using buffers with increasing amounts of NaCl. Proteins only weakly bound to DNA are expected to be soluble under low salt conditions and will elute from nuclei in the buffers with low NaCl concentration. Proteins tightly bound to chromatin only become soluble under high salt conditions and only elute from nuclei in the buffers with high NaCl concentration.1.  Gently resuspend the nuclei in 400ul Buffer IV.80 using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips).2.  Rotate at 4^°C for 30m i n .3.  Centrifuge for 10 min, 400× g,4^°C .4.  Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ^°0m M fraction’.5.  Repeat steps D1-D4 with Buffer IV.150, IV.300 and IV.600 in that order. Keep the supernatants as fractions '150m M^ , ^°300m M^ and ^600m M^ , respectively.6.  Prepare samples for Western blot immediately (see Table 1 in Procedure F) or store at -20~^°C .# E.  DNA isolation and DNA gelNote: In this step, DNA is isolated from the samples after MNase digestion to test the length of DNA fragments. The goal is to digest the DNA down to mono-nucleosome level of around 150 bp to ensure optimal chromatin fractionation (Figure 4). It is important that orange G or another small molecular weight dye is used for loading the DNA. Commonly used DNA loading dyes such as bromophenol blue run around the same size as 150 bp of DNA and may obscure the results.1.  Dilute 10ul of the ‘nuclei’ fraction in 90 uI H_2O for better DNA purification.2.  Use a PCR purification kit to isolate the DNA from this sample following the kit instructions. Elute the DNA in 30ul of H_2O .3.  Take out 5~ul (about 5u. ) of DNA and add 1~ul of 6× Orange G. Keep the rest of the DNA on ice until results are finalized or freeze at -20~^°C .4.  Run samples and a 100 bp ladder on a 2% agarose gel containing 1x GelRed at 100 V for 1 h.5.  Visualize the DNA using gel imager and check for prominent DNA band of around 150 bp with minimal DNA laddering (Figure 4).F.  Verifying the quality of nuclear fractionation by Western blotNote: The quality of the nuclear fractionation can be analyzed using SDS-PAGE combined with Western blotting (Figure 1G). Efficient nuclear isolation can be tested by probing for proteins such as tubulin that are only found in the cytoplasm. The quality of chromatin fractionation can be tested by probing for histone proteins such as histone H3 or proteins expected to bind histone tails such as bromodomain containing protein Brd1 (Sanchez et al., 2014). The interaction of the histone H3 and Brd1 with chromatin should only be disrupted under high salt conditions. In addition, proteomics can be performed to identify changes to global chromatin composition under different conditions.

Sensor designFor yeast expression, CHL1/NRT1.1 or PTRs coding regions were inserted by Gateway LR reactions into the E.coli/yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30, a destination vector that sandwiches the sensory domain between Aphrodite t9 and mCerulean (Jones et al., 2014), following manufacturer’s instructions. The E. coli/yeast vector pDRFlip30 is used for expressing the NiTracs or PepTracs from a PMA1 (yeast proton ATPase) promoter fragment. pDRFlip30 contains the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) terminator, and the URA3 marker for auxotrophy selection in yeast (Figure 1). pDRFlip30 is a vector that allows us to sandwich the transporter of interest by translational fusion between an N-terminal Aphrodite t9 (AFPt9) variant (aphrodite is a codon-diversified gene producing Venus; Deuschle et al., 2006), lacking nine amino acids at its C-terminus and a C-terminal monomeric Cerulean (mCer; Rizzo et al., 2006).B.  Yeast transformationThe  protease-deficient  yeast  strain  BJ5465  MATa ura3­52 trp1 leu2­Δ1 his3­Δ 200 pep4::HIS3 prb1­Δ1.6R can1 GAL  is  transformed  with  the  pDRFlip30  vector containing the desired NiTracs and PepTracs by using the modified Lithium Acetatemethod from Gietz et al., 1992. In brief:1.  Inoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30^°C overnight to O D_600n m0.5 .2.  Spin down (2,000xg) 1 ml of cells in microfuge tube (15 sec) for each transformation.3.  Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100ul of liquid medium by vortexing.4.  Add 2ul of 10m g/m l carrier DNA, vortex.5.  Add 1 u plasmid, vortex.6.  Add 20ul~1 M DTT, vortex.7.  Add 0.5ml of ‘PLATE mixture’ ( 100ml stock containing 90ml of 45% PEG4000, 10 ml of 1 M lithium acetate, 1 ml of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2ml of 0.5 M EDTA), vortex.8.  Incubate at RT for 68 h or overnight.9.  Heat-shock cells for 10 min at 42^°C .10. Place pipet tip directly into bottom of tube, withdraw 50-100~ul of cells and plate cells on solid -ura DropOut medium. Plates are wrapped with plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration.11. Plates are incubated (lid down) at 30^°C for 2-3 days.C.  Detection of NiTrac and PepTrac responses in yeast using a fluorimeter1.  Single colonies are picked using sterile pipette tips and grown in a 50ml tube containing 10ml -ura DropOut liquid medium. Pick at least three independent colonies. Use fresh transformation; do not keep colonies for more than one week on plates to avoid mutations in yeast or plasmid.2.  Place tubes in a rack and incubate in an incubator for 15h under agitation (230 rpm) at 30^°C until the culture reaches O D_600n m0.5 .3.  Liquid cultures are subcultured after dilution to O D600n m~0.01 in the same liquid medium and grown at 30^°C until OD600nm reaches 0.2 .4.  Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4,000× g_: , RT for 7 min, to sediment the cells.5.  Discard the supernatant and resuspend the sediment by vortexing in 10mI ‘Wash buffer’, 15 sec, RT.6.  Centrifuge as described above (step B4).7.  Wash the sediment two more times as in step B4 to B6, to remove traces of growth medium.8.  Resuspend the sediment to O D_600n m0.5 in ‘Resuspension buffer’.9.  Mix cells well and aliquot 100ul of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate.10. Fluorescence is measured in a fluorescence plate reader, in bottom reading mode using 7.5~n m bandwidth for both excitation and emission. Typically, emission spectra are recorded with the following instrument settings: λem 470-570 nm for donor (mCer), step size 5 nm, gain: 75; and λem 520-570 nm for AFPt9, step size 5 nm, gain: 75. Fluorescence from cultures harboring pDRFlip30 (donor: mCer) is measured with excitation at ambda_exc428n m ; AFPt9 is measured with excitation at λexc 500 nm.11. A single- or multichannel pipette is used to add 100~ul of the culture to wells (mix by pipetting up and down) and to add analyte solution to the cells. Set up at least three replicates per treatment. Try to add equal amounts of solutions to reduce variability and use well-calibrated pipettes since the assays are quantitative and sensitive to differences in volumes/ concentration of sensor and analyte.12. Record the fluorescence immediately (as fast as possible) after substrate or control solution addition. It takes about 10 min to read a full 96 well plate with the parameters mentioned above. For highly accurate analyses, measure only a few wells at a time to reduce differences in analysis time. It is also possible to use instruments with injectors that allow for immediate recording; use rapid switching between wells to record over time.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Sensor Design\nInsert CHL1/NRT1.1 or PTRs coding regions into the E.coli/yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30 by Gateway LR reactions.\nUse the E. coli/yeast vector pDRFlip30 for expressing the NiTracs or PepTracs from a PMA1 promoter fragment.\npDRFlip30 contains the ADH terminator and the URA3 marker for auxotrophy selection in yeast.\n## Yeast Transformation\nInoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30°C overnight to OD600nm ~0.5.\nSpin down 1 ml of cells in a microfuge tube and resuspend in 100ul of liquid medium.\n## Transformation Procedure\nAdd 2ul of 10mg/ml carrier DNA and vortex.\nAdd 1ul plasmid and vortex.\nAdd 20ul of 1M DTT and vortex.\nAdd 0.5ml of 'PLATE mixture' and vortex.\nIncubate at RT for 6-8 hours or overnight.\nHeat-shock cells for 10 minutes at 42°C.\nPlace cells on solid -ura DropOut medium and incubate at 30°C for 2-3 days.\n## Detection of NiTrac and PepTrac Responses in Yeast\nPick single colonies and grow in 10ml -ura DropOut liquid medium.\nIncubate in an incubator for 15 hours under agitation at 30°C until the culture reaches OD600nm ~0.5.\n## Cell Preparation\nSubculture after dilution to OD600nm ~0.01 in the same liquid medium.\nGrow at 30°C until OD600nm reaches 0.2.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 4,000×g, RT for 7 minutes.\nWash cells with 'Wash buffer' and resuspend in 'Resuspension buffer'.\n## Fluorescence Measurement\nMix cells well and aliquot 100ul of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate.\nMeasure fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader using specific instrument settings.\nAdd analyte solution to the cells and record fluorescence immediately after addition.","evidence_ids":["Protocol.io-16","Protocol.io-682","Bio-protocol-2279","Bio-protocol-1541","Protocol.io-2284","Protocol.io-4118","Protocol.io-1486","Protocol.io-1767","Protocol.io-9791","Protocol-exchange-590"]}

Piranha preparation and treatment to clean cover glassesNote: Be very careful as the Piranha solution used in this step is extremely corrosive. Follow your institution’s safety regulations. We recommend, at least, wearing a lab coat, a full-length rubber apron coat, long-sleeve butyl gloves, a full-face splash shield, and working under a chemical fume hood free of flammable organic chemicals. Use PYREX glassware for preparation of Piranha solutions (regular soda-lime glass beakers may crack upon heating when Pirahna solutions are prepared).1.  Place 12 coverslips into ceramic rack using flat-tip tweezers.2.  In a designated chemical fume hood, place two clean 250~ml PYREX beakers (beaker 1 and 2) in two separate crystallization dishes. The dishes serve as secondary containers to ensure safety.3.  Very carefully add 1 part (50ml) of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) to beaker 1, followed by 3 parts ( ^.150ml) of concentrated sulfuric acid (H_2S O_4) . Gently stir to mix the solution with a clean glass rod. The solution will immediately form bubbles and heat up to 100^°C .4.  Using forceps, very carefully transfer the rack with the coverslips into beaker 1 and incubate for 30 min. To ensure safety, leave a note indicating that Piranha is in use.5.  Repeat Piranha treatment one more time with a fresh Piranha solution in beaker 2.6.  Transfer the coverslips from beaker 2 into a Nalgene 125~ml polypropylene jar filled with double-distilled water. Dispose of piranha waste according to your institution’s regulations. Rinse the coverslips copiously with double-distilled water until pH stabilizes (verified by pH paper). The cleaned coverslips can be stored in double-distilled water without noticeable changes in reactivity and fluorescent background for at least 1 month.7.  Quality control. a.  Surface hydrophilicity. Piranha-treated coverslips become uniformly hydrophilic, which can be qualitatively verified by dipping a coverslip in water using flat-end tweezers, taking it out vertically, and observing water slowly receding as a uniform sheet, and forming Young’s rings before drying out. In contrast, untreated coverslips form patches of water when dipped into and taken out of waterb.  Fluorescent background. After Piranha treatment, blow-dry a coverslip with pressurized pure nitrogen (see step C12) and place it onto a total-internal-reflection microscope. One should observe essentially no fluorescent spots <3 identifiable ‘spots’ per 100×100 micron area) under typical single-molecule imaging conditions (excitation with 532 and 640n m sources at density 0.5k W/c m^2 , imaging in 580/60 nm and 670/45 nm optical bands, sampling rate 2.5H z ).B.  Mild KOH etching to maximize the density of silanol groups on the glass surface (Iler, 1979) 8.  Transfer the Piranha-treated coverslips from water to a clean 250ml polypropylene jar containing 125ml of 0.5 M KOH, then sonicate for 1 h in a bath sonicator.a.  Be sure that the water level is up to the marked operating level, and is about level with the solution inside the jar.b.  Ensure that the temperature does not exceed 40~^°C by supplying ice ( 100200 g. by estimation) at t=0 and t=30 min during sonication. Otherwise the bath will heat up, which accelerates etching of the coverslips and creates micron-size pits in the glass surfaces.c.  Transfer the coverslips back into the polypropylene jar containing water and copiously rinse the coverslips with double-distilled water until  p H stabilizes, as verified by pH paper.C.  Silanization to create amine groups on glass surfaceNote: In this step, the glass surface is functionalized with amine groups by incubating in a solution of APTES. Although APTES is one the best studied silanization agents, there is currently no consensus on the best method to cost-effectively create molecularly homogenous, reactive, stable APTES films. The parameter space for APTES deposition conditions is vast, as the quality of films has been shown to depend on the substrate (e.g. glass, silica, or oxidized silicon), surface cleaning method, deposition phase (e.g. liquid or vapor), water content of the solvent and the surface, concentration of APTES, temperature, incubation times, and annealing conditions for references, see Kim et al. (2009). Our procedure is based on the simple technique introduced to the single-molecule imaging field by Ha and colleagues (Ha et al., 2002). In our hands, more sophisticated deposition methods did not create APTES surfaces superior to the ones prepared per Ha et al. (2002).9.  Under a fume hood, prepare three clean 125ml polypropylene jars (maximal capacity of 170ml ) containing 125ml acetone.10. Connect a non-coring needle to a 10 cc gas-tight glass syringe via a PTFE valve. Close the PTFE valve. Insert the needle through the septum of the APTES bottle and ensure that the needle orifice is below the surface of the APTES. Create slight positive pressure inside the APTES sealed bottle using a nitrogen line and a second non-coring needle. Open the PTFE valve. Withdraw 3.75ml of APTES with the syringe and closethe PTFE valve. Remove the needle from the bottle, open the PTFE valve, and add the APTES into the 125ml of acetone in one of the jars. Gently stir to prepare 3% APTES.11. Using forceps, remove the rack with coverslips from double-distilled water, and dip the rack successively into the two 125ml polypropylene jars containing acetone, spending 10 sec in each jar with gentle agitation. Then transfer immediately into the freshly prepared 3% APTES solution. Do not allow acetone to dry between transfers. Place the APTES container on a horizontal platform shaker and incubate for 1~h~ .Note: Immediately after use, during silanization, rinse the syringe, the syringe needles, and the PTFE valve sequentially with acetone and double-distilled water, and then blow with dry nitrogen. Also, during silanization, prepare PEG solutions (steps D14-15).12. After silanization, wash the coverslips with acetone by dipping the rack in the two jars containing acetone (see step C11) in reverse order and place the rack back into doubledistilled water. Copiously rinse with double-distilled water. Do not let the coverslips spend more than 5 min in water. Blow the coverslips dry one-by-one with nitrogen. To that end, hold a coverslip on its corner with the flat-end tweezers, and direct the nitrogen gas flow across the surface of the coverslip towards the corner held by the tweezers. When dry, place the coverslip on a piece of Parafilm positioned on a flat, clean surface. Mark the upper surface of the coverslip by scoring the upper-left corner with a diamond scriber. The coverslips are now ready for PEGylation. Notes:a.  We usually carry out PEGylation in a clean environment (e.g., a positive-pressure HEPA-filtered room), but we also have had success in a regular environment if PEGylation was carried out immediately after treatment by APTES. We typically do not store amine-treated coverslips.b.  Many APTES deposition protocols include a high-temperature curing step following silanization, meant to form stable covalent bonds between physisorbed APTES molecules (Plueddemann, 1982). However, on the molecular scale, curing may lead to lateral rearrangement of APTES molecules and create islands of unmodified glass (Kim et al., 2009). In our hands, curing offered no additional improvement in surface quality in terms of preventing non-specific adsorption of biomolecules.13. Quality control: Concentration of amine groups. You can measure the concentration of amine groups on coverslip surfaces using TRIONE ninhydrin reagent. To that end, crush one coverslip by placing it into a 50ml Falcon tube and centrifuging at 2,000× g in a swing-bucket centrifuge for 1 min. Then fill the tube with 1ml of the ninhydrin reagent and follow the manufacturer’s protocol to spectrophotometrically quantify the average density of amine groups on the coverslip surface (for 24×40~m m coverslips, with the thickness of 0.15~m m , the total surface area is 1,940 m m^2) ). Using standard dilutions of APTES as create a calibration curve, we typically get 3 amine groups per n m^2 .D.  Treatment of amine-glass surfaces with NHS-PEG at cloud-point conditions Notes:a.  The procedure builds upon the method introduced by Ha et al. (2002), with modifications to maximize the density of PEG molecules, and to block and neutralize positively charged amine groups after PEG deposition (section E). Thus, amine-treated coverslips are coupled to succinimidyl-PEG at pH 9.0 in a bicarbonate buffer containing 0.45 M kappa_2S O_4 , at 10.0 % NHS-PEG (w/v). The high salt and the high PEG concentration bring the PEG solution just below its ‘cloud point’, which maximizes the density of the PEG layer on the surface (Kingshott et al., 2002).b.  NHS group hydrolyzes in aqueous buffers, which makes NHS-PEG non-reactive. The lifetime of the NHS group is between a few seconds and a few minutes, depending on the nature of the NHS-PEG linker, pH, and temperature (Hermanson, 2008). For example, we found that NHS-SVA hydrolyses with a half-life of 5 min at p Hvartheta.O at room temperature, which is a good compromise between the reactivity of the NHS group and the reactive species lifetime. Thus, our protocol minimizes the time the reactive NHS-SVA species spends at p H=9.0 prior to addition to the amine-glass surface. Specifically, we initially dissolve dry PEG-SVA at p H6.0_z , at which the NHS group remains unhydrolyzed for at least 1 h. Then, immediately before addition of the PEG solution to the glass surface, we bring the pH up to 9.0. If you are using a nonSVA linker, you have to optimize the pH of the reaction to achieve the NHS lifetime of ~5 min.c.  The lifetime of the reactive NHS group can be measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the kinetics of accumulation of free NHS upon hydrolysis free NHS strongly adsorbs at 260 nm (Miron, 1982). We also highly recommend measuring the percentage of reactive PEG-NHS in new batches of purchased PEG reagents. We have had cases in which completely hydrolyzed, non-reactive PEGs had been shipped by major suppliers.14. This step is best done during the APTES incubation at step C11. Take out 6 single-use aliquots of dry mPEG-SVA from storage at -80~^°C . Each aliquot should be about 5:mg , which is sufficient to treat two coverslips. The mass of dry mPEG-SVA in the 6 aliquots should have been pre-written on each tube with 0.1 mg accuracy prior to storage at - 80^°C (e.g., 4.9, 5.0, 5,1, 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1 mg for 6 tubes). In addition, take out 1-2m g of biotin-PEG-SVA from storage. Let all tubes warm up to room temperature.15. This step is best done during the APTES incubation at step C11. Calculate the volume of 0.5 M K2SO4 solution to add to each mPEG-SVA tube by multiplying the aliquot mass by 8 (e.g., the tube containing 4.9~m g will require 4.9×8=39.2~ul of K_2S O_4 solution) and record all volumes in a notebook. Sum up all the volumes, to get the minimal volume of 0.5 M K_2S O_4 required to make six PEG solutions e.g., for 6 tubes containing 4.9, 5.0, 5,1, 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1 mg mPEG-SVA one needs (4.9+5.0+5.1+4.9+5.0+5.1)×8=240 μl of K_2S O_4 . Based on the calculated minimal volume, prepare sufficient amount of 0.5% biotin-PEG-SVA solution in 0.5 M K_2S O_4 (e.g., dissolve 1.3m g of biotin-PEG-SVA with 260 ~sharp~Gamma0.5GammaM K_2SO_4) . Pipet the pre-calculated volumes of the 0.5% biotin-PEG-SVA solution into each of the 6 mPEG-SVA aliquots (e. g. add 39.2~ul to the 4.9 mg tube, and so on), vortex for 10 sec, and briefly spin with a tabletop centrifuge. Each tube now should have a clear solution and a small ^5u1 in volume) pellet of PEG on the bottom.Note: PEG precipitation is expected, because the PEG solution is currently at 11.6% concentration (w/v), which is above its ‘cloud point’ (10%w/v) .The tubes can remain at room temperature for at least 1 h without appreciable hydrolysis of the NHS group while the coverslips are being treated with APTES and laid out for PEGylation.16. With all APTES-treated coverslips laid out for PEGylation, set up the PEGylation reactions using one PEG-NHS aliquot at a time. To that end, add 1/8 of 1 M NaHCO3 (p H9.0) to the PEG solution in K_2S O_4 (e.g. add 4.9ul of NaHCO3 to a tube that originally contained a 4.9 mg mPEG-SVA aliquot, and now contains 39.2~ul of the biotin-PEGSVA solution), quickly mix by pipetting up and down, and deposit the whole solution in the center of a dry APTES-treated coverslip. Cover the drop with another coverslip carefully, making sure that the scored surfaces of both coverslips face towards the PEG solution, and avoiding formation of bubbles (by practicing). Repeat for the rest five pairs of coverslip and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Note: The PEG solution appears clear after addition of NaHCO3, because the total PEG concentration is now just below the ‘cloud point’. We noticed that additional coating of coverslips with a fresh solution of PEG does not improve the quality of surfaces (in terms of non-specific adsorption of biomolecules).17. Carefully separate the coverslip pairs using tweezers and place individual coverslips back into the ceramic rack in the double-distilled water. Rinse extensively with water until there is no more foaming of the solution.Quality control: Density of PEG molecules. You can estimate the packing density of the PEG molecules on the glass surface by depositing fluorescein-PEG-NHS in the same conditions as described above, and measuring the absorbance at 494 nm using a highsensitivity double-beam spectrophotometer (e.g., Perkin Elmer Lambda 35). The molecules density =(O D_494/e). xtinction coefficient) × 6.02× 10^23 m o l^-1, area. By this estimation, the average packing density should be consistent with the radius of gyration of a M_w=5,000 PEG molecule at cloud point R=2.8n m (Dalsin et al., 2005).# E.  Blocking of unreacted amines with acetyl groupsNote: Due to the bulkiness of PEG molecules, only a fraction of amine groups on the surface reacts with NHS-PEG. As a result, the remaining amines contribute to non-specific adsorption of negatively charged molecules, such as DNA, which is problematic in buffers of low ionic strengths. Thus, we cap the unreacted amines with NHS-acetate to convert them to neutral, stable amides.18. Blow-dry 12 PEGylated coverslips as described in step C12. Place dry coverslips on Parafilm, with the PEGylated surface facing up.19. Immediately prior to use, dissolve 3 mg of sulfo-NHS-acetate in 300~ul of 0.1 M NaHCO3 (p H9.0) , deposit 50~ul drops of the solution onto the 6 PEG coverslips, and cover with the remaining 6 coverslips, with the PEGylated surface facing the solution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Rinse coverslips with double-distilled water, blow-dry, and store dry at -80~^°C .F.  Testing fluorescent background of PEGylated surfaces and non-specific absorption of biomoleculesNote: The following protocol is for a rapid test of non-specific ‘stickiness’ of the surface to fluorescently labeled biomolecules. However, this test does not address the biological activity of surface-immobilized molecules (for instance, the activity of a transcription factor on a surface-immobilized DNA). Thus, the most relevant test of surface quality is a biochemical assay of the activity of surface-bound biomolecule, performed side-by-side with a positive control in which the activity of the same amount of biomolecules is measured in solution-based conditions (Revyakin et al., 2012).20. Create 5 open wells on a coverslip using 1 mm-wide strips of double-sided tape (by simply sticking 6 strips on to the modified side), and place the coverslip on an objectivetype TIRF microscope. The 5 wells allow testing of 5 different biomolecules.21. Deposit a 5~ul drop of PBST into a well, turn on the excitation laser, and focus the microscope onto the surface. Acquire a movie to measure the fluorescent background on the surface, under single-molecule imaging conditions (e.g., excitation with 532 and 640 nm sources at density 0.5k W/c m^2 , imaging in 580/60 nm and 670/45 nm optical bands, sampling rate 2.5H z ). In our hands, silanization and PEGylation increase the number of fluorescent background spots 3 fold in comparison to Piranha-treated glass (i.e., an increase from 3 spots to 10 spots per 100×100~um field of view), which is an acceptable level of background for most single-molecule imaging experiments. Allow the background spots to photobleach.22. Prepare a 10 nM solution of the fluorescently labeled test protein in PBST, and deposit 20~ul of the solution on top of the 5ul PBST drop already in the well. Acquire a movie to quantify the non-specific adsorption of the molecule to the surface. For simplicity, in this test we do not supply oxygen scavenger to the solution of test protein. Thus, to avoid immediate photobleaching upon sticking of a molecule to the surface (which will lead to over-estimation of surface quality) use minimal laser power (30100 W/c m^2) and fluorescent labels that photobleach in >5 seconds in the absence of oxygen scavengers (e.g., Cy3 and Atto633). For a good-quality surface, we typically observe a ‘cloud’ of 10 nM biomolecules rapidly diffusing in the bulk solution (at 2.5 H z acquisition rate), and 10 single-molecule limited spots in any given movie frame ( 100×100 um field of view). No additional accumulation of spots should be observed within 10 m i n (with the excitation light switched off, and then turned back on again), indicating that non-specific adsorption is rare and reversible. Repeat the test with other biomolecules of interest using the remaining 4 wells.# Recipes1.  0.5 M KOH (per liter) 28 g KOH Note: Solution can be re-used.2.  0.5 M K2SO4 (pH 6.0) (per liter) 174 g K2SO4 Note: Store at room temperature.

Igor software\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe protocols described here were developed for a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (_2A R) construct containing a thermo-stabilizing E122W mutation (Roth et al., 2008), C-terminal truncation at residue 348, deletion of residues 245 to 259 in the third intracellular loop (ICL3), a FLAG tag at the N-terminus and a 10× His tag at the C-terminus. The construct also contains C327S and C341S mutations, leaving just a single reactive cysteine residue (Cys265) for fluorophore labeling. The deletions, truncations and cysteine mutations do not disrupt binding of ligands to the receptor (Liu et al., 2012). The procedures to express the receptor in sf9 insect cells infected with high-titer recombinant virus are described elsewhere (Cherezov et al., 2008).A.  Receptor purification and Cy3 labeling1.  Lyse and wash frozen _2A R biomass (5 L, roughly 0.5 mg receptor/1 L biomass) using a 100ml glass tissue homogenizer. Cell lysis is chiefly achieved through the use of hypertonic (low salt) buffer and the mechanical force of homogenization. Wash lysed biomass with the low salt wash buffer and the high salt wash buffer 3 times, respectively ( 500~ml per wash). Use Beckman Ultra centrifuge to pellet membrane fragment suspension ( 158,000× g Ti45 rotor, 35 min, 4^°C_. ) in between washes. The washed membranes can be stored at -80~^°C for up to two weeks or 4~^°C overnight. Ideally, the washed membrane should be aliquoted, so that each aliquot of membranes contains roughly 0.5-1 mg of final purified receptor.2.  Treat one aliquot of washed membrane with 1 mM timolol (dissolved in ddH2O), 1 crushed Roche protease inhibitor tablet for 30 min at 4^°C . This step can be done by adding a previously prepared 100~m M timolol stock (stored at 4~^°C ) and crushed Roche inhibitor directly to the suspended membrane. Then, thoroughly mix the treated membrane with the solubilization buffer at 1:1 ratio for 3h at 4^°C .3.  Remove membrane pellet from supernatant using Beckman Ultra centrifuge (rotor Ti70) at 265,000 xg, , 35 min, 4^°C . Add stock 5 M NaCl, 4 M imidazole to the supernatant, so that the final concentration is 800 m M N a C l , 20~m M imidazole. Add 0.5 ml washed talon slurry to the supernatant and incubate at 4^°C overnight.4.  Pellet talon resin using Beckman X-12R centrifuge (or equivalent) at 500× g_: 1 min, 4^°C and remove supernatant. Wash with 50ml wash buffer 1, 10ml wash buffer 2, 10ml labeling buffer. Add 5ml labeling buffer on top of the pelleted resin, and 20ul of 5m g/m l (in DMSO) Cy3 stock (approximately 25uM final concentration, whereas the receptor concentration is approximately 1-5uM) . Incubate at 4^°C for 2 h in the dark.5.  Load talon resin onto an empty column and wash with 50~ml wash buffer 2 using gravity flow. Elute purified, labeled receptor using 1 ml fractions of elution buffer. Run SDS-PAGE to visualize the elution pattern. Concentrate Cy3-labeled receptors using a 100 kDa MWCO vivaspin2 concentrator.# B.  Nanodisc preparation1.  Mix labeled receptor, purified MSP1 and phospholipid mixture at a molar ratio 1:10:700 in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. The phospholipid mixture contains POPC, POPS and biotinyl Cap PE in the ratio 67.5% , 27.5% , and 5% . Add Bio-Bead resin and incubate overnight at 4^°C .2.  Remove Bio-Bead resin by pelleting. Purify nanodiscs by size exclusion chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column and SEC elution buffer. Representative elution profiles of membrane protein-nanodisc complexes are presented elsewhere (Ritchie et al., 2009). Remove empty nanodiscs by immobilized metal affinitychromatography (IMAC) using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, Ni column and IMAC elution buffer. Exchange buffer to the final buffer using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Note: Ni-NTA and talon (C o^2+) resins are both used to purify the receptor protein with poly-histidine tag, but differ in that 1) Nj^2+ has greater affinity for histidine, conferring a larger binding capacity per ml of resin, whereas 2) G o^2+ has greater selectivity toward histidine. As such talon resins are preferable to be used on crude lysate, as described in step A3 above, whereas Ni-NTA is preferable for the final purification step described here.C.  Surface immobilization of receptor-nanodisc complexes1.  Clean quartz slides and cover slips, passivate the surfaces with polyethylene glycol 5% biotinylated), as described previously (Lamichhane et al., 2010).2.  Prepare a microfluidic channel about 4-5m m wide on the quartz slide using double sided tape, fix cover slip on top of the double sided tape and close the two ends of channel using silicon grease at the time of experiment (Figure 2). This device is subsequently referred to as the sample chamber.()Double-SidedFigure 2. Illustration of the microfluidic sample chamber. Buffers or sample solutions are introduced through the entrance port via a pipette tip, as shown. Any excess solution flows out of the exit port, as shown.3.  Fill the sample chamber with 0.2m g/m l neutravidin and incubate for five minutes followed by final buffer wash.4.  Fill the sample chamber with 100~ul of receptor-nanodisc complexes (approximately 1 nM concentration), incubate for 10 m i n to allow complexes (containing 5% biotinylated lipids) to bind to neutravidin on the surface, then flush the chamber with imaging buffer.D.  Single-molecule fluorescence data acquisition1.  A microscope capable of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) measurements, equipped with a 532n m (green) laser for excitation (prism-based or objective-based illumination) and an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) camera capable of detecting the fluorescence emission from single fluorophores (Berezhna et al., 2012) is used to record a TIRF image of the surface at regular time intervals (e.g., every 100 msec or shorter, depending on the frame timeCopyright  2017 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.of the CCD camera) for a total period of at least 100 sec. Many discrete fluorescent spots should be visible in the image, each representing individual receptor-nanodisc complexes (Figure 3A).2.  Add a ligand, such as the agonist formoterol or inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (1 mM), to the sample chamber, allow ligand to interact with receptor (30 min to 1 h) and repeat the data acquisition. Alternatively, prepare a new sample chamber containing a pre-incubated mixture of receptor-nanodisc complexes and ligand.3.  As a control to test for non-specific binding, add receptor-nanodisc complexes to a surface lacking neutravidin. Very few fluorescent spots should be visible on the surface (Figure 3B).()Figure 3. TIRF images of immobilized receptor-nanodisc complexes and representative time trace for a single receptor-nanodisc complex (reproduced from Lamichhane et al., 2015). A. Typical TIRF image showing a 5×5um region (approximate dimensions) of immobilized Cy3-labeled _2A R reconstituted in nanodiscs. Each spot is due to the fluorescence emitted from an individual receptor-nanodisc complex. The very bright spots are due to a small fraction of receptor-nanodisc aggregates, which are readily identified and excluded from the data analysis. B. Corresponding TIRF image for a control surface lacking neutravidin. The number of fluorescent spots is greatly reduced relative to part A, indicating a negligible level of non-specific adsorption of receptor-nanodisc complexes. C. Representative fluorescence intensity versus time trace from a single nanodisc-bound receptor, showing repeated two-state intensity jumps prior to an irreversible photobleaching event. The red line is the best fit from Hidden Markov modeling. The single-step photobleaching transition confirms that a single receptor molecule is contained within the nanodisc.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Receptor Construct Description\nThe beta 2 adrenergic receptor construct contains a thermo-stabilizing E122W mutation, C-terminal truncation at residue 348, deletion of residues 245 to 259 in the third intracellular loop, a FLAG tag at the N-terminus, and a 10× His tag at the C-terminus.\nThe construct also contains C327S and C341S mutations, leaving just a single reactive cysteine residue for fluorophore labeling.\nThe deletions, truncations, and cysteine mutations do not disrupt binding of ligands to the receptor.\n## Receptor Purification and Cy3 Labeling\n## Lysis and Washing of Biomass\nLyse and wash frozen beta 2 adrenergic receptor biomass using a 100ml glass tissue homogenizer.\nWash lysed biomass with low salt wash buffer and high salt wash buffer three times, respectively.\nUse Beckman Ultra centrifuge to pellet membrane fragment suspension in between washes.\n## Treatment with Timolol and Protease Inhibitor\nTreat one aliquot of washed membrane with 1 mM timolol and 1 crushed Roche protease inhibitor tablet for 30 min at 4°C.\nThoroughly mix the treated membrane with the solubilization buffer at a 1:1 ratio for 3h at 4°C.\n## Removal of Membrane Pellet and Addition of NaCl and Imidazole\nRemove membrane pellet from supernatant using Beckman Ultra centrifuge.\nAdd stock 5 M NaCl and 4 M imidazole to the supernatant to achieve final concentrations of 800 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole.\n## Talon Resin Binding and Washing\nAdd 0.5 ml washed talon slurry to the supernatant and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nPellet talon resin using Beckman X-12R centrifuge and remove supernatant.\nWash with 50ml wash buffer 1, 10ml wash buffer 2, and 10ml labeling buffer.\n## Cy3 Labeling\nAdd 5ml labeling buffer and 20ul of 5mg/ml Cy3 stock to the pelleted resin and incubate at 4°C for 2h in the dark.\nLoad talon resin onto an empty column and wash with 50ml wash buffer 2 using gravity flow.\nElute purified, labeled receptor using 1 ml fractions of elution buffer and concentrate using a 100 kDa MWCO vivaspin2 concentrator.\n## Nanodisc Preparation\n## Mixing of Labeled Receptor, MSP1, and Phospholipid Mixture\nMix labeled receptor, purified MSP1, and phospholipid mixture at a molar ratio of 1:10:700 in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.\nAdd Bio-Bead resin and incubate overnight at 4°C.\n## Purification of Nanodiscs\nRemove Bio-Bead resin by pelleting.\nPurify nanodiscs by size exclusion chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system and superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column.\nRemove empty nanodiscs by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system and Ni column.\n## Buffer Exchange\nExchange buffer to the final buffer using a PD-10 desalting column.\n## Surface Immobilization of Receptor-Nanodisc Complexes\n## Cleaning and Passivation of Quartz Slides and Cover Slips\nClean quartz slides and cover slips.\nPassivate the surfaces with polyethylene glycol (5% biotinylated).\n## Preparation of Microfluidic Channel\nPrepare a microfluidic channel about 4-5mm wide on the quartz slide using double-sided tape.\nFix cover slip on top of the double-sided tape and close the two ends of the channel using silicon grease.\n## Immobilization of Receptor-Nanodisc Complexes\nFill the sample chamber with 0.2mg/ml neutravidin and incubate for five minutes.\nFill the sample chamber with 100ul of receptor-nanodisc complexes and incubate for 10min to allow complexes to bind to neutravidin on the surface.\n## Single-Molecule Fluorescence Data Acquisition\n## TIRF Microscopy\nUse a microscope capable of total internal reflection fluorescence measurements to record a TIRF image of the surface at regular time intervals.\nAdd a ligand, such as the agonist formoterol or inverse agonist ICI 118,551, to the sample chamber and repeat the data acquisition.\n## Control Experiment\nAdd receptor-nanodisc complexes to a surface lacking neutravidin as a control to test for non-specific binding.","evidence_ids":["Protocol.io-1321","Bio-protocol-3353","Protocol.io-5515","Bio-protocol-1854","Bio-protocol-1996","Bio-protocol-1603","Bio-protocol-3860","Bio-protocol-3940","Protocol.io-8616","Bio-protocol-588"]}

After 10 days of incubation the CAM is dropping and tumor cells (green) are applied to it. After allowing xenografted tumor cells to grow, the tumor and chicken tissues are harvested on day 5-7 for Alu PCR.1.  Preparing the eggs for xenografting tumor cells a.  Freshly fertilized chicken eggs are incubated on their side in a rotating incubator at 37~^°C and 60% humidity for 10 days. The eggs are rotated three times per hour (Figures 2.1 and 2.2)b.  On day 10 the eggs are placed on their side on an egg rack (Figure 2.3). Use a tube lamp or other suitable light source to candle the eggs by shining the light at the blunt end of the egg where the air sack is located. The embryo must be located near the bottom of the egg and the air sack on its right. Localize and mark using a pencil the allantoic vein that is located at the top of the eggshell, right where several blood vessels cross (Figure 2.4).c.  Clean the area, including and around the mark, using a cotton swab soaked with iodine (Figure 2.5).d.  Drill a small hole through the eggshell into the air sack using a 30-gauge syringe needle (Figures 2.6 and 3A).e.  Make another hole near the allantoic vein, which penetrates the shell membrane but not the CAM, using a Dremel rotary tool kit (Figures 2.7 and 3B). The CAM is attached to the inner surface of the shell, so care should be exercised at this point. Use a 20-gauge syringe needle with a small hook on the end to make a third very small hole in the eggshell membrane (Figure 3C, Note 1).()Figure 2. A serial depiction of the model. 1 and 2. Incubate the eggs; 3. Prepare a clean area and set all the materials; 4. Mark the location of the allantoic vein; 5. Apply iodine using a cotton swab; 6 and 7. Drill holes in the eggshell; 8. Drop the CAM; 9. Cut an opening for tumor cell grafting; 10. Apply the tumor cells and wait for 5 min; 11. Seal the hole using laboratory tape; 12. Incubate the eggs.f.  To suction, create with an automatic pipette aid fitted with a piece of Tygon tubing placed against the hole in the airsac. To separate the CAM from the shell and let it drop, apply a mild vacuum to the hole over the air sack so the blood vessel drops down, away from the eggshell and attaches to the embryo (Figures 2.8 and 3D).g.  Use a cut off wheel (Dremel) to cut a square window (1Omegac m^2) approximately 0.5 cm away from the branch point in the vein to expose the underlying CAM. A pair of needle-nose forceps can be used to remove a small section of eggshell in the square window and expose the CAM (Figures 2.9 and 3E).h.  Once the CAM is dropped, seal the hole located near the chorioallantoic vein using laboratory tape.i.  Then place the eggs in an egg rack into a stationary incubator at 37~^°C and 60% humidity in anticipation for grafting the tumor cells.()Figure 3. A six panel diagram illustrating the appearance of the chick embryo metastasis model in cross section at key steps. A. After 10 days of incubation, the allantoic vein is positioned against the top of the egg. Drill one hole in the eggshell into the air sack using a 30 G syringe needle. B. Make another hole using a Dremel rotary tool kit adjacent to the attachment point for the allantoic vein. C. Make a third small hole in the eggshell membrane using a _20 G syringe needle. D. Apply a mild vacuum into the hole over the air sack to evacuate the air and drop the CAM. E. Cut a square window (1c m^2) using a Dremel cut off wheel and remove a small section of eggshell to expose the CAM. F. Graft the tumor cells onto the CAM.2.  Preparing tumor cells for graftinga.  Detach tumor cells from their culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice in order to remove any residual media.b.  Cells are counted using a Neubauer chamber and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at 40 million cells/ml depending on the cell line used (Note 2).3.  Grafting the tumor cells onto the CAMUsing a 20-200 μl pipette place 25~ul of the cell suspension onto a small area of the CAM (Figures 2.10 and 3F). The optimal number of cells should be determined empirically, but can range from 0.4~×~10^5 to 2 × 10^6 depending on the growth and ‘invasiveness’ characteristics of the tumor cell line used. Different tumors and cell suspensions derived from tumors have been implanted on the CAM (Tables 1 and 2). Tumor cell lines grow and intravasate to the vasculature with different efficiencies. For instance, suspensions of A375 melanoma (1×10^6) , SKMEL2 melanoma (1×10^6) , RKO colorectal carcinoma (2×10^6) , HCT116 (0.5×10^6) , U87 glioblastoma (0.2×10^6) , PC3 prostate carcinoma (1×10^6) , Hep3 epidermoid carcinoma (0.4×10^6) , HT-1080 fibrosarcom (0.5×10^6) cell lines; have been grafted on the CAM of embryonated chicken eggs. All cell lines tested formed 4-8 mm size tumors, which recapitulated hallmarks of corresponding human specimens. Depending on the tissue origin, number of tumor cells and their proliferation capacity, primary CAM tumors can reach up to 500-600 mg in 6-7 days after cell inoculation.b.  Seal the window in the egg tightly with laboratory tape and leave the eggs in a position with the embryos standing upright for 5-10 min, in order to allow the cells to settle (Figure 2.11).c.  After 10 min, return the eggs to the stationary incubator (Figure 2.12).d.  Allow cells to grow for 5-7 days depending on the nature of the tumor cell line used. This time should be enough for a macroscopic tumor to be visible.e.  The CAM model allow experimental studies of potential anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic compounds. Tumors can be treated topically on the upper CAM with potential anti-cancer drugs. For instance, to evaluate the effects of DEL22379 in A375 and RKO tumor growth we inoculated tumor cells on the CAM and incubate the embryos for 4 days at 37~^°C and 60% humidity. Then, we added 10~uM DEL22379 (prepare freshly, soluble in DMSO) topically on the CAM and treatment was refreshed every 12h . Two days later tumors were harvested.# Table 1.

The chick chorioallantoic membrane as an in vivo xenograft model to study tumor growth and metastasis()Harvesting tumors and chick embryo tissues a.  Perform dissections in an area free of contaminating DNA (Figure 4.1). To detect metastatic invasion this assay quantifies the presence of ectopic DNA in chicken organs using a highly sensitive PCR approach. Therefore, it is very important to prevent contamination with exogenous DNA.b.  In order not to have cross-contamination of your samples, use three separated sets of surgery tools. One set for cutting the egg, one set for harvesting the primary tumor and one set for removing the internal tissues.c.  Prepare three wash containers for sequential rinsing of the tools between each animal and change their liquid between different experimental groups. Sequentially these washes are: distilled water, 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.d.  Get the eggs from the stationary incubator.e.  Open a new window removing some of the eggshell such that the tumors become visible. At this point, you can take some pictures of the appearance of the macroscopic tumor (Figures 4-6).f.  Resect the primary tumor from the CAM and weigh the tumor.g.  Remove the chick embryo from the eggshell by cutting the shell radially into equal halves.()Figure 4. Pictures showing tumor and chicken tissues harvest. 1. Perform dissection in a clean area. 2. Open a new window removing some of the eggshell and resect the primary tumor from the CAM. 3. Cut the eggshell radially into equal halves and harvest lower CAM. 4. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum and collect a piece of liver.h.  Transfer the embryo to a clean weight boat. The animal must be dissected using a clean set of tools.i. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum. Once the embryo is open, collect a piece of the liver. To harvest the lung, cut the rib cage and separate from the breast.j. Harvested samples can be processed immediately for DNA isolation or stored at -80~^°C for later extraction of DNA, if necessary.()HCT116 SKMEL 2Figure 5. Different tumors have been implanted on the CAM. Tumors were formed using 0.5 x 10^6 HCT116 colorectal cancer cells or 1×10^6 SKMEL2 melanoma cells during 5 and 7 days respectively.# 5.  Genomic DNA isolationa.  To extract genomic DNA from tissues, we use the DNA kit from Qiagen. Purified DNA following manufacturer’s instructions. DNA can be used immediately or stored at -20~^°C . Dilute the DNA 1:50 or 1:25 to get 30 n g/u l in nuclease free water before using it for the PCR reaction.# 6.  PCR analysisa.  To detect human tumor cell DNA in the chick tissues we use quantitative PCR for human Alu sequences using Alu-specific primers and SYBR green mix amplification kit. Prepare the reaction mix in a final volume of 10ul , with 0.4~uM of each primer. Optimize the amount of template DNA empirically, we usually use 30 ng. Use chicken GAPDH primers as an internal control. The PCR is run under the following conditions: 95~^°C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95^°C for 30 sec, 63^°C for 30 sec, 72^°C for 30 sec.b.  Generate a standard curve using a dilution series of human DNA (10^2,10^3,10^4) from the original tumor cells. Use this standard curve to quantify human tumor cells in a chick embryonic metastasis assay.c.  Measure Ct values in triplicate and against the standard curve calculate the number of tumor cells in each CAM and liver sample.d.  Invaded cells are detected using either 30 ng of 50 ng of total CAM DNA. Use water as a negative control.e.  To evaluate results and statistical significance of control and experimental groups, use Graph Pad Prism software and Student t-test or ANOVA analysis (Figure 6).()Figure 6. DEL 22379 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Tumors were formed using 1×10^6 A375 p melanoma cells (A) or 2×10^6 R K O colorectal cancer cells (B). Cells were applied to the CAM of day-10 embryos. Four days after applying the tumor cells half of the embryos were treated with DMSO and the other half with DEL22379 (10 uM) . Two days later tumors were harvested to weigh. CAM and chick organs (lung) were harvested from embryos bearing tumors and subjected to quantitative Alu PCR. Conversely, quantitative PCR of chGAPDH was used as an internal control to confirm the presence of equivalent quantities of host genomic DNA. Data shows average pm SEM from 3 independent experiments. ^P<0.05 ; ^P<0.005 , by unpaired Student t-test (Herrero et al., 2015).# Notes1.  A small hook on the end of the _20 G syringe needle is necessary to make the third hole in the eggshell membrane. Try to do it very softly and carefully not to tear the underlying CAM. 2.  Place the tube on ice during the experiment to avoid the formation of clusters of tumor cells.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to the Spontaneous Metastasis Assay\nA schematized summary of the spontaneous metastasis assay is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe chick embryo for spontaneous metastasis model is used to study tumor growth and metastasis.\n## Preparing the Eggs for Xenografting Tumor Cells\nFreshly fertilized chicken eggs are incubated on their side in a rotating incubator at 37°C and 60% humidity for 10 days.\n## Egg Preparation\nThe eggs are rotated three times per hour.\nOn day 10, the eggs are placed on their side on an egg rack.\nUse a tube lamp or other suitable light source to candle the eggs by shining the light at the blunt end of the egg where the air sack is located.\n## Marking the Allantoic Vein\nLocalize and mark using a pencil the allantoic vein that is located at the top of the eggshell, right where several blood vessels cross.\nClean the area, including and around the mark, using a cotton swab soaked with iodine.\n## Drilling Holes in the Eggshell\nDrill a small hole through the eggshell into the air sack using a 30-gauge syringe needle.\nMake another hole near the allantoic vein, which penetrates the shell membrane but not the CAM, using a Dremel rotary tool kit.\nMake a third small hole in the eggshell membrane using a 20-gauge syringe needle with a small hook on the end.\n## Dropping the CAM\nApply a mild vacuum to the hole over the air sack to evacuate the air and drop the CAM.\nCut a square window (1 cm^2) using a Dremel cut-off wheel and remove a small section of eggshell to expose the CAM.\n## Preparing Tumor Cells for Grafting\nDetach tumor cells from their culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice.\nCells are counted using a Neubauer chamber and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at 40 million cells/ml.\nDetermine the optimal number of cells to be grafted, which can range from 0.4 × 10^5 to 2 × 10^6 depending on the growth and 'invasiveness' characteristics of the tumor cell line used.\n## Grafting the Tumor Cells onto the CAM\nPlace 25 μl of the cell suspension onto a small area of the CAM using a 20-200 μl pipette.\nSeal the window in the egg tightly with laboratory tape and leave the eggs in a position with the embryos standing upright for 5-10 min.\nAllow cells to grow for 5-7 days depending on the nature of the tumor cell line used.\n## Harvesting Tumors and Chick Embryo Tissues\nPerform dissections in an area free of contaminating DNA.\n## Dissection and Harvesting\nUse three separated sets of surgery tools to prevent cross-contamination of samples.\nPrepare three wash containers for sequential rinsing of the tools between each animal.\nGet the eggs from the stationary incubator and open a new window removing some of the eggshell to expose the tumors.\n## Resecting the Primary Tumor and Harvesting Organs\nResect the primary tumor from the CAM and weigh the tumor.\nRemove the chick embryo from the eggshell by cutting the shell radially into equal halves.\nHarvest the liver and lung from the chick embryo.\n## Genomic DNA Isolation\nExtract genomic DNA from tissues using the DNA kit from Qiagen.\nPurified DNA following manufacturer’s instructions and dilute the DNA 1:50 or 1:25 to get 30 ng/μl in nuclease-free water.\n## PCR Analysis\nDetect human tumor cell DNA in the chick tissues using quantitative PCR for human Alu sequences.\n## PCR Reaction\nPrepare the reaction mix in a final volume of 10 μl, with 0.4 μM of each primer.\nOptimize the amount of template DNA empirically, usually using 30 ng.\nUse chicken GAPDH primers as an internal control.\n## Data Analysis\nGenerate a standard curve using a dilution series of human DNA.\nMeasure Ct values in triplicate and calculate the number of tumor cells in each CAM and liver sample.\nEvaluate results and statistical significance of control and experimental groups using Graph Pad Prism software and Student t-test or ANOVA analysis.","evidence_ids":["Protocol-exchange-831","Protocol.io-23","Bio-protocol-436","Protocol-exchange-158","Protocol-exchange-132","Protocol.io-6486","Bio-protocol-828","Protocol.io-2226","Bio-protocol-536","Protocol.io-1079"]}

Growth and synchronization of transgenic C. elegans population1.  When working with a transgenic strain with integrated genetic array (Table 1), use a sterile pipette tip (200u//) to cut a small chunk (0.5×0.5:cm) ) of agar containing animals from an older plate and transfer it to a freshly Escherichia coli (OP50) seeded NGM plate (see Recipes). When working with a transgenic line with a non-integrated extrachromosomal array, pick 25 L4 larvae or adult transgenic animals based on the selection-marker to a freshly OP50 seeded NGM plate.2.  Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of ^20^°C .3.  3.5 days later the plates contain a mixed population of larval stages.4.  Synchronize nematodes by picking 30 transgenic animals in L4 stage under a dissecting stereomicroscope and transfer them onto separate OP50 seeded plates. The L4 stage can be identified based on the presence of a half-moon shaped light structure in the area of the vulva and the relative size of the animal (Figure 1).5.  Grow the animals for 24~h at ^20^°C into day 1 adults and proceed with mounting the sample (Procedure B).()Figure 1. Identification of C. elegans larval stages in a mixed population. The image depicts all 4 larval stages, young adult and day 1 adult as seen under a dissecting stereomicroscope. The arrow indicates the half-moon shaped structure in the area of the vulva, which is indicative for the L4 larval stage.B.  Mounting animals for imaging1.  Prepare fresh 5% agarose pads (see Recipes).2.  Pipette 3ul polystyrene beads suspension in the center of the agarose pad.3.  Use a platinum wire to pick 30 transgenics from the OP50 seeded plates into the polystyrene bead suspension.4.  Gently place a coverslip on top of the agarose/worm suspension and proceed with the imaging procedure. Optionally, the agarose pads can be sealed with nail polish, which will retain humidity for long-term (>3h) imaging.5.  Animals can be recovered from unsealed plates by gently lifting one edge of the coverslip with the help of a scalpel and adding 10ul of M9 buffer to suspend the worms. Subsequently, worms can be transferred with an eyelash to OP50-seeded NGM plates.C.  Imaging P body/SG number with an epifluorescence light microscope1.  Start up the light microscope and imaging software (ZEN, Zeiss).2.  Place the agarose pad on the imaging stage of the fluorescent light microscope and locate the animals. Use a 10x objective to image the whole animal.3.  Use the DIC channel to focus on an anatomical landmark. Most appropriate are the grinder and the lumen of the pharynx, which are located in the most central transverse (horizontal) position within the animal (Figure 2A).4.  Change to the fluorescent channel to visualize P body or SG-specific fluorescence and define exposure time and fluorescent light intensity. These parameters depend on the transgene and have to be defined empirically. Saturation of the fluorescent signal has to be avoided by lowering exposure time and/or fluorescent light intensity. However, too short exposure might result in# bio-protocollowered sensitivity of detecting RNP granules (Figure 2B). For transgenes that co-express various reporters for P bodies/SGs repeat this step in the corresponding fluorescent channel.5.  Once the best imaging conditions are determined, take a snapshot of all fluorescent channels and the DIC channel. Take images of at least 25 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.6.  Save the data as an image stack. Zeiss microscopes produce *.czi file formats, which can be processed by ImageJ/Fiji freeware (see Data analysis). However, images can also be stored/exported and further processed in any other common format including *.jpg, *.png, *.tiff, etc., and then proceed with the data analysis.()Figure 2.

Images were recorded with an Axio Imager Z2 through a 10× magnification objective. Size bars are 100um . A. DIC image. The inlay shows a digitally enhanced view on the pharynx. The arrow points out the grinder, which has to be in focus before switching to the fluorescent channel. B. Fluorescent image of the P body reporter DCAP-1::dsRED. C. Screenshot of image processing. Choose the polygon selection tool to surround the whole animal. Open Analyze > Measure to get area size and MPI. (Full genotype of transgenic animal: N2;Expdcap-1DCAP-1::dsRED; pRF4 published in Rieckher et al., 2015.)D.  Imaging P body/SG number, dynamics and colocalization with a confocal microscope1.  Start up the confocal microscope and corresponding imaging software.2.  Activate the appropriate laser(s) for fluorescent detection of P body/SG reporters.3.  Locate the animal through the eyepiece with a 10x objective using transmission light and center the field of view on the area of interest (e.g., the pharynx).4.  Upon localization, switch to the 40× objective and readjust the focus.5.  In the confocal operating software (acquisition) design a protocol for a z-stack scan. a.  Different RNP granules significantly vary in size and intensity across different transgenes and within samples (Teixeira et al., 2005). Hence, a balance has to be established empirically between laser power and gain (voltage of photomultiplier tubes PMTs/detectors) to set the highest and lowest detection limit. If available, use the Smart Setup as a starting point. Try to avoid overexposure but test the lower detection limit by stepwise increasing laser power and/or gain. The final settings have to be reproducibly applied to all samples.For the example in Figure 2 we use the tunable laser at 570 n m (excitation dsRED), laser power 3% , and Master gain 580.b.  Keep the pinhole size for an optimal section thickness at 1 AU.c.  The distance between z-stacks (slices) should be maximum 1.5 um . Decreasing z-stack distance might enhance the capability to detect smaller RNP granules but increases photobleaching. Cover a similar volume in each scanned sample. We perform 30 z-stacks at 1.5um across the pharyngeal region (Figures 2 and 3).d.  Assign the frame size (resolution). We use 1024×1024 (Figures 2 and 3).e.  Use the transmitted light detector (T-PMT) to produce a DIC/Brightfield image in parallel (optional).6.  Once the best imaging conditions are determined, perform a scan of the fluorescent channel. When imaging different P bodies/SGs co-expressed in the same transgene use sequential scan for additional fluorescent channels. Take datasets of at least 15 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.7.  Upon completion of the scan use the processing mode of the ZEN software to produce a maximum intensity projection (MIP), summarizing the fluorescence intensity of all stacks in one image (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistently save as *.czi file or other image file format. Proceed with data analysis. Alternatively, single stacks or subsets of stacks can be processed and analyzed.()Figure 3 Representative images of the pharyngeal region of an adult transgenic animal expressing the P body reporter DCAP-1::dsRED and the SG reporter IFE-2::GFP.

Chicken egg manipulation and incubationWilmington) (Note 1) or White Leghorn chicken eggs (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) are stored at room temperature up to 5 days without significant decrease in viability 80-85% viability) or defects in development (Note 2).2.  Before incubating the eggs, check the conditions of the incubator (Note 3).3.  For electroporations in the eye, we incubate the eggs approximately 35~h~ for Stages8-9 (seven somites, the anterior neural folds closes to form the neural tube), 38 h for Stage 10 (ten somites, optic vesicles not constricted at bases), 48 h for Stage 12 (sixteen somites, optic vesicle and optic stalk established), 72h for Stage 14 (optic vesicle evaginated and lens-placode present) or 4.5 days for Stage 22 eye pigmented, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and neuroepithelium well established (Note 4).()Figure 2. Stage 8-12 electrodes set up. Two isolated Pt/Ir electrodes with Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 m m of free tip (a) are bent as is indicated (b). Thereafter, the bent electrodes are inserted into a small plastic holder (made from a 20ul pipet tip) with 2 mm diameter (c1) and 3 m m length (c2) keeping at the tip 1.5m m in between (c). The electrodes are inserted into the holder made of Stainless Steel Tube (SST) and Resin Rod (RR) that has been modified with a press fit (d). Carefully, electrodes are permanently attached to the holder using epoxy. It is critical to keep the shape and 1.5~m m distance between the electrodes during this procedure (e). Finally, the Pt/Ir electrodes are connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator.()Figure 3. Stage 19-26 electrodes set up.

One Pt/Ir microelectrode (cathode -) is isolated using Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 mm of free tip (see Figure 2a) and inserted into a glass capillary tube and sealed with epoxy (b), that can be alternatively protected with a 1ml pipet tip. The assembled electrodes are then connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator (c).# B.  Electroporations at Stages 8-12a.  Fertilized eggs are incubated horizontally on their sides so the embryo can be properly positioned for electroporation (Figure 4a). If electroporation is planned for more than one dozen, we strongly suggest to space out the incubation times for each dozen in order to have enough time to electroporate the next dozen at the same developmental stage. This is particularly critical for Stages 8 to 12. Once the embryos reach the desired Stage (approximately 38 h for Stage 10, see Chicken egg manipulation and incubation), proceed to open the eggs according with the instructions provided in the Video 1 (steps B1e-h below). It takes about 2 min to open each egg. The electroporation can be made immediately after opening the egg, however if you have enough experience opening the eggs you can open one dozen in about 25 min and then proceed with the electroporation immediately.b.  Once the eggs reach the desired stage, place them in a carton and at room temperature for about 10 min. This incubation is necessary to facilitate the contraction of the inner shell membrane and promotes the separation from the outer shell membrane to generate the air sack.c.  Keeping their horizontal position, place the eggs in a small incubator (e,g., HOVA-BATOR) previously calibrated at 37-39 ^°C (99 to 103 ^°F ) and relative humidity of 50-55% .d.  With a bright light source, candle the egg and mark the area where the embryo is located, usually the embryo is located in the top part of the yolk (on the top of the horizontal section of the shell).e.  Mark the air sack that is located between the outer and inner membranes of the egg.f.  Pierce the shell at the top of the air sack using blunt ended forceps or a syringe with a large bore needle.g.  Carefully, introduce a fine probe to move the air sack to the top part of the egg, this is possible by gently touching down to lower the inner shell membrane (Figure 4b-c) (Note 5).h.  Using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (Figure 4d) (Video 1 provides visual information of the steps B1e-h) and add 200~ul of HBSS. Close the window using transparent tape and return the egg to the incubator. Discard the embryos older than the desired stage. If the embryos have not reached the desired stage, they can be incubated for an additional time.Variations on the embryonic stage in which the electroporation is performed will produce inconsistency on the results and interpretation.()Figure 4. Preparing eggs for electroporation. Fertilized eggs are incubated in horizontal position (a). After localizing the air sack and the chick embryo, a fine probe is introduced to move the air sack to the top part of the egg. This is possible by gently touching and lowering the inner shell membrane (b, c). Finally, using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (d).i. Optionally, to enhance the contrast and visualize the embryo at Stages 8-12, inject 100~ul of Indian ink solution diluted in HBSS using a 1 ml syringe and a 25-26 gauge needle underneath the embryo.j.  Repeat steps B1e-h for the rest of the eggs until the dozen is completed.()Video 1. Preparing the eggs for electroporation# 2.  Embryo electroporationa.  Adjust the nitrogen tank to 80 psi.b.  Attach the beveled glass capillary needle to the stainless steel pipette holder of the microinjector (Figure 1c).c.  Set the microinjector at 18-20 psi and perform a test loading HBSS using the “fill” button or the footswitch and release the solution pushing the button “empty” from the microinjector. Test the microinjection system using the Footswitch.d.  Attach the blue dichroic filter to the optical path of the Tungsten Halogen Light Source. Configure the electroporator with the following settings: Mode, LV; voltage, 18~or ; pulse length, 50~ms ; number of pulses, 5; pulse interval, 950~ms ; polarity, unipolar.e.  Connect  the  Stage-8-12  electrodes  (see  the  equipment  section)  to  the electroporator.f. Using a 35m m tissue culture plate, containing 1 ml of HBSS, check the electroporation system placing the electrodes in the solution (Note 9).g.  Using the footswitch from the microinjector, load the glass capillary needle with the experimental solution (Plasmid, RCAS constructs or MOs in the solutions section).h.  Add 100~ul of HBSS to the embryo to decrease the resistance between the electrodes.i.  For electroporations into the eye, inject 0.25~ul (20 microinjection pulses using a 20um of tip diameter glass capillary needle) of the solution into the anterior neural fold (anterior neuropore at Stage 8-9, Figure 5a) or into the optic vesicle (Stages 10-11, Figure 5b).j. Place the Stage 8-12 electrodes over the vitelline membrane (a clear membrane that is surrounding the egg yolk) in both sides of the embryo (parallel to the neural tube) (Figures 5a, b) and perform the electroporation using the electroporator footswitch.k.  Carefully, remove the electrodes and add an additional 100ul of HBSS.l.  Seal the window with plastic tape and transfer the eggs to the incubator until they reach the desired stage. A representative image of an electroporated embryo at Stage 11 using a control MO (Figure 5c, d), and one collected 3 days after is shown in Figure 5e.()Figure 5. Electroporations at Stages 8-12.

Check the electroporation system placing the electrodes (1 cm in between) in a 35mm tissue culture plate containing 1 ml of HBSS (Note 9).7.  Using  the  microinjector  footswitch,  load  the  glass  capillary  needle  with  theCopyright  2015 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.experimental solution (RCAS-DNA or morpholinos).8.  For electroporations in the eye, inject 0.5ul (40 microinjection pulses) into the eye cup at Stage 18-19 or 0.75ul (60 microinjection pulses) into the eye at Stage 24-25 using a 20um diameter tip glass capillary needle.9.  Add 200ul of HBSS to the embryo to decrease the resistance between the electrodes.10. To perform the electroporation, the gold plated electrode connected to the anode (+) is placed close to the ventro-temporal section of the eye and the cathode (-) electrode is inserted perpendicular to the head of the embryo (Video 2 essentially describes steps C8-10).# Video 2. Electroporation in the chick optic cup at Stages 19-26()11. Remove the electrodes carefully and add 200ul of HBSS.12.

For studies in which the RCAS replication-competent ASLV long terminal repeat (LTR) with a Splice acceptor virus system will be used, we strongly recommend to use Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) eggs. These eggs have been certified to be pathogen free  of  avian  sarcoma-leukosis  virus  (ASLV).  For  additional  information  see http://www.criver.com/, and a detailed study of endogenous expression of ASLV viral proteins has been published by McNally et al. (2010).2.  Temperatures below 4^°C are detrimental so special care is advised during shipping in winter season.3.  Eggs are incubated in a rotating incubator (45 angle rotation every hour) at 37-39^°C (99 to 103 ^°F_. ) and relative humidity of 50-55% . The incubation times and embryo stages could vary depending on the type of incubator, temperature and humidity, therefore the incubation times for specific embryonic stages should be determined empirically in each laboratory (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951).4.  Before performing the electroporation, make sure the embryo is at the desired stage, be aware of some characteristics such as number of somites, optic vesicle, lens-vesicle and eye pigmentation. Small differences in the stage of electroporation can result in tremendous differences in phenotypes. In some cases, an injection of Indian ink could be necessary in order to visualize the embryo and to familiarize with the structures (see step B1i of electroporations at Stages 8-12).5.  Be gentle when introducing the probe and avoid damage of the inner membranes of the egg. If you notice leaking of albumin is very probable that the embryo will die.6.  Ensure that the plasmid or RCAS constructs are of high quality. DNA constructs are amplified using commercial kits e.g., PureYield™ Plasmid Maxiprep System or Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Prep™ and dissolved in TE buffer (see TE buffer in the solutions section). We recommend dissolving the DNA at concentrations between 3.0-5.0~u/ulfor plasmids and 200n g/ul for RCAS constructs and store at -20~^°C for short-term use or at -80~^°C for long-term storage. Avoid using samples of DNA containing traces of Phenol or ethanol and high concentration of salts, since they could be detrimental for the  viability  of  the  embryo.  Determine  the  concentration  of  DNA  using  a spectrophotometer  or  a  Nanodrop.  Alternatively,  the  concentration  could  be determined using SYBR Green I dsDNA assay. The ratio of absorbance 260/280 will give you an idea about the purity of DNA vs protein or other contaminants and secondary  measurement  could  be  260/230  (phenol  carbohydrates  and  have absorbance  close  to  230nm)  (see  technical  support  bulletin  at http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/gcat/protocols/NanoDrop_tip.pdf). A ratio of 1.8 or above for 260/280 ratio or 2.0-2.2 for 260/230 are considered good quality DNA. Always verify the integrity of the DNA by electrophoresis. Quantification is not enough to ensure that your DNA is of good quality. For first time users, it is advisable to use plasmids containing a reporter gene such as GFP to evaluate the efficiency of electroporation, for example pCAG-GFP or pEGFP-N1. Additionally, in order to track the expression of your gene of interest it is recommendable to design your constructs to include an IRES-GFP sequence or an alternative way to identify the electroporated areas. To prepare the electroporation solution, mix 9.0~ul of plasmid (3.0-5.0~u9/uI) or RCAS-contruct (200n g/ul) with 1~ul of 0.05% Fast Green dye.7.  Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides are designed to down regulate gene expression.  They  can  be  designed  and  ordered  from  GeneTools  LLC (http://www.gene-tools.com/). In order to trace the electroporated cells, the MOs must be tagged at the acute° -end (e.g., carboxyfluorescein). MO have minimal off-target effects but it is recommendable to use at least two different MOs (e.g., to block translation and splice junctions) in order to observe the same phenotypic effects. Additionally, it is necessary to use a control MO and/or scrambled sequence of the target mRNA. The main disadvantages of using MOs is that they are very expensive and sometimes it is necessary to test more than two sequences in order to find the right MO to efficiently down regulate gene expression. Moreover, during cell division, MOs are diluted so they are inefficient for long term (more than 4 days) and in some cases they are practically  undetectable  after  72  h  of  electroporation  and  in  such  cases  the fluorescence signal needs to be detected using an antibody against fluorescein. MOs are dissolved at 1 mM concentration using sterile Ringer’s solution and stored at room temperature in the original container and kept in the dark. According with Gene Tools, MOs can precipitate at low temperatures and lose their efficiency, so they need to be resuspended again before use. During electroporation, MOs can migrate slightly towards the anode (+) possibly because of the fluorescein that is negatively charged. In order to increase the efficiency of MO electroporation, it is advisable to use 0.5u of DNA (e.g., non-biologically active plasmid). To prepare the electroporation solution, mix and heat an aliquot of 10ul at 65^°C for 10m i n to re-dissolve the precipitates. It isnot recommendable to use fast green since it can inhibit the electroporation (Kos et al.,2013). The injection of the carboxyfluorescein-tagged morpholino can be visualized using a blue dichroic filter attached to a regular fiber optic lamp.8.  We provided the list of parts necessary to set up Stage-8-12 and Stage-19-26 electrodes, notice that some of the parts listed could be the same.9.  You will see gentle bubbling on the electrodes after pushing the electroporator footswitch, (the bubbling is an indication that the system is working properly).# Recipes1.  Ringer’s solutiona.

Set up the surgical area. a.  Place the isoflurane chamber near the microscope and place the anesthesia platform with the nose cone under the microscope objective. Place a mouse heating pad by the nose cone. b.  Place the Proparacaine, Algerbrush, weck-cels, and trephine on the lab bench near the surgical area. Have 20~ul of 1:40 diluted Fluorescein solution drawn up in a pipette (see Recipes). c.  Clean off the Algerbrush burr by rubbing with an alcohol swab.2.  Anesthetize the mouse in the isoflurane chamber. A typical approach for anesthesia involves placing the animal in an induction chamber connected to an oxygen source and isoflurane vaporizer, and adjusting oxygen flow to 0.9 liters/min and the isoflurane vaporizer to 1-2% . As soon as the mouse becomes unresponsive and has shallow breathing, it may be transferred to the anesthesia platform with the nose cone and placed on a heating pad. Position the mouse head so that the eye to be injured is facing up towards the microscope objective.3.  Squeeze the bottle of Proparacaine and place 1 drop of Proparacaine on the cornea. Wait 30 sec.4.  Use a weck-cel to dry off the cornea by gently sweeping across cornea once and dabbing both corners of the eye.5.  Apply periocular pressure with one hand to proptose the mouse eye. (Optional step: Take a brightfield picture of the cornea prior to injury.)6.  Use the other hand to mark the cornea with the trephine as central as possible with gentle pressure. Hold the handle of trephine with your thumb and second fingers and place the entire circular edge on the cornea. Gently turn the trephine with mild pressure approximately 3 clock hours to mark the cornea. Avoid making multiple marks.7.  Turn the Algerbrush on and make an epithelial defect in the center of the cornea by applying gentle pressure in a circular manner and observing a break in the surface epithelial cell layer. Carefully extend the epithelial defect close to the trephine mark.8.  Turn the Algerbrush off and use the dull blades of the Algerbrush burr to gently remove the remaining corneal epithelium out to the trephine mark. Apply Fluorescein solution to the cornea and confirm size of epithelial defect using the microscope GFP filter.9.  Optional step: Apply periocular pressure to proptose the mouse eye. Take a fluorescence picture of the wounded cornea after applying Fluorescein solution and using the GFP filter (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Corneal scratch/epithelial injury.

Use a weck-cel to dry off the cornea by gently sweeping across cornea once and dabbing both corners of the eye.5.  Use the forceps to submerge the filter paper into the NaOH solution for exactly 10 sec.6.  Apply periocular pressure with one hand to proptose the mouse eye. (Optional step: Take a brightfield picture of the cornea prior to injury.)7.  Use forceps in the other hand to apply the NaOH-soaked filter paper to the center cornea for exactly 30 sec. Perform this step using the stereomicroscope to precisely place the filter paper as central as possible.8.  Remove the filter disc from the cornea using forceps.9.  Immediately flush the eye with 500~ul PBS to wash away residual NaOH (apply PBS, dry with weck-cel, apply PBS, dry with weck-cel, repeat until all 500~ul PBS has been used).10. Optional step: Apply periocular pressure to proptose the mouse eye. Take a fluorescence picture of the wounded cornea after applying Fluorescein solution and using the GFP filter.()Figure 3.

Synchronize worms with bleaching protocols: use C. elegans plates with many gravid hermaphrodites (Stiernagle, 2006). Wash the plates with sterile H_2O . 2.  Collect the liquid in a sterile 15ml Falcon tube. Add H_2O to a total volume of 3.5ml .3.  Mix 0.5 ml 5 N NaOH with 1 ml bleach. Make this solution fresh just before use Add to the centrifuge tube with the worms.4.  Vortex the tube for a few seconds. Repeat vortexing every 2 min for a total of 10min .5.  Spin the tube in a centrifuge for 30 sec at 1,300xg to pellet the released eggs.6.  Aspirate to 0.1 ml .7.  Add sterile H_2O to 5ml . Vortex for a few seconds.8.  Repeat steps A6 and A7.9.  Transfer the eggs in the remaining 0.1ml of liquid to the edge of a clean NGM plate seeded with an E. coli OP50 lawn and incubate at ^20^°C . Note: If you use C. elegans mutants that do not change their intrinsic nature under high temperature, you can incubate eggs at 25~^°C as some mutants grow slower than WT.10. Inoculate Bcc strains in 15~ml Falcon tubes containing 3 ml of LB and incubate the tubes at 37^°C for 24h in shaking condition (220 rpm). Note: As controls, use E. coli OP50 in the place of Bcc strains.# B.  Day 21.  Normalize Bcc cultures at 1.7O D/ml and seed 50~ul of the culture on 3.5 cm diameter plates containing 3ml of NGM agar (slow killing assay, SKA) or PGS agar (fast killing assay, FKA). Incubate the plates O/N at 37^°C . Note: Incubation of Bcc strains at 37~^°C should never exceed 16 h. Do not store Bcc seeded plates at 4^°C_: , as many of these pathogens are very sensitive to temperature and this can cause variation.2.  Check the developmental stage of worms. After 24h worms should be at larval stage L2 or L3 when grown at ^20^°C .# C.  Day 31.  Wash synchronized worms at larval stage 4 (L4) off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15 ml Corning tubes.2.  Wash worms 2-3 times with M9 buffer to remove residual bacterial cells.3.  Spot 30-40 L4 worms on the plates seeded with Bcc strains (5 replicas). Note: Before adding the worms, plates should be kept at room temperature to cool them down after the incubation at 37^°C .4.  Count worms at time 0. Incubate the plates at ^20^°C and perform daily count of surviving worms up to day 5 (for FKA) and day 6 (for SKA). Note: A worm is considered dead when it no longer responds to gentle touch with a platinum wire.5.  At the end of the experiment, calculate the average percentage of surviving worms.6.  Evaluate Bcc pathogenicity. The virulence ranking (VR) ranges from 0 to 3 and it is based on the percentage of surviving worms after the period of observation. A Bcc strain is considered to be non-pathogenic (VR=0) ) when the percentage of worms alive at the conclusion of the period of observation ranges from 100% to 80% ; VR=1 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 79% to 50% ; VR=2 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 49% to 6% ; finally, the VR is considered 3 when the percentage of surviving worms was eq5% (Figure 1).()Figure 1.

Preprocessing of SNP array data1.  Normalize .CEL files by the appropriate software depending on the array platform.2.  Export  the  normalized  data:  chromosome,  position,  Log_R_Ratio  (Illumina)  or Log_2_Ratio (Affymetrix), B allele frequency (BAF, Illumina) or Allelic Difference (AD, Affymetrix) into a text file.3.  Process SNP-arrays by (for example) GAP method (Popova et al., 2009) to obtain (Birkbak et al., 2011) estimation of normal contamination and (Carter et al., 2012) absolute copy number and allelic content profiles (Table 1).Table 1. Segmented tumor genomic profile (a fragment from Affymetrix OncoScan 300K)()* 1 stands for p arm and 1.5 stands for q arm of chromosome 1; pericentric region is indicated in red.# B.  Quality control1.  Quality control of measured SNP-array profile: software for primary data normalization usually provides quality index for each chip; chips indicated to have marginal quality have to be excluded from further analysis; indication of quality cut-offs could be found in corresponding User Guides.2.  Contamination of tumor sample by normal stromal cells: sample with more than 65% of predicted normal cells admixture have to be excluded from further analysis (Note: Measured tumor sample usually represents a mixture of tumor and normal cells in different proportions, which results in different contrast in the measured SNP-array profile; 60-70% of normal contamination is at the limit of current recognition techniques).3.  Quality control of copy number and allelic content recognition: Pattern of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a tumor genome have to be “interpretable”, meaning, copy number variation and allelic imbalance profiles have to be consistent. Unfortunately, there is no reliable measure of such consistency developed; we used manual control of recognition based on the GAP plots (Figure 1). GAP plot of a tumor genome is a two dimensional representation of segmented SNP array profiles, where each circle represents a segment (Popova et al., 2009). Clear and regular structure of the GAP plot indicates consistency (Figure 1A), while chaotic structure indicates inconsistency (Figure 1B). Samples with inconsistent profiles have to be excluded from further analysis.()Figure 1. GAP plots for two tumor samples measured by Affymetrix OncoScan 300K representing (A) high quality and (B) low quality profiles. GAP plot of a tumor genome is a two dimensional representation of segmented SNP array profiles, where each circle represents a segment (Popova et al., 2009). Tumor samples are from GEO database (GSE28330, Birkbak et al., 2012).4.  Quality control of adequate detection of chromosomal breaks: Highly contaminated tumor samples together with unspecific variation in SNP array profiles often result in false positive chromosomal breaks detected by segmentation algorithms; the sample need to be discarded in the case of large number of false positive breaks. Adequate formal procedure for this type of quality control is not yet developed. We performed rough visual estimation of consistency of detected breaks in copy number variation and in recognized copy number profiles.Note: Poor quality sample comprises around 10-15% of hybridized samples, including low tumor content, poor hybridization, low recognition quality, etc.C.  Calculating the number of large-scale chromosomal breaks from segmented profile (Table 1, Figure 2):Note: Here we describe how to estimate the number of chromosomal breaks related to homologous recombination deficiency; filtering of variation is performed only for the purpose of estimation of breakpoints number and has no relation to particular alterations whatever important they are.1.  Filtering out micro-variation: The size of micro-variation S_micro is the lower limit of the detectable somatic alteration size, which is dependent on the SNP density in the array; for example, we used 50 SNPs for Affymetrix SNP 6.0; 30 SNPs for Illumina 600K; etc. Note: Main reason for this filtering is that micro-variations are often linked to germline copy number variations. a.  Exclude from the segmented genomic profile all segments less than S_micro SNPs and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.2.  Filtering out and smoothing small-scale variation: The size of small-scale variation, S_small <3 Mb, was defined in (Popova et al., 2012).Note: Main reason for this definition is that starting from 3 Mb chromosomal breaks follow a Poisson distribution, i.e. are independent from each other; while the small-scale segments tend to cluster in discrete chromosomal regions.a.  Order small-scale segments according to the size.b.  Exclude from the segmented genomic profile the smallest segment and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.c.  Repeat filtering and smoothing until the last small segment. Note: The way of filtering and smoothing small-scale variations has a minor effect on the resulting profile.3.  Calculating number of Large-scale State Transitions (LSTs) of the size S Mb: LST_SMb is defined as a chromosomal break (change in copy number or allelic content) between two adjacent (<3 Mb in between) segments >=S Mb each; number of LSTs is calculated directly from the segmented genomic profile after filtering and smoothing of small-scale variation (Figure 2).a.  Annotate  chromosomal  breaks  as  follows:  If  two  segments  from  the  same chromosome arm differ in Copy Number or in Major Allele, and are >=S M b in size, and the distance between the segments is <3 Mb, the break is annotated as LST_SMb;b.  Calculate number of LST_SMb ( Xi=3 , 4,…, 11 Mb) in a tumor genome. Note: Centromeric breaks are not taken into account.()Figure 2. Example of genomic profile of one chromosome with detected copy numbers and LSTs. LRR: log R ratio profile; BAF: B allele frequency profile; GT: segmental genotypes recognized by GAP; LST_10 Mb: black arrows point to LST_10 Mb detected. The black under-line shows large-scale segments obtained after filtering and smoothing small-scale variations seen in the GT profile. Chromosome 3 of a tumor sample from GEO database is shown (GSE28330, Birkbak et al., 2012).# D. Estimation of tumor ploidy:1.  Estimate DNA index for a tumor genome as an average copy number in a genome divided by 2.2.  Estimate chromosome counts in a tumor genome as a sum of copy numbers at pericentric regions of each chromosome arm (Table 1), following the rules: a.  If the size of a segment in pericentric region is >=1.5 Mb (or 500 SNPs for Affymetrix SNP6.0), the number of copies of corresponding chromosome arm is set to that of the segment; b.  If the size of a segment in pericentric region is <1.5 Mb, chromosome arm count is replaced by its average copy number. Note: Chromosome number is estimated after filtering micro-variation.3.  Estimate tumor ploidy following the rule: tumor ploidy is estimated to be 2 (near-diploid genome) if DNA index <1.3 and chromosome counts <60 ; tumor ploidy is estimated to be 4 (near-tetraploid genome) if DNA index >=1.3 and chromosome counts >=60 . Note: This attribution is obtained for breast and ovarian cancer genomes based on the analysis of a large number of tumor genomes, (Popova et al., 2012). Genomes with ambiguous attribution of ploidy represented less than 5% of all cases considered. Other cancers might have different genomic evolution and the thresholds for ploidy attribution might need to be adjusted.# E. Signature of homologous recombination deficiency in a tumor genomeBased on the analysis of a large series of breast cancers with known status of BRCA1/2 genes the number of LST_6,7,8,9,10 Mb were found to represent effective discriminating features with naturally defined ploidy-specific cutoffs, which allowed prediction of BRCA1/2 inactivation with high accuracy and precision (Table 2). Testing the signature on ovarian cancer showed LST_6,7 Mb to be the most efficient prediction features with similar to breast cancer cohort cut-offs.1.  Tumor genome is annotated as homologous recombination deficient if number of LSTs in a tumor genome is higher than corresponding ploidy-specific cut-off (Table 2). Note: Tumors with borderline LST number could be false positives due to false positive breaks detected in the genome. Inconsistency among LST_6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Mb predictions are rare.Table 2. Cut-offs for LST number predicting BRCAness in breast cancer()*Cut-offs  correspond  to  max (TPR-FPR);  cut-offs  in  parenthesis  correspond  to  100 sensitivity.P: Numbers of BRCA1/2 mutated tumors; N: Number of BRCA1/2 wild type or not tested tumors;TPR: True positive rate; FPR: False positive rate.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preprocessing of SNP Array Data\nNormalize.CEL files by the appropriate software depending on the array platform.\nExport the normalized data: chromosome, position, Log_R_Ratio (Illumina) or Log_2_Ratio (Affymetrix), B allele frequency (BAF, Illumina) or Allelic Difference (AD, Affymetrix) into a text file.\n## Process SNP-Arrays\nProcess SNP-arrays by (for example) GAP method to obtain estimation of normal contamination and absolute copy number and allelic content profiles.\nRefer to Table 1 for an example of a segmented tumor genomic profile.\n## Quality Control\nPerform quality control of measured SNP-array profile: check the quality index for each chip and exclude chips with marginal quality.\n## Contamination of Tumor Sample by Normal Stromal Cells\nCheck for contamination of tumor sample by normal stromal cells: exclude samples with more than 65% of predicted normal cells admixture.\nNote that measured tumor sample usually represents a mixture of tumor and normal cells in different proportions.\n## Quality Control of Copy Number and Allelic Content Recognition\nCheck the pattern of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a tumor genome: it should be interpretable.\nUse manual control of recognition based on the GAP plots to ensure consistency.\nRefer to Figure 1 for examples of GAP plots.\n## Quality Control of Adequate Detection of Chromosomal Breaks\nPerform rough visual estimation of consistency of detected breaks in copy number variation and in recognized copy number profiles.\nDiscard samples with a large number of false positive breaks.\n## Calculating the Number of Large-Scale Chromosomal Breaks\n## Filtering Out Micro-Variation\nDetermine the size of micro-variation (S_micro) based on the SNP density in the array.\nExclude from the segmented genomic profile all segments less than S_micro SNPs and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.\n## Filtering Out and Smoothing Small-Scale Variation\nDefine the size of small-scale variation (S_small) as <3 Mb.\nOrder small-scale segments according to the size and exclude the smallest segment, linking adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.\nRepeat filtering and smoothing until the last small segment.\n## Calculating Number of Large-Scale State Transitions (LSTs)\nAnnotate chromosomal breaks as LST_SMb if two segments from the same chromosome arm differ in Copy Number or in Major Allele, and are >=S Mb in size, and the distance between the segments is <3 Mb.\nCalculate the number of LST_SMb (Xi=3, 4, …, 11 Mb) in a tumor genome.\nRefer to Figure 2 for an example of a genomic profile with detected copy numbers and LSTs.\n## Estimation of Tumor Ploidy\nEstimate DNA index for a tumor genome as an average copy number in a genome divided by 2.\n## Estimate Chromosome Counts\nEstimate chromosome counts in a tumor genome as a sum of copy numbers at pericentric regions of each chromosome arm.\nFollow the rules for estimating chromosome arm count based on segment size in pericentric region.\n## Estimate Tumor Ploidy\nEstimate tumor ploidy based on DNA index and chromosome counts.\nUse the rule: tumor ploidy is estimated to be 2 (near-diploid genome) if DNA index <1.3 and chromosome counts <60; tumor ploidy is estimated to be 4 (near-tetraploid genome) if DNA index >=1.3 and chromosome counts >=60.\n## Signature of Homologous Recombination Deficiency\nAnnotate tumor genome as homologous recombination deficient if the number of LSTs is higher than the corresponding ploidy-specific cut-off.\nRefer to Table 2 for cut-offs for LST number predicting BRCAness in breast cancer.\nNote that tumors with borderline LST number could be false positives due to false positive breaks detected in the genome.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-2203","Bio-protocol-2366","Bio-protocol-2716","Bio-protocol-2574","Protocol.io-5515","Bio-protocol-788","Protocol.io-707","Protocol.io-85","Bio-protocol-2079","Bio-protocol-1990"]}

(1997) and Pouilly et al. (2008); as used in Sarilar et al. (2013). A.  Targeting TE insertion sites1.  Restriction of genomic DNAs a.  Make a restriction reaction mixture that will be distributed equally into individual Eppendorf tubes. The reaction mixture combines (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 36~ul per reaction), the 1x enzyme buffer and the selected endonuclease (6 U per reaction), taking into account that 5ul of genomic DNA will be added into the mix. b.  Distribute 31~ul of the reaction mixture into each Eppendorf tube. c.  Add 5~ul of each DNA solution to be analysed (which correspond to 500 ng of genomic DNA) to the corresponding tube. d.  Mix gently the solution in each tube by pipeting, and centrifuge shortly. e.  Incubate at least 3h at 37^°C . f. Stop the enzyme activity by incubating the tubes 20 min at 65^°C . g.  Put the tubes on ice, centrifuge briefly and replace them on ice. Proceed immediately to the ligation step.2.  Prepare the adapters and ligate them to the restricted DNAsa.  In a 0.5ml Eppendorf tube, mix the two oligonucleotides ( 100~uM each) in equal proportions to make the adapter solution (final concentration of 50uM) ).b.  Incubate the mix at 95~^°C for 5 min (in a thermocycler) and let cool it down on the bench at room temperature.c.  Make a ligation reaction mixture, by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 50~ul per reaction), 1x ligase buffer, adapter solution (50 pmol) and T4 DNA ligase (1 U per reaction).d.  Distribute 14ul of the reaction mixture into the Eppendorf tubes containing each 36ul of restricted DNAs.e.  Mix gently using a pipette and then centrifuge shortly.f.     Incubate at 20-25^°C overnight (on the bench) to allow ligation.g.  Dilute the ligation products to 1/10 in 96-well PCR plates: 90~ul of sterile ultrapure water + 10 ul of the restriction-ligation products. Note: Store non-diluted restriction-ligation products at -20~^°C_i , but keep 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products at 4~^°C to avoid DNA degradation because of freezing - thawing cycles.Pre-amplificationa.  Use the first primer pair P1/P2 (Figure 1b) for the pre-amplification.b.  Make a pre-amplification PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20ul per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5 m M) ), dNTP solution (200~uM) , primer P1 anchored in the adapter (8 pmol), primer P2 anchored in the TE under study (8 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (3-4 U).c.  Distribute 17~ul of the pre-amplification reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.d.  Add 3ul of the 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.e.  Centrifuge.f.      PCR program i.    1 cycle at 72^°C for 2 min ii.    1 cycle at 94~^°C for 3 min iii.   25 cycles of ( 94~^°C for 30 sec, 56~^°C for 30 sec and 72^°C for 1 min) iv.   1 cycle at 72^°C for 5 min v.     Keep at 10^°Cg.  Verification of the pre-amplification products can be performed by agarose gel electrophoresis: Load 4~ul of the reaction product (with loading buffer) and run the electrophoresis for 20min at 100or .Note: A smear should be obtained (an example of the gel is shown in Figure 1b). h. Dilute the pre-amplification product in 96-well PCR plates according to the plate layout to carry out the separation of fragments using the LI-COR DNA analyzer. Note: The factor of dilution is usually 1/10 (36 µl of sterile ultrapure water ^ Ḋ +4 Ḍ µl of pre-amplification product) but it has to be adapted (1/2, 1/5, 1/10, or no dilution) according to the intensity of the smear observed after electrophoresis, in order to get homogeneous selective amplification products.4.  Selective amplificationa.  Use the second primer pair P3/P4 (Figure 1c) for the selective amplification to perform a nested PCR (to increase the specificity of the PCR reaction).b.  Make a selective PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20~ul per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5m M) ), dNTP solution (200~uM) , selective primer P3 anchored in the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides (4 pmol), selective primer P4 anchored in the TE under study and labelled with IRDye (4 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (1.5-2 U). Note: The primer labelled with the IRDye is sensitive to the light; the PCR plate has to be covered with aluminium foil to avoid degradation.c.  Distribute 15ul of the selective PCR reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.d.  Add 5~ul of the diluted pre-amplification products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.e.  Centrifuge.f. PCR program: a typical touchdown program is performed (Vos et al., 1995) to increase the specificity of the PCR amplification. i.   1 cycle at 94^°C for 4 min ii.   13 cycles of 94^°C for 30 sec, 65^°C (then -0.7~^°C per cycle) for 30 sec and 72^°C for 1 min iii.  25 cycles of 94^°C for 30 sec, 56^°C for 30 sec and 72^°C for 1 min) iv.  1 cycle at 72^°C for 5 min v.    Keep at 10^°C Note: Maintain the 96-well PCR plates out of the light by covering them with aluminium foil and once the program is finished keep them at -20~^°C. .B.  Electrophoresis run on LI-COR DNA analyzer to separate amplified products1.  Prepare the DNA analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.2.  Use 0.25 mm spacers between glass plates and prepare 40mI of 5.5% acrylamide gel.3.  Do pre-run with autofocus and following parameters: 45^°C ; 2,000 W; 25m A .()Figure 1. Schematic description of the different steps of the SSAP procedure to detect TE insertion site polymorphisms. (a). The genomic DNAs to be analysed are restricted using an endonuclease (here EcoRI, as used in Sarilar et al., 2013) and then ligated to corresponding adapters. (b). A pre-amplification is performed on the restrictionligation products using a specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P1) complementary to the adapter and the other primer (P2) anchored in the TE of interest. As illustrated by the picture, the pre-amplification should lead to a PCR product visualized as a smear after agarose gel electrophoresis. (c). The resulting PCR products are then subjected to a selective PCR amplification using another specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P3) complementary to the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides and the other primer (P4) anchored in the TE and labeled with an IRDye (at the varsigma^, end). (d). The resulting amplicons are finally resolved in a denaturing acrylamide gel; polymorphic bands can be visualized and scored as non-additive SSAP bands (being additional ^+ or missing -) when comparing the progeny profiling with the parental ones (as illustrated here for the analysis of resynthesized allotetraploid lines in comparison with their  diploid  progenitors,  Sarilar  et  al.,  2013).  Identification  of  the  nature  of  the polymorphism responsible for non-additivity (e.g. transposition, genomic rearrangement, polymorphism at the endonuclease cutting site) requires further cloning and sequencing of the corresponding SSAP amplicon.4.  Load the gela.  Mix the PCR products of selective amplification (2~ul) with equal amount of loading buffer.b.  Heat the samples at 95~^°C for 5 min for DNA denaturation and snap cool on ice before loading. Keep also on ice while loading the samples on the acrylamide gel.c.  Load 0.5~ul of each sample in each well. Between each deposit, rinse the multisyringe in water. Load on the same acrylamide gel the samples which have to be compared, and load the controls on each gel if necessary.5.  Analyze the SSAP multiband fingerprints by scoring polymorphic bands which may correspond to TE insertion site polymorphisms (Figure 1d).

Collect stably transformed free-living adult Strongyloides from charcoal cultures of fresh host feces incubated at ^22 ^°C for 48h (Lok, 2007).  Extract genomic DNA (gDNA) from 500 freeliving adult worms using the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit. Parasites do not need to be homogenized.  Isolated worms are pelleted at 14,000×g and then substituted for the “ground tissue” in step 2, followed by step 2b of the manufacturer’s protocol accompanying the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit, using reagent volumes recommended for tissue samples of 5-10~mg~ . Resuspend extracted gDNA in 50~ul TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, p H8.0AA ) to yield ~ 25n g/ul .2.  Digest Genomic DNA (100n g) with BstYI, BamHI, and Bgl II for ^2h in a total volume of 15~ul for each reaction (Figure 1A). Follow manufacturer’s instructions for reaction conditions and inactivation steps for each restriction enzyme.3.  Add 5~ul of 100  uM SPLINK-BOT  oligonucleotide, 5~uI00~uM SPLINK-GATC-TOP oligonucleotide and 10× NEB Buffer 2 in a total reaction volume of 100ul . Heat to 95~^°C for 3 min then cool on bench to room temperature to anneal splinkerette oligonucleotides. Ligate digested gDNA with GATC sticky ends to annealed splinkerette oligonucleotides using T4 ligase for ^8h at 16~^°C in a total volume of 30ul (Figure 1B).4.  Two rounds of spPCR are conducted following ligation of genomic DNA restriction fragments to splinkerette oligo nucleotides.a.  For the first round of spPCR, combine primer SPLINK#1, which targets the ligated splinkerette oligonucleotides, with either primer 3’SPLNK-PB#1 or primer 5’SPLNK-PB#1. 3’SPLNK-PB#1 and 5’SPLNK-PB#1 target the 3^ and 5' ends of the transgene sequences, respectively.  Carry  out  the  amplification  with  Phusion  Polymerase  and  5-20  ng  of splinkerette-ligated genomic DNA as template. Thermal cycling conditions are: i. 98~^°C for 1 min ii. 98~^°C for 20 sec iii. 55^°C for 15 sec iv. 72^°C for 2 min v. 29 more cycles from ii to iv vi. A final extension at 72~^°C for 10m i n .b.  The second round of spPCR is nested PCR carried out with primer SPLNK#2 paired with either primer 3’SPLNK-PB#2 or primer 5’SPLNK-PB#2 and a 1:20 dilution of spPCR products from the first-round spPCR as template. Carry out the second-round amplification with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase using the same thermal cycling conditions as specified  for  first-round  spPCR.  Analyze  all  PCR  products  by 1% agarose  gel electrophoresis.c.  Incubate the products of second-round spPCR with 1 µl Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (1 U/ml) and 1 µl Exonuclease I (20,000cup/ml) at 37~^°C for ^2h , and then at 80~^°C for 15~m i n (Figure 1C).d.

Workflow of library construction for genome-wide bisulfite sequencingA.  DNA fragmentation by ultrasonic destruction1.  Dissolve 2~u of high quality, high molecular weight genomic DNA extracted from Arabidopsis leaf tissues in 130~ul TE buffer and transfer to a 6×16~mm glass microtube with AFA fiber with pre-slit snap-caps. Genomic DNA extracted using the commonly used CTAB (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) method is suitable as long as the genomic DNA runs at a high molecular weight (>2~kb) and as a clean single band in 0.8% agarose gel. The quality of genomic DNA can also be monitored with the 2100 BioAnalyzer (Figure 2A).()Figure 2. BioAnalyzer traces of an Arabidopsis DNA sample (OE) that was processed through the workflow of the procedure described in this protocol.A. Genomic DNA; B. Ultrasonically fragmented DNA; C. Ultrasonically fragmented and magnetic bead cleaned up DNA; D. Adaptor-ligated DNA fragments recovered by the agarose gel-based selection; E. The final sequencing library (post PCR amplification).2.  Shear the genomic DNA into fragments with an average size of 300 bp in the S2 adaptive focus acoustic disruptor using the following settings (for fragmenting DNA with the majority of fragments in the 150-450 bp range) (Figure 2B): Duty cycle 10% Intensity 4 Cycles/burst 200 Time 132 sec Temperature 6^°C The S2 instrument is connected to the refrigerated water bath circulator that is set at 6~^°C in order to maintain a constant temperature during the sonication process.3.  Transfer to a 1.5~m~l~ microcentrifuge tube, and estimate the recovered volume with a pipettor. Typically, 125ul of the DNA solution is recovered.4.  Add a suspension (slur) of AMPure magnetic beads at a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.73:1 (v/v). This bead-to-sample ratio is used to collect DNA fragments over 200 bp prior to construction of the sequencing library.5.  Incubate the mix at room temperature for 15 min with shaking at 700 rpm in the Thermomixer R to allow DNA to bind with the beads.6.  Pulse spin to collect the mix at the bottom of the tube, and then put the tube on the magnetic stand for 1-2 min until the solution is completely clear. The magnetic beads will be attracted to the magnet, thus allowing removal of the supernatant. Remove and discard the supernatant.7.  Leave the tube on the magnetic stand and wash the beads twice as follows: for each wash add 1 ml of freshly prepared 70% ethanol, gently pipet the beads up and down six times, let the beads sit for 30-60 sec, and then discard the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the beads.8.  Following the second wash, pulse spin the tube to collect traces of ethanol, and then place the tube on the magnetic stand. Remove ethanol traces with a fine-tipped pipettor.9.  Air dry the magnetic beads for 1 to 3 min at room temperature.10. Elute DNA as follows: remove the tube from the magnetic stand and place on a plastic rack, add 30~ul of elution buffer, vortex vigorously for 10 sec, place the tube back on the magnetic stand until the solution becomes completely clear, and then use a pipettor to transfer the supernatant containing the DNA into a clean microcentrifuge tube. Repeat the elution by adding another 30~ul of elution buffer as above. Pool the two eluate fractions.11. Save 3 ul of the DNA sample for quantification in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer according to the product instructions (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/Q32854)and for fragment size confirmation with the 2100 BioAnalyzer (Figure 2C). The desired size range of the fragments should be 200-450 bp.At this point the DNA can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# B.  Library constructionSequencing libraries are made using the low-throughput TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (TruSeq DNA sample preparation guide) with a few modifications (see below). The adaptors included in this kit are methylated and are therefore compatible with bisulfite sequencing for DNA methylation analysis.1.  End repair the DNA fragments in the following reaction: 50ul above DNA sample (1.5u) 10ul end-repair reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 40ul end-repair mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 30~^°C for 30 min. Clean up the reaction mix with AMPure magnetic beads as described above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10), except that the bead-tosample ratio is 1:1 (v/v).  Elute DNA in 17.5ul elution buffer. This bead-to-sample ratio is used to collect essentially all DNA fragments.2. z -adenylate the end-repaired DNA fragments in the following reaction: 15ul end-repaired DNA 2.5ul3\" -adenylation reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 12.5ul A-tailing mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 37^°C for 30 m i n . The adenylation mix is compatible with the ligation reaction; therefore, no clean-up is necessary at this step.3.  Ligate methylated adaptors to the 3^ -adenylated DNA fragments in the following reaction: 30ul adenylated DNA (the entire adenylation reaction from step B2) 2.5ul ligation reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 2.5ul ligation mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) 2.5ul adaptors (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 30~^°C for 10m i n . Add 5~ul of ligation stop buffer. Clean-up sample using AMPure magnetic beads as described above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10). with a 1:1 (v/v) bead-to-sample ratio. Elute adaptor-ligated DNA in 22.5ul elution buffer.4.  Size-select adaptor-ligated DNA fragments (250-500 bp) in a 2% TAE agarose gel as follows. Prepare 100ml of the solution in a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask, heat in a microwave oven until agarose is fully dissolved, add SYBR Safe stain (1:10,000 v/v dye-to-gel ratio) to the molten agarose solution and swirl to mix, and then pour the gel-dye solution into properly set-up casting of the gel electrophoresis apparatus. A 10-well comb is placed at one end of the gel casting tray to form wells. Allow gel to fully solidify (30 m i n) . Load a50 bp ladder in one of the gel wells to aid in size estimation. Mix the sample with a suitable sample loading dye and load into any of the additional wells. Connect electrodes to power supply and electrophorese at 100or until the quickest moving dye reaches _3/4 of the gel length from the wells.  No post electrophoresis staining is necessary when the dye is added as suggested here. SYBR Safe is used instead of ethidium bromide in order to avoid UV damage (during viewing) of DNA fragments. View the gel on a Safe Imager 2.0 blue light transilluminator. Cut the gel region containing fragments in the 250-500 bp range using a sterile, disposable scalpel (Figure 3). Transfer the gel slice into a DNA LoBind _2.0 m centrifuge tube. If gel slices are too large, they can be placed in a 15~ml conical tube. After the agarose gel is dissolved (see step 5 below), split dissolved volume if necessary into DNA LoBind 2.0ml tubes for DNA extraction.()Figure 3. Size selection of adaptor-ligated DNA fragments in an agarose gel. Two Arabidopsis genomic DNA samples (A and B) were fragmented in the S2 adaptive focus acoustic disruptor, end-repaired, 3. -adenylated, adaptor-ligated, and separated in a 2% TAE agarose gel. Gel wells were formed using a 10-well-forming comb (8 mm wide wells). Ten ul of ready-to-load 50 bp ladder were loaded in the flanking positions of the samples in the gel for excision process. Left: before excision; Right: post excision.5.  Extract  DNA  from  the  gel  using  the  QIAquick  gel  extraction  kit  following  the manufacturer's instructions (http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sampletechnologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-gel-extractionkit#resources). Elute DNA with 22 µl elution buffer (included in the QIAquick gel extraction kit).6.  Set aside 2ul to quantitate the library in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with a Qubit dsDNA HSassay kit according to the product instructions (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/Q32854). The final library  yield using  this  protocol  is  usually  300-400  ng  (Figure  2D),  which  corresponds  to  a concentration of 13-18 DNA ng/ µl.At this point the DNA library can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# C. Bisulfite treatmentThe entire library (300-400 ng) is subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EpiTectbisulfite kit following the manufacturer's instructions(http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/assay-technologies/epigenetics/epitect-bisulfite-kits- resources). Briefly:1.  Prepare buffer BW, buffer BD, carrier RNA, buffer BL, and bisulfite mix following the instructions in the kit.2.  Treat DNA with bisulfite in the following reaction: 20ul DNA (the entire library) 85ul bisulfite mix (included in the EpiTect kit) 35ul DNA protect buffer (included in the EpiTect kit) Incubate at the following conditions in a thermal cycler: 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 25m i n , 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 85~m i n , 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 175min , and finally hold at ^20^°C .3.  Purify the bisulfite-converted DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute DNA twice, each time with 20~ul elution buffer (included in the EpiTect kit) and pool the two eluate fractions.4.  Further  purify  and  concentrate  the  DNA  using  a  MinElute  column  following  the instructions in the MinElute PCR purification kit (http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sampletechnologies/dna-cleanup/minelute-pcr-purification-kit#resources). Elute DNA in 15~ul elution buffer (included in the MinElute PCR purification kit). At this point the bisulfite-converted library can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# D.  Library enrichment1.  Amplify 1 ng of the bisulfite-converted library using a uracil-insensitive PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase and the primer cocktail included in the Illumina TruSeq library construction kit in the following reaction: 17.25ul double-distilled water 15 µl DNA template 1 ng, usually the entire eluate of the above library) 5 µl Pfu Turbo Buffer (coming with the Pfu Turbo polymerase) 2.5 µl DMSO1.25 µl dNTPs (10 mM) 5ul primer cocktail (included in the TruSeq Kit)1ul Pfu Turbo Cx Hotstart polymeraseThe amplification conditions are: denaturation at 98^°C for 30 sec, 14-18 cycles 98~^°C for 15 sec, 60~^°C for 30 sec, and 72~^°C for 1 m i n ), and final extension at 72~^°C for 5m i n . Depending on the yield of the bisulfite treatment step, the number of PCR amplification cycles should be as small as possible. This step is to selectively enrich DNA library fragments that have methylated adaptors at both ends, and to generate sufficient DNA for accurate quantitation.2.  Clean the PCR amplification products twice using AMPure magnetic beads as describe above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10) with a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.85:1 (v/v). Elute DNA in 30~ul of elution buffer.  This bead-to-sample ratio is used to remove dNTPs and primers while retaining all the DNA amplification fragments above 150 bp.3.  Use 1~ul of the DNA sample for fragment size confirmation with the 2100 BioAnalyzer. The average insert size of the library generated by this protocol is 360 bp (Figure 2E). A different average size can be obtained by adjusting the DNA ultrasonic fragmentation conditions (DNA fragmentation section: step A2) and by choosing the desired range at the size selection step (Library construction section: step B4).4.  Use 1 µl of the DNA sample for quantification in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and 1~ul for quantification by qPCR with the KAPA library quantification kit on the ABI7900HT realtime PCR system. This amplification protocol results in 50-200 ng of library in 26ul . The library is now ready for sequencing. If necessary, the library concentration is adjusted to 10 nM by diluting with Elution buffer (see recipes) and submitted for sequencing.# Recipes1. Elution buffer 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)2.

Protect  microorganism  preservation  System  (Technical  Service  Consultants)  for preservation of E. . coli cells at -80~^°C Note: When required, a single inoculated bead was removed from the vial and dropped into a LB broth containing the appropriate antibiotic.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nNote: Centrifugation steps were performed at _4° C unless otherwise noted.Afp purification protocol1.  A single inoculating bead (Protect Microorganism Preservation System) from the -80~^°C stock of an appropriate Afp or its derivatives bearing E . coli strain is used to inoculate 3 ml of LB with the respective antibiotics.2.  The culture is incubated overnight at 37~^°C with agitation at 250 rpm (overnight culture).3.  1 ml of the overnight culture is used to inoculate 50m of fresh LB with appropriate antibiotic/s.4.  The 50ml of the cell culture is grown at 37~^°C with agitation to an OD600 of 1.0. Note: O D_600 measurements are taken from the cell cultures diluted with the LB media at ratios of 1:10. A cuvette with LB medium is used as a blank.5.  The cells are transferred into sterile falcon tubes (50~m) and harvested by centrifugation at 2,268× g for 10 min at room temperature.6.  The cell pellets are resuspended in fresh 50ml0.4× LB broth with respective antibiotic/s. Note: Initially 1 ml of the 0.4x~~L B broth is added to each pellet and the pellet is resuspended by vigorous taping on the tube. Then the tube is filled up to 5Om I with 0.4x LB broth and the content of the tube is transferred to the same 50 ml flask as the culture was grown. Antibiotics are added directly to the flask.7. 500~ul of steril filtered 20% arabinose (final concentration 0.2% ) is added to each 50~ml culture to induce the protein expression. Note: After arabinose is added, avoid shaking the cultures.8.  The cultures are incubated for a further ^24h at ^22^°C at 40 rpm.9.  The induced cells are harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,268× g . Note: Higher centrifugation speed (4,629× g for 10 min) may be nessessary if pellet is too loose.10. The pellet from each 50m l culture is re-suspended at 4~^°C in 0.8m pre-chilled TM buffer.11. The  resultant  approximately 0.9 ~ml re-suspensions  are  transferred  into 1.7~~~m~l~~ microcentrifuge tubes and subjected to three 20-sec rounds of sonication using a Sanyo Soniprep 150 Sonicator (18~Omega) . At least 1 min of incubation on ice is included between sonication steps.12. One μl (10 units) of the DNase is added and the sample is left at room temperature for 10 min.13. Following the DNase incubation step the suspension is centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4^°C .14. The pellets are discarded and clear supernatants containing soluble recombinant protein are filtered through 0.45-µm-pore-size filters. Notes:a.  If the samples need to be stored for 1-2 days, 0.02% (final concentration) NaN3 is added to each tube.b. Storage longer than 2 days was not tested; however for a better reproducibility it is recomended to proceed with the purification immediately after this step.15. The resin is packed into a 1.5×50 cm (D×L) column according to the manufacturers’ instructions, resulting in a column bed 1.5 cm in diameter and 46 cm in height. Note: The SEC column can be reused.16. The column is attached to the BioLogic LP System and equilibrated with 150-200 ml TBS at a flow rate of 2m l/m i n .17. Protein solution is then loaded and eluted in a 65m of buffer at 0.5ml/min at room temperature. Elution of protein was monitored by absorbance at 280~n m with the typical OD280 values of 0.01-0.2. SEC protocol:()18. The 1.5~ml fractions from the elution peak (approximately 75-90 min retention time) are collected and pooled as follows: fraction numbers 18-27 (pool I); 28-31 (pool II); 32-46 (pool III).Note: The pool II usually contains the Afp or its derivates with the least amount of cellular contaminants, while pool I and III contain less concentrated Afp particles with higher amounts of cellular contaminants. However, due to slight variations in column filling density, the fractions to be pooled have to be determined experimentally each time the column is repoured.19. The pooled SEC fractions containing Afp or its derivatives are centrifuged at 151, 139xg for one hour and 10 m i n at 4~^°C in a Beckman Optima TM L-100K ultracentrifuge (fixed angle). Notes:a.  It is helpful to label the outside of the tube where the pellet is likely to precipitate.b. The tube after the centrifugation has to be handled very carefully. Proceed to the next step immediately after the ultracentrifugation step to avoid disturbance of the pellet.20. After the centrifugation the supernatant is carefully removed using a pipette without disturbing the pellet but leaving approximatley 150-200 µl that was left enabbling the later resuspenssion of the pellet (Figure 1).Aspirate supernatant using pipetteLabelled outer side of the tube()Leave approximately 150-200 uL ofresidual buffer after aspiration. Transparent pellet (not visible)Figure  1.  Removing  supernatant  after  ultracentrifugation.  The supernatant  is removed using a pipette; approximately 150-300~ul covering the invisible pellet is left behind.21. The tube is incubated for 30-60 min at ^22^°C at 40 rpm, tilted with the labelled side down (Figure 2) in order to gently solubilise the pellet.# Residual buffer (150- 200 ul with the pellet)()Figure 2. Gentle resuspension of the pellet. The tube is placed as shown in the figure and gently agitated for 30-60 min .22. Following incubation, the often transparent retentate containing particles of interest is resuspended in residual buffer (usually approximately 150-200~ul) ) by pipetting up and down.23. The resuspended pellet is transferred to the 1.7ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 30 sec at 16,000~x~g . The pellet is discarded and supernatant is transferred to a new eppendorf tube with 0.02% sodium azide (final concentration) added. This preparation is used for visualizing Afp particles or its variants using transmission electron microscopy or for other applications.Note: Afp particles of approximately 70% purity can be purified using this method.B.   Negative staining and TEM of Afp and its variants1.  The grids are charged by using glow discharging following manufacturer’s instructions no longer than 15 min before applying a sample.2.  To visualise Afp and its variants, 3~ul of the re-suspended pellet is applied to a freshly glow-discharged plastic-coated 200-mesh grid.3.  The sample is allowed to settle for 60 sec.4.  Excess fluid is wicked off using Whatman #1 filter paper and then stained for 45 sec with a 0.7% filtered uranyl acetate (p H5.0) .Note: 0.5-1.0% can also be used.5.  The grid is left to air dry on a filter paper for 5-15min .6.  Grids are examined in a Morgagni 268D TEM at a nominal magnification of 70,000- 180,000 operated at 80 KeV following manufacturer’s instructions.

Expression of MGD1∆137-6His proteinThe protein construction here described is a truncated form of MGD1 (MGD1∆137-6His), deprived of its N-terminal 136 amino-acid residues and with a non-cleavable 6-histidine tag at the protein Cterminus. The deleted segment comprises the canonical N-terminal chloroplast signal peptide (res. 1-106; cleaved upon import to the organelle), and a 30-mer region predicted to be disordered, and not necessary for activity. The mgd1∆137 DNA fragment was cloned at the NdeI/NotI sites of the pET29b vector (Novagen, 69872), generating the pET29b-MGD1∆137-6His construct. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as host cells for protein production.1.  Prepare 1 L of sterile LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 u/ml) . Inoculate media with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pET29b-MGD1∆137-6His construct. Incubate culture at 37^°C and 180 rpm.2.  Monitor O D_600n m of culture on a UV/VIS spectrophotometer.3.  At O D_600n m0.6-0.8 , take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (before induction - T0). Centrifuge ( 13,000 x g_ 1 min), discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 40~ul of distilled water and 10ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.4.  Induce cells with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.25mM . Incubate 4h at 30^°C , 180 rpm.5.  After induction, take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (after induction - T4). Centrifuge (13,000× g,1m i n) , discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 80~ul of distilled water and 20ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.6.  Harvest cells by centrifugation ( 7,000× g for 20 min at 4^°C ).7.  Discard supernatant and store the pellet in a previously weighed 50ml Corning tube.8.  Weigh wet cell pellet and store at -20~^°C if not immediately used (typically 4/L culture).B.  IMAC purification of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Resuspend cell pellet in the lysis buffer (typically 5ml/g of cells). If cell resuspension is difficult, up to 10ml/ of cells of lysis buffer can be used.2.  Add Antifoam 204 (1-2 drops for 20ml ).3.  Disrupt cells on a Cell Disruption system at 1.5-1.8 kbar and incubate lysate for 20 min on ice. If lysate is too viscous upon disruption, add more Benzonase nuclease and/or increase incubation time on ice.4.  Spin lysate at 45,000xg for 30 min at 4^°C . Recover supernatant, dilute 2x in binding/washing buffer and further clarify it by filtration using a 0.2um filter.5.  Equilibrate the Histrap FF 1 ml (or 5m l for scale-up) with 5-10 CV (column volumes) of binding/washing buffer at 1 ml/min (2 ml/min on the 5 ml column).6.  Inject clarified lysate in the column at 1ml/min . Collect the column flow-through.7.  Wash column with the same buffer until Abs280nm is stable.8.  Wash column at 1ml/min overset2m/m i n on the 5ml column) with 5-10 CV of 8% elution buffer (40 mM imidazole) followed by 510CV of 16% ( 80m M imidazole) of the same solution.9.  Elute proteins at 1ml/min ( 2m l/m i n for the 5ml column) using a linear gradient from 16-100% of the same buffer 80-500~m M imidazole). Typically, gradient is performed for 10 min (15 min on the 5 ml column).10. Collect fractions (1 m) throughout all purification steps.11. Evaluate protein purity of MGD1∆137-6His containing fractions by SDS-PAGE analysis - take 16ul of sample and add 4ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.12. Evaluate protein homogeneity of MGD1∆137-6His containing fractions by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (see Note 7 for details).13. Pool appropriate fractions and concentrate up to 20m g/m l using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 Da concentrator (see Note 8 for details).14. Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDropTM 2000 spectrophotometer, using a sequence-derived extinction coefficient of 47,^900M^-1c m^-1 . Use 1:1 washing/elution buffer mix (imidazole)final 250m M as blank.C.  Size exclusion purification of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Equilibrate the Superdex S200 10/300 GL column with 2 CV (48 ml) of size exclusion buffer at 0.5–0.8m l/m i n (control that pressure does not exceed the maximum limit of 1.5M P a , otherwise decrease the flow).2.  Inject a maximum of 500ul of a 20m g/m l protein sample in the column.3.  Wash the column with the same buffer to elute proteins.4.  Collect 0.5ml fractions and perform SDS-PAGE and DLS analysis of the samples. For the SDSPAGE, take 16~ul of sample and add 4ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading. If samples are too viscous for gel loading, increase boiling and/or sonication times.5.  Wash the column with 2 CV of Mili-Q (MQ) water, followed by 2 CV of 20% ethanol.6.  Pool fractions containing pure and homogeneous MGD1∆137-6His protein.7.  Concentrate the protein to 10 m g/ m l using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 concentrator.8.  Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280~n m , using the size exclusion buffer as blank.9.  Prepare 40ul aliquots and store at -20~^°C , until further use.D.  Crystallization of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Prepare a protein stock solution at 6mg/ml (use the size exclusion buffer for dilution).2.  Prepare the precipitant solution containing 200mMM g C l_2.6H_2O and 22% (w/v) PEG 3350.3.  Pipet 400ul of precipitant solution into the reservoir(s) of the crystallization plate.4.  Prepare the crystallization drop(s) on the cover slip with 1 ul of MGD1  137-6His at 6m g/m l and 2ul of precipitant solution.5.  Place the cover slip over the well (drop facing reservoir) and seal.6.  Incubate plate at ^20^°C . Inspect the plate frequently, under a microscope (crystals appear in one week, but often grow bigger within 10-12 days). Avoid temperature changes and keep the plate at ^20^°C as much as possible.7.  Crystals cryoprotection is achieved in a two-step procedure (i) by transferring into a stabilizing solution of mother liquor (precipitant solution) containing 27% (w/v) PEG 3350 precipitant, (ii) followed by a quick soak in the same cryoprotective solution supplemented with 30% (W/v) of the same precipitant. Use the cryocrystallography material to mount and handle crystals.8.  Flash-cool and store crystals in LN2.# Notes1.  A more detailed explanation on the role of MGD1 in galactolipid biosynthesis is described in Rocha et al. (2013; 2016).2.  All solutions must be filtered prior to use. Solutions to be used in size exclusion chromatography have also to be degassed.3.  To accelerate cell growth, a pre-inoculum can be used. Prepare a small culture using the procedure described, and incubate overnight at 37~^°C , 180 rpm. Inoculate the new LB media with 2.3% of the overnight culture (typically 20-30~ml/L of media).4.  Length of column washing/equilibration steps can be adjusted (shortened or extended), by monitoring the stabilization of the absorbance at 280n m , as given by the AKTA FPLC system.5.  Because MGD1∆137-6His has a molecular weight of 45k D a , 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels can be used.6.  DTT can be used during the procedure, but for long-term storage TCEP is more stable and efficient.7.  DLS is an ideal technique for characterizing proteins in a variety of conditions and obtain information on their state in solution. It can be used to identify conditions that provide biologically relevant  oligomeric  structures,  ensure  monodispersity  and  optimal  stability,  minimize aggregation and ultimately, are ideal for crystallization. The default standard operation protocol (SOP) for protein size analysis of the Zetasizer Nano ZS^T M was used, with modifications to temperature ( y°0 or 20 ^°C_. ) and type of solvent used (e.g., water +~5% glycerol) to take into account the viscosity of the solution. Triplicate measurements are performed automatically. If the sample is monodisperse, only one population is seen (single peak), whereas polydispersity is represented by multiple populations (several peaks); also, the size distribution (peak width) around the protein diameter should be as narrow as possible; and finally the particle diameter should  be compatible with  the  protein  species  (very  large diameters  indicate  protein aggregation). A typical DLS experiment for MGD1, together with its expected results, can be found in Rocha et al. (2013), where the protein production optimized protocol was first published.8.  Throughout the purification, the appropriate fractions are determined according to their purity (SDS-PAGE) and homogeneity (DLS). MGD1∆137-6His fractions that are not very pure or not homogeneous are discarded from the pooling and not used in the following steps. Typically, fractions from the beginning and end of the eluted chromatographic peak are not included in the pooling.9.

Mutation and overexpressionSite directed mutagenesis by whole plasmid PCR was essentially carried out as described by Weiner et al. (1994).1.  The mutagenesis-PCR was setup as followed: 1.25ul wtClcF plasmid (6 kbp) (20n g/u l) 1.25ul forward Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) ) with the respective mutation site 1.25ul reverse Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) with the respective mutation site5 µl dNTP-Mix (2.5 mM)5 µl Pfu-Ultra buffer1 µl Pfu-Ultra 2.5 U/µl35.25 µl WaterPCR-Program:()2.  At the end the reaction was supplemented with 1/10 volume of 10× DpnI buffer and 10 U DpnI were added. The reaction was incubated at 37^°C for 1 h .3.  Afterwards 1.25ul of this mixture was transformed in ultracompetent E.coli DH5α.4.  Sequence integrity has to be proved by sequencing.5.  For expression purposes the plasmid with the codon sequence of ClcF or its mutants was transformed in E.coli BL21 (DE3)-CP-RIL.6.   For large scale protein production an overnight culture was setup with a colony from the transformation plate. The culture was incubated at 37~^°C and 250 rpm for 16~h in LB medium.7.  Afterwards 1 L LB medium was inoculated with the overnight culture in a ratio of 1/100 and further incubated at 37^°C and 250 rpm.8.  If the culture reached an optical density (OD600 nm) of 0.6 (app. 2-2.5 h) the protein production was induced by adding 1 M IPTG stock solution to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was further incubated for 4h at 30^°C .9.  After 4h induction the cells were harvested at 4,500× g for 25 min at 4^°C .10. The resulting pellet was resuspended in app. ^20ml wash buffer and again pelleted at 4,500xg for 45 min at 4^°C .11. The resulting pellet was stored at -20~^°C until further usage.# B.  PurificationTo get protein of sufficient puritiy eq95~% (estimated from a SDS-gel) a three step strategy including a heat precipitation followed by a two step column chromatography was necessary.1.  The cell pellet from 1 liter culture volume was resuspended in ^25ml lysis buffer. A 2 M MgCl2 stock solution was added to a final concentration of 3m M and 0.5 U DNase were used to the digest DNA.2.  Cells were disrupted using a precooled French Press at 1,500 Psi. The cells were passed three times through the French Press to ensure complete lysis.3.  The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 50,000× g for 1 h .4.  The supernatant was heated up to 65~^°C for 10 min in a water bath and afterwards cooled down on ice.5.  The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000× g for 1~h~ .6.  The resulting supernatant (app. ^25~ml ) was applied on a Q -sepharose, preequilibrated with IEX-A buffer.7.  The protein was applied on the column and the ClcF containing flowthrough (app. 30~ml ) was collected.8.  Solid ammonium sulfate (AMS) was added to a final concentration of 1.6 M to the flowthrough of the previous step (app. 6 g).9.  The resulting solution was applied on a Phenyl-sepharose preequilibrated with HIC buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 0 M AMS over 20 column volumes by means of an Aekta chromatography system. ClcF containing fractions were identified by activity assay as described in the underlying paper (Roth et al., 2013).10. ClcF containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 250 times the protein volume of 25~m M Tris (p H7.5) at 4^°C . The dialysis buffer is changed once after 12h .11. Prior crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 10 m g/ m l (determined using the Bradford assay) with a VivaSpin concentrator with a MWCO of 30,000 k D a at 4,000 xg. . Aliquots of the protein were directly frozen at -80~^°C till further usage.# C.  Crystallization1.  Based on the recipes of the commercial or published screens (e.g. sparse matrix, grid screen), all necessary buffer solution were prepared as stock solutions at a concentration of 1 M at the relevant pH Jancarik and Kim, 1991; Brzozowski and Walton, 2001; Hampton Research (see Reference 5); Jena Bioscience (see Reference 6).2.  All salt solutions and precipitant solutions were prepared as stock solutions at the highest concentration possible and filtered if applicable. For ClcF, 1 M Bis-Tris solutions with a p H6.0 and 7.0 with a spacing of 0.2 pH units are produced (pH adjusted with NaOH/HCl). Furthermore a 2 M MgCl2-solution and a solution of 50 % (w/v) PEG 3350 are necessary. All solutions are prepared with double distilled water.3.  The conditions of the respective screens were generated by mixing the appropriate stock solutions, previously prepared, in an Eppendorf tube.4.  A screen was setup by a pipetting robot with a reservoir of 90ul in a Greiner Crystalquick96 well crystallization plate.5.  Drops were setup by pipetting 0.2~ul reservoir solution and 0.2~uI protein solution respectively together. No further mixing is required. The plates are stored afterwards at 19~^°C . The plates were then regularly examined (in the first week every day, afterwards weekly) for crystal formation. Crystals usually appears between one day and up to 3 months, but occasionally even longer periods might be necessary to obtain crystals. If a promising condition (crystals, microcrystals or crystalline precipitate) was identified a fine screen was setup in a hanging drop 24 well format usually by varying the pH around the initial condition in a range of pm~1.5~p H units and the precipitant concentration within an applicable range (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Typical scheme for a 2-dimensional 24 well grid screen, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time6.  The reservoir was prepared as described and drops were setup with a total drop volume of 2~ul by mixing 1~ul protein with 1~ul reservoir over a reservoir of 500~ul in a 24 well Linbro crystallization plate.7.  For orthorhombic crystals of ClcF the screen, with a constant concentration of 0.4~M M g C l_2 in all conditions, is shown in Figure 2.()Figure 2. Typical screen for orthorhombic ClcF crystals, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time. In all conditions is M g C l_2 in a final concentration of 0.4 M.8.  For a complex the protein was premixed with 10m M substrate (5-chloromuconolactone), dissolved in a concentration of 1 M in water at pH 7 (adjusted with NaHCO3). No elongated  incubation  period  is  required  prior  crystallization.  The  setup  of  the crystallization plate was carried out as described.()Figure 3. Promising crystalline material within protein precipitate as starting point for further fine screens (left) and typical single crystals of ClcF (right). Further pictures could be found on the Hampton Research website (see Reference 5).D.  Cryoprotection1.  A condition with good looking crystals was chosen and the reservoir solution was prepared with 2% elevated precipitant concentration supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol.2.  Subsequently small amounts, 0.1 to 0.2ul of the cryosolution was added to the drop and the drop solution slowly exchanged against the cryosolution.3.  In the case of the complex the cryosolution contained the precipitant in a final concentration of 25% plus the ligand in a concentration of 10m M . No additional ethylene glycol is required.4.  Finally the crystals were fished with a nylon loop and plunged into liquid nitrogen.# Recipes1.

In the procedure, the MTSL probe is attached via a disulfide bond to a protein containing a single cysteine residue. NMR spectra are then acquired and interpreted to extract distance restraints. In order to interpret the NMR spectra, the backbone chemical shifts of the protein must first be obtained.()Figure 1. A flow chart of nitroxide labeling and representative PRE data. A.

Magnified regions showing the selective distance dependent line-broadening for the K499R1 (top) and E559R1 (bottom) probes. For each probe the diamagnetic and paramagnetic spectra are shown on the left and right panels, respectively. D. Representative PRE profile of the E559R1 probe data. Normalized intensity ratios (Iox/Ired) are shown as a function of residue number. The asterisk depicts the location of the probe. Errors of the ratio measurements are approximately 10-15% based on signal to noise of the NMR spectra, which can lead to values in excess of 1. Errors also can occur as a result of manipulating the sample (adding ascorbate to reduce the probe) and instrument instability. These errors are partially accounted for by adding pm5AA to the distance restraints that are obtained from the ratio data (Battiste and Wagner, 2000).A.  Assign the backbone chemical shifts of the native protein1.  Acquire a high quality 2D ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum of the native protein to be used as a reference (i.e., a spectrum containing the appropriate number of resolved cross-peaks based on the amino acid sequence of the protein).2.  Assign the backbone amide chemical shifts in the native protein using standard NMR procedures (for standard NMR experiments see Cavanagh et al., 1995).B.  Generate a protein mutant with a single cysteine residue1.  For these studies, the protein should contain a single cysteine residue. Check the protein’s primary sequence to determine if it contains native cysteine residues that could be inadvertently labeled by the nitroxide probe. If necessary, make conservative mutations to these cysteine residues to prevent non-specific labeling. If biochemical assays are available for the protein, they should be performed to ensure these mutations do not impair its function.2.  Choose the desired location in the protein to which the nitroxide probe will be attached. This location needs to be at a residue whose sidechain is solvent-exposed. The residue should be located in a structured loop or within defined secondary structure. This is important because if the probe is located in a structurally disordered region of the protein, the increased flexibility of the polypeptide backbone can reduce the quantitative strength of the technique.3.  Perform site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a single cysteine residue at the desired location to which the nitroxide probe will be attached.4.  Purify ^15N -labeled protein containing the cysteine mutation. Use buffers that are supplemented with 2.5mM DTT to prevent formation of inter-molecular disulfide bonds that can lead to protein aggregation (see Note 1). For a review on expression and purification of proteins see Gräslund et al. (2008).5.  Prior to labeling the purified cysteine mutant with MTSL, verify that the cysteine mutation does not affect the structure of the protein. This can be accomplished by comparing the ^1H-^15N- HSQC spectra of the mutant and native proteins. The chemical shift position of the cross-peaks in the spectra should be similar, with only localized changes occurring near the site of the mutation.C.  Site-specific labeling the proteinThe aim of the following steps is to label the ^1H_-^15N labeled purified cysteine mutant of the protein with MTSL. Care is taken to maintain the cysteine mutant under reducing conditions until it is modified with MTSL. The apparatus used to label the protein is shown in Figure 2, and consists of a conical tube and desalting column.()Figure 2. Schematic of the apparatus used to label proteins with MTSL1.  Buffer  exchange  the ^15N -labeled  cysteine  mutant  into  labeling  buffer  that  has  been supplemented with fresh 2.5m M DTT. The protein concentration should be at least 250-300uM .2.  Make a stock solution of MTSL by adding acetonitrile directly to the amber vial in which the MTSL was shipped. The final concentration of the stock solution should be 200m M MTSL. Store the MTSL stock solution at -20~^°C (see Notes 2 and 3).3.  Immediately before starting the labeling reaction, dilute the protein with labeling buffer to a final concentration of 250-300~uM protein. The final volume of the diluted protein solution should be 1 ml. The protein should be diluted with labeling buffer that does not contain DTT. From this step forward, all buffers used in this procedure should not contain DTT.4.  Equilibrate a Zeba spin desalting column with labeling buffer as per the manufacturer’sinstructions.5.  Construct the MTSL solution that will be used to label the protein. Pipette 2.5~m of labeling buffer into a clean 15m conical tube. Add MTSL from the stock solution to the conical tube. The amount added should be sufficient to achieve a final concentration of MTSL that is 10× the molar amount of protein that will be labeled (e.g., if the final concentration of protein in the reaction will be 300~uM then the concentration of MTSL should be 3m M ). Make sure to shield all MTSL solutions from light by covering the tube with foil first.6.  Construct the apparatus that will be used to label the protein (Figure 2). Place the equilibrateddesalting column into the conical tube from step C5. The column will rest above the MTSLcontaining solution and will leave room for the protein solution to flow through.# bio-protocol7.  Slowly pipette the protein onto the center of the column’s resin bed (Figure 2).8.  Centrifuge as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein will flow through the column and into the labeling solution, while DTT present in the protein solution will remain on the column. The process is considered complete after the elution of all the protein solution into the MTSL solution at the bottom of the collection tube. This will produce a solution located at the bottom of the conical tube that has a total volume of 3.5ml . Discard the desalting column.9.  Cover the conical tube containing the modification reaction with foil and let it incubate under agitation for 15m i n at room temperature.10. After 15 m i n , add additional MTSL from the stock solution to the modification reaction. The amount of added MTSL should yield a final concentration that is 20× greater than the protein’s concentration in the conical tube.11. Place tube back onto a rotating device and let the protein:MTSL mixture incubate under agitation overnight at room temperature (neginspace6h) .12. Buffer exchange the MTSL-labeled protein sample into the desired NMR buffer using a fresh Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter. This will remove any excess (unligated) MTSL (see Notes 4-6). As mentioned above, the NMR buffer should not contain any DTT.13. Verify that the protein is labeled with MTSL by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As compared to the unligated protein, the mass of the modified protein should increase by 186 Da (the weight of the attached probe). Although MALDI-TOF is not quantitative, in the mass spectrum >90% of the protein should be labeled with MTSL. If biochemical assays are available for the protein, they should be performed on labeled protein to verify that MTSL attachment does not impair its function.14. For NMR studies, the MTSL modified protein should have a final concentration of 300uM (see Note 7). The NMR buffer should contain 8–10% D2O, but be devoid of any DTT. Place the sample in a standard NMR tube and shield from light using foil.# D.  NMR data acquisition1.  Use a standard 2D- ^1H-^15N -HSQC pulse sequence to acquire a spectrum of the freshly MTSLlabeled protein. Typically, the ^1H and ^15N dimensions are defined by 2,048 and 256 complex points, respectively. At this time, the sample is in its paramagnetic state. Its spectrum should be well dispersed, indicating that the modified protein is folded and not aggregating.2.  Make a stock solution of 250m M sodium ascorbate by dissolving it in NMR buffer.3.  After the ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum has been acquired of the paramagnetic protein (step D1), remove the NMR tube from the magnet. Using a long pipette that fits into the NMR tube, add sodium ascorbate to a final concentration that is 5× greater than the concentration of the labeled protein. This step should be performed carefully, by pipetting the solution up and down slowly so as to mix the solution, while preventing any sample loss. Addition of sodium ascorbate will reduce MTSL’s unpaired electron to form the diamagnetic state. Let the sample reduce for a minimum of 3h at room temperature (no agitation is needed).4.  Acquire a ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum of the reduced diamagnetic MTSL:protein sample using acquisition parameters that are identical to those used to acquire the paramagnetic spectrum described in step D1.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Assign Backbone Chemical Shifts of Native Protein\nAcquire a high-quality 2D 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the native protein to be used as a reference.\nAssign the backbone amide chemical shifts in the native protein using standard NMR procedures.\n## Generate Protein Mutant with Single Cysteine Residue\nCheck the protein's primary sequence to determine if it contains native cysteine residues that could be inadvertently labeled by the nitroxide probe.\nMake conservative mutations to these cysteine residues to prevent non-specific labeling, if necessary.\nChoose the desired location in the protein to which the nitroxide probe will be attached.\nPerform site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a single cysteine residue at the desired location.\nPurify 15N-labeled protein containing the cysteine mutation.\nVerify that the cysteine mutation does not affect the structure of the protein by comparing the 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of the mutant and native proteins.\n## Site-Specific Labeling of Protein\nBuffer exchange the 15N-labeled cysteine mutant into labeling buffer supplemented with fresh 2.5mM DTT.\nMake a stock solution of MTSL by adding acetonitrile directly to the amber vial.\nDilute the protein with labeling buffer to a final concentration of 250-300uM.\nEquilibrate a Zeba spin desalting column with labeling buffer.\nConstruct the MTSL solution to be used for labeling.\nConstruct the apparatus for labeling the protein.\nSlowly pipette the protein onto the center of the column's resin bed.\nCentrifuge as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nCover the conical tube containing the modification reaction with foil and let it incubate under agitation.\nAdd additional MTSL from the stock solution to the modification reaction.\nLet the protein:MTSL mixture incubate under agitation overnight at room temperature.\nBuffer exchange the MTSL-labeled protein sample into the desired NMR buffer.\nVerify that the protein is labeled with MTSL by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.\nPerform biochemical assays on labeled protein to verify that MTSL attachment does not impair its function, if available.\n## NMR Data Acquisition\nAcquire a 2D 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the freshly MTSL-labeled protein.\nMake a stock solution of 250mM sodium ascorbate by dissolving it in NMR buffer.\nAdd sodium ascorbate to the NMR tube to reduce MTSL's unpaired electron.\nAcquire a 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the reduced diamagnetic MTSL:protein sample.","evidence_ids":["Bio-protocol-3002","Bio-protocol-2448","Protocol.io-8527","Bio-protocol-542","Protocol.io-8180","Protocol.io-8117","Protocol.io-8116","Protocol.io-8115","Protocol.io-7097","Protocol.io-8099"]}

Saccharomyces cerevisiaeS. cerevisiae cells are unable to incorporate BrdU into DNA because they lack the nucleotide salvage pathway that enables uptake of extracellular thymidine or its analogs. To circumvent this problem, strains for molecular combing have been engineered to ectopically express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter, inserted at the URA3 locus on chromosome V (strain PP872; genetic background: W303; genotype: MATa, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ura3, GAL, psi+, RAD5, ura3::URA3-GPDTK7) (Lengronne et al., 2001; Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006). Cells bearing one integrated copy of the HSV-TK ^+ hENT1 vector (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) (Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006) show comparable levels of BrdU incorporation to cells with seven copies of HSV-TK alone (Bianco et al., 2012).Note: DNA molecular combing procedure doesn’t differ for fission yeast excepted for growth and labelling conditions (Kaykov et al., 2016).1.  BrdU labeling of synchronized HU-arrested cells and preparation of DNA genomic plugsa.  Grow cells overnight at _25°0 to a density of 5×10^6 cells/ml in 100ml of YPAD.b.  Add a -factor (2u/mI) at  T_0 in order to synchronized cells in G1. A second (4u/ml) and a third dose (2u/mI) of a -factor are added part way at respectively T_1h and T_2h to ensure that cells do not escape the G_1 arrest. Note: The length of G_1 synchronisation varies from 2.5 to 3h depending on the doubling time of yeast strains. Make sure that cells are in G_1 (unbudded cells) before the release into S phase (Figure 1).c.  Add (i) BrdU to a final concentration of 400ugim/ml (or 40ugim/ml if cells express the nucleotide transporter hENT1), and (ii) Hydroxyurea (HU, 200~m M_ ) at least 15 m i n before releasing cells into S phase. Note: Elongation from early-firing origins is inhibited with the addition of HU in order to restrict the length of newly replicated regions to 10k b .d.  Release cells from α-factor arrest into S phase by addition of 50 u/m l Pronase (degrades alpha factor peptide in medium). Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.0 with potassium phosphate buffer.e.  After 90min , collect cells by centrifugation at 4^°C ; 1,096xg in a 50ml tube containing cold 0.1% NaN3 (sodium azide). Note: Sodium azide inhibits cytochrome oxidase (last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria or bacteria) by binding irreversibly to the heme cofactor and stops all cell metabolism, including DNA replication.f.  Resuspend the cells in one volume of cold TE50, 0.1% NaN3 and keep them on ice. Check cells under a microscope (Nikon YS100). More than 90% of the cells should display small buds, which are indicative of entry into S phase (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Yeast cell morphology in G_1 and early S phase. A. G1 synchronised yeast cells; B. Yeast cells in S phase + H U after release from G1 for 90 m i n .2.  Preparation of genomic DNA plugs Genomic DNA is prepared in low melting point (LMP) agarose plugs to prevent mechanical shearing.a.  Freshly prepare molten 2% LMP agarose in bi-distilled water and Zymolyase buffer. Keep at 42^°C in thermomixer until use.b.  Determine cell concentration with a cell counter.c.  Wash cells once with NZ buffer.d.  Resuspend cells in prewarmed Zymolyase buffer (42^°C) to a final concentration of 4×10^8 cells/ml and carefully mixed with an equal volume of molten 2% LMP agarose (42^°C) . Note: The Zymolyase will digest the cell wall.e.  Transfer the cellular suspension into a plug mold sealed with tape to generate 90~ul plugs (Figure 2) containing 2×10^7 cells or approximately 350 ng of genomic DNA per plug at room temperature. Note: Prepare at least 4 plugs per sample.f.  Cover molds with a plastic film (Figure 2) and incubate for 30 min at 37^°C .()Figure 2. Pictures of a plug mold. A and B. Top and bottom views; C. Plug mold sealed with a tape and covered with a saran plastic film.g.  Place agarose plugs at 4 °C for 10 min to let the agarose solidify.h.  Transfer plugs into 14ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes using a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb and incubate them at 37^°C in Proteinase K buffer (2 ml for 4 plugs) for 1 h under gentle agitation. Transfer plugs into fresh Proteinase K buffer and incubate for ^24~h~ at 37~^°C . Repeat once for an additional ^24h . Note: Incubation with P K buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching.i. Wash plugs for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on a roller mixer at room temperature. Change the buffer from time to time.j. Keep plugs at 4~^°C in TE50 buffer until use (stable for months). Note that DNA plugs are translucent and fragile.# bio-protocol# B.  Human cellsNote: This protocol is available for any kind of mammalian cells.1.  BrdU labelling and preparation of DNA genomic plugs Unlike budding yeast, human cells cannot be easily synchronized and experiments are usually performed with asynchronous cultures. Under these conditions, it is critical to use a combination of two modified nucleotides (IdU and CldU) to determine the polarity of replication forks and the position of initiation sites (Figure 3). (Conti et al., 2007)()Figure 3. Schematic patterns obtained by DNA combing after IdU/CldU pulses in asynchronous mammalian cells. To determine fork velocity, green tracks adjacent to red tracks are measured in B, C, E. Stalled forks are represented in A and E and interorigin distances (IOD) in B and D. ORI: origin of replication. Arrows indicate fork direction. F. Schematic pattern obtained by DNA combing after BrdU pulse in synchronized budding yeast cells.a.  Grow cells to a confluence of about 70% in 6-well plates. At the time of the experiment each well need to contain a minimum of 1×10^5 cells.b.  Label cells by adding IdU ( 20uM final) directly in 2 ml medium.c.  Incubate cells at 37^°C for at least 10 min.d.  Replace medium with ^2mI of prewarmed medium containing 200~uM CldU. Incubate cells at 37^°C for 20m i n . Note: To avoid thermal shock and other perturbations, add nucleotides directly to growth medium (first pulse). Use prewarmed medium and a much higher concentration for the second pulse to avoid washes. The range of IdU/CldU staining time should be adjusted for each cell line from 10 to 30 min depending on S phase duration.e.  Rinse cells with PBS and trypsinize cells as usual, adjust trypsinization time to cell type. For instance, incubate cells for 3-5 min in 0.05% trypsin, 1 mM EDTA.f.  Collect cells, place them on ice and spin for 5 min at 1,000 xg at 4^°C . Keep the cells on ice until use (to stop DNA synthesis).# 2.  Preparation of genomic DNA plugsa.  Resuspend cells in 5ml cold PBS, spin for 5 min at 1,000 xg at 4^°C and resuspend in 1 ml cold PBS.b.  Count cells and resuspend at 8×10^5 to 2×10^6 cells/ml in cold PBS, depending on cell size.c.  Prepare a solution of 2% LMP agarose in PBS and keep at 42^°C until use.d.  Add an equal volume of 2% LMP agarose to cells. To prepare 4 plugs, add 200~ul of 2% LMP agarose solution to 200ul of prewarmed cells solution.e.  Mix very gently with a P1000 pipetman (optional: cut tip).f.  Transfer 90ul per plug into a plug mold sealed with tape.g.  Let plugs solidify for 25 min at room temperature and for 10 min at 4^°C .h.  Use a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb to eject plugs into 14ml round-bottom tubes containing 0.5ml of Proteinase K buffer per plug. Mix gently on roller mixer and change the PK buffer after 1 h.i.  Incubate for 48h at 37~^°C . Change the PK solution twice more during this incubation. Mix gently on a roller mixer. Note: Incubation with P K buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching.j. Gently remove the solution by blocking the agarose plug with a cell scraper. Plugs are transparent and difficult to manipulate after PK treatment.k.  Wash plugs several times for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on the roller mixer at room temperature.l.  Store at 4^°C in TE50 until use. Genomic DNA is stable for months at 4^°C in T E_50 buffer.# bio-protocolC.  Procedures common to yeast and human cells1.  Melting of agarose plugs containing genomic DNAa.  Transfer a plug in a 12ml round-bottom tube. Plugs are washed 3 times for 1 h in 1x TE pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl.b.  After removing of the last wash, add 100 μl 1x TE and 1.5ul YOYO-1 to stain genomic DNA. Keep in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Note: YOYO staining is lost after DNA denaturation but is used to check combing before detection.c.  Wash 4 times for 5 min with 10 ml 1x TE with gentle shaking.d.  Wash once for 5 min with 2 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl.e.  Replace with 3 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl. Note: Increase the volume of MES if fiber density is too high after combing. The pH of MES is critical to obtain a correct density and stretching of DNA fibers.f.  Incubate for 15-30 min for human cells and 45 min for yeast cells at 67^°C in a heating block. Note: From now on, manipulate samples with extreme care to avoid DNA shearing.g.  Check the DNA solution. If the shape of the plug is still visible, put it back at 67~^°C until complete melting.h.  Let the solution cool down to 42^°C before adding  -agarase (3 U per plug).i. Incubate overnight at 42^°C .j. Visually inspect the DNA solution. If you still see agarose aggregates; add  -agarase (1 U per plug) for 2 more hours.k.  Incubate at 65^°C for 10 min and store at room temperature in dim light until use.# 2.  DNA combingDNA combing is performed on silanized coverslips as described (Bensimon et al., 1994; Lengronne et al., 2001; Michalet et al., 1997). The quality of silanized coverslips is critical for the subsequent analysis of replication profiles. The whole procedure using the genomic vision device can be visualized on this video: https://youtu.be/LjjpYby3YIk.a.  Carefully pour the DNA solution into a 2 ml Teflon reservoir. Save the rest for further use. Note: Genomics Vision sells disposable 2 ml plastic reservoirs to melt plug directly in the reservoir and avoid manipulation of the DNA solution.b.  Insert a silanized coverslip into the DNA solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.c.  Using a DNA combing device, remove carefully the coverslip from the reservoir at a constant speed of 300um/sec . Repeat with another coverslip as many times as needed (2 slides per sample is usually sufficient).d.  At this stage, DNA is stretched on both sides of the coverslip. Visualize DNA fibers on one side under the microscope (Nikon YS100) using a 40× objective and a FITC filter block. To this aim, fix with tape the coverslip to a metal coverslip holder, put a drop of immersion oil directly on the coverslip to visualize DNA fibers.e.  Place the coverslip on a sheet of Whatman paper to soak up oil and bake for ^z_h at 60~^°C to crosslink DNA to coverslips.f.  Stick the oiled side of coverslips on glass slides with cyanoacrylate glue. Label slides with a diamond tip engraving pen and store at -20~^°C until use. Note: If needed, some steps presented in A2/B2 and C1/C2 sections can be modified to increase the length of stretched DNA molecules as described (Kaykov et al., 2016). If the density of fibers is too low, the DNA solution can be kept for a few days at 4^°C to increase DNA resuspension in MES buffer before combing.# 3.  ImmunodetectionSpecific combinations of primary and secondary antibodies are used to detect BrdU or CldU/IdU and DNA fibers simultaneously.a.  Dehydrate slides for 5 min in successive baths of 70% , 90% and 100% ethanol in Coplin jar. Let air dry the slides.b.  Incubate in Coplin jar for 25 min in freshly prepared 1 N NaOH to denature the DNA duplex. Note: Prolonged incubation in NaOH degrades the silane layer and should be avoided.c.  Wash extensively with PBS pH 7.4 to neutralize NaOH (5 washes of 1 min each).d.  Saturate slides for 15 min in PBS/T containing 1% BSA.e.  Add 20~ul of PBS/T containing primary antibodies and cover with a coverslip. Incubate for 45 min at 37^°C in a humid chamber.f.  Wash 5 min ×2 times with PBS/T in Coplin jar. Note: Dip slide in a Coplin jar containing PBS/T in order to remove the upper coverslip without damaging the DNA fibers.g.  Detect with secondary antibodies (30 min at 37^°C in a humid chamber).h.  Wash 5 min x 3 times with PBS/T in Coplin Jar.i. Air dry slides and mount by adding 5ul Prolong Gold Antifade reagent on coverslip covered with a second coverslip. Let mounting reagent polymerize for at least ^2~h~ at room temperature (preferably overnight and protect from light) before proceeding with microscopy. Mounted coverslips are stable for months at -20~^°C .# 4.  Image acquisition and data analysisa.  Image acquisition is performed with a 40× objective on a motorized microscope equipped with a camera and controlled with Zeiss ZEN Pro 2 software or equivalent (Figure 4). The conversion factor (CF) from pixel to bp (C F=P/M×S) depends on the pixel size of the CCD camera (P in mu m ), on the magnification of the objective (M) and on the stretching of DNA fibers ( 5,2k b/u m for DNA combing). DNA molecules of known length, such as concatemers of bacteriophage lambda DNA, can be used as size standards.b.  BrdU tracks and DNA fibers can be measured manually with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) or open source software such as ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Data are transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. DNA fiber identification and length measurements can be automated with software like IDeFIx, developed by the DNA combing facility of# bio-protocolMontpellier (IGMM, CNRS) or software developed by Genomic Vision. Critical issues regarding potential biases and limitations of DNA fiber analysis have been extensively discussed elsewhere (Techer et al., 2013; Tuduri et al., 2010).()Figure 4. Representative examples of replication patterns observed by DNA combing. Aand B. Yeast cells were released from G1 in the presence of 200 mM HU and labeled with BrdU for 90 min. DNA fibers were purified and stretched by DNA combing. BrdU and ssDNA were detected as indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. C and D. Human cells were labeled for 15 min with IdU and 60 min with CldU. The combination of antibodies used to detect IdU, CldU and ssDNA is indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. Image acquisition is performed with a motorized Leica DM6000B microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (6.45um/pixel) and a 40× oil immersion objective. With this setup and a DNA stretching of 2k b/u m , one pixel corresponds to (6.45/40)×2=323b p.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nS. cerevisiae cells are unable to incorporate BrdU into DNA because they lack the nucleotide salvage pathway that enables uptake of extracellular thymidine or its analogs.\nStrains for molecular combing have been engineered to ectopically express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter, inserted at the URA3 locus on chromosome V.\nCells bearing one integrated copy of the HSV-TK+ hENT1 vector show comparable levels of BrdU incorporation to cells with seven copies of HSV-TK alone.\n## BrdU Labeling of Synchronized HU-Arrested Cells and Preparation of DNA Genomic Plugs\n## Cell Growth and Synchronization\nGrow cells overnight at 25°C to a density of 5×10^6 cells/ml in 100ml of YPAD.\nAdd α-factor (2μM) at T0 to synchronize cells in G1.\nAdd a second (4μM) and a third dose (2μM) of α-factor at T1h and T2h to ensure that cells do not escape the G1 arrest.\n## BrdU Labeling\nAdd BrdU to a final concentration of 400μg/ml (or 40μg/ml if cells express the nucleotide transporter hENT1).\nAdd Hydroxyurea (HU, 200mM) at least 15 minutes before releasing cells into S phase.\n## Cell Release and Collection\nRelease cells from α-factor arrest into S phase by addition of 50μM Pronase.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 4°C;
