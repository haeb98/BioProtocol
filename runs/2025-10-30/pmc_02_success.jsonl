Thus, the mice response (i.e., licking and flinching) is assessed after a subcutaneous injection of formalin normally in the plantar hind paw (Tjolsen et al., 1992). The test was originally described in the late seventies (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977), and, initially, it consisted of the injection of 50~ul of 5% formalin in the dorsal surface of one forepaw of a rat or a cat. Since then, the formalin test has been extensively used to assess nociception and inflammation-related responses, thus being adapted according to each study’s aim. Mice and rats are frequently used due to their innate grooming behaviour (i.e., forepaw licking). Accordingly, a 2.5% formalin (in physiological saline solution) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the rodent hind paw is commonly used to induce nociceptive responses (i.e., paw ‘flinching’ and licking) lasting for 45-90 min (Tjolsen et al., 1992).", "biop_hier_len": "37", "biop_abstract": "Pain research is mostly based on experimental assays that use animal models, which may allow deciphering the physiopathology of this condition and to propel drug discovery.

This test permits monitoring pain-related responses (i.e., itch) caused by a subcutaneous injection of an inflammatory agent, namely 2.5% formalin solution, in the hind paw. After the injection, two distinct time periods or phases of licking/biting behaviour occur, which are separated by a quiescent period. Importantly, these phases differ in duration and underlying mechanisms. Hence, the initial acute phase (phase I), commonly recorded for 5 min just after formalin administration, reflects acute peripheral pain, probably due to direct activation of nociceptors through TRPA1 channels. On the other hand, the phase II, which starts after the quiescent period (5.15m i n) ) and is commonly recorded for 15-30 min , is due to the ongoing inflammatory input and central nociceptive sensitization.

One layer of this pocket, the ‘disc proper’, is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that is heavily folded at the onset of metamorphosis. It is continuous with the ‘overlaying’ squamous epithelium, the peripodial membrane. The focus of our work is to understand how the Wnt morphogen patterns the dome-shaped wing pouch region of the wing disc. As imaginal discs are flat overall, conventional imaging has them mounted for top-down or upside-down observation, whereby cover-slips compress and distort the folded structure. The use of spacers prevents distortions, but imaging of the entire wing pouch using Z-stacks has proved unsatisfactory or impossible; as outlined above, the reduced resolution in the Z-axis typically prevents high-resolution reconstruction of the epithelium in the apical/basal direction. Therefore, only the apical half of the epithelium of the wing pouch is detected at high resolution. This problem is exacerbated if weak signals are to be detected. Thus, uniform imaging requires a ‘side-view’ that can be obtained in sections.

However, the XY plane of interest can be chosen if embedded samples are precisely oriented and sectioned prior to imaging (Figure 1).

Although the trypanosomatids multiply predominantly by clonal generation, the presence of DNA exchange in some of them has been puzzling researchers over the years, mainly because it may represent a novel form that these organisms use to gain variability. Analysis of DNA Exchange using Thymidine Analogs (ADExTA) is a method that allows the in vitro detection and measurement of rates of DNA exchange, particularly in trypanosomatid cells, in a rapid and simple manner by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The method can be used to detect DNA exchange within one trypanosomatid lineage or among different lineages by paired analysis. The principle of this assay is based on the incorporation of two distinguishable halogenated thymidine analogs called 5_^ -chloro- .2: - deoxyuridine (CldU) and 5^. -iodo- .2^. -deoxyuridine (IdU) during DNA replication. After mixing the two cell cultures that had been previously incorporated with CldU and IdU separately, the presence of these unusual deoxynucleosides in the genome can be detected by specific antibodies. For this, a DNA denaturation step is required to expose the sites of thymidine analogs incorporated. Subsequently, a secondary  reaction  using  fluorochrome-labeled  antibodies  will  generate  distinct  signals  under fluorescence analysis. By using this method, DNA exchange verification (i.e., the presence of both CldU and IdU in the same cell) is possible using a standard fluorescence microscope. It typically takes 2-3 days from the thymidine analogs incorporation to results. Of note, ADExTA is relatively cheap and does not require transfections or harsh genetic manipulation. These features represent an advantage when compared to other time-consuming protocols that demand DNA manipulation to introduce distinct drugresistance markers in different cells for posterior selection.", "out_path": "data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC4288695.xml", "ok": true}

The development and early testing of the method are described in Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2017. Here, we present a protocol for establishment and evaluation of the fly stocks that can be used for functional annotation of genes in a tissue-specific manner throughout the development of Drosophila. The method, called “Flip-flop”, is built upon the versatile Minos mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) platform (Venken et al., 2011; Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015a and 2015b) and involves genomic integration of the “Flip-flop cassette” that contains two modules: a protein-trap (PT) module and a genetrap (GT) module (Figure 1A). The PT-module tags the gene of interest with EGFP at the endogenous locus, whereas the GT module facilitates generation of truncation mutants that express mCherry under the control of the natural regulatory elements of the gene. Once the cassette is inserted in a coding intron in the PT orientation, it can be reversed into the opposite GT-orientation in vivo with the help of FLP. The inversion marks the mutant cells, as they express mCherry under the endogenous gene’s control, and helps distinguish them from the rest of the tissue expressing EGFP tagged protein (Figure 1B). There are several advantages of Flip-flop over the traditional method MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker; Lee and Luo, 1999): First, the control cells and the mutant cells are marked with EGFP and mCherry respectively, and the reporters are expressed at the endogenous level.

To address this issue, we developed “Flip-flop”, a novel, Flippase-dependent in vivo cassette-inversion method that functions independent of mitosis, and therefore can be used for gene inactivation in both mitotic as well as postmitotic cells. This method allows tagging protein-coding genes with EGFP and generates mutant cells that are marked with mCherry upon cassette inversion. Here, we describe protocols for generation and validation of fly lines that can be used for conditional gene inactivation in mitotic as well as post-mitotic cells.

During infection, bacteria found in a biofilm community are less sensitive to antibiotics and to the immune response, often allowing them to colonize and persist in the host niche. Not surprisingly, biofilm formation on medical devices, such as urinary catheters, is a major problem in hospital settings. To be able to eliminate such biofilms, it is important to understand the key bacterial factors that contribute to their formation. A common practice in the lab setting is to study biofilms grown in laboratory media. However, these media do not fully reflect the host environment conditions, potentially masking relevant biological determinants. This is the case during urinary catheterization, where a key element for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization and biofilm formation is the release of fibrinogen (Fg) into the bladder and its deposition on the urinary catheter. To recapitulate bladder conditions during catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), we have developed a fibrinogen-coated catheter and 96-well plate biofilm assay in urine. Notably, enterococcal biofilm factors identified in these in vitro assays proved to be important for biofilm formation in vivo in a mouse model of CAUTI.

Here we describe a novel method to rapidly suppress gene expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) applied to rodent brain slices in an “Oslo-type” interface chamber. The method has three advantageous features: 1) rapid blockade of new synthesis of the targeted proteins that avoids genetic compensation, 2) efficient oxygenation of the brain slice, which is critical for reproducing in vivo conditions of long-term synaptic plasticity, and 3) a recirculation system that uses only small volumes of bath solution (<5m l) , reducing the amount of reagents required for long-term experiments lasting many hours. The method employs a custom-made recirculation system involving piezoelectric micropumps and was first used for the acute translational blockade of protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) synthesis during long-term potentiation (LTP) by Tsokas et al., 2016. In that study, applying antisense-ODN rapidly prevents the synthesis of PKMζ and blocks late-LTP without inducing the compensation by other protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that occurs in PKCζ/PKMζ knockout mice. In addition, we show that in a low-oxygenation submersion-type chamber, applications of the atypical PKC inhibitor, zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), can result in unstable baseline synaptic transmission, but in the high-oxygenation, “Oslo-type” interface electrophysiology chamber, the drug reverses late-LTP without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. This comparison reveals that the interface chamber, but not the submersion chamber, reproduces the effects of ZIP in vivo. Therefore, the protocol combines the ability to acutely block new synthesis of specific proteins for the study of long-term synaptic plasticity, while maintaining properties of synaptic transmission that reproduce in vivo conditions relevant for long-term memory.", "out_path": "data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC2790841.xml", "ok": true}

However, the challenge remains, particularly in the conformational transition and dynamics study area where a much higher quantity of the receptors and G proteins is required even in comparison to X-ray and cryo-EM (5 mg/ml, 3 μl/sample) when NMR spectroscopy (5~m g/m l,~250~ul) /sample) is applied. As a result, the expression levels of the insect and mammalian systems are also difficult to meet this demand, not to mention the prohibitive cost of producing GPCRs and G proteins using these systems for a vast majority of laboratories. Therefore, exploration of an effective, affordable, and practical approach with broad applicability is demanded. Pichia pastoris expression system has shown its promise in the GPCR preparation with many merits that other eukaryotic expression systems can’t compete with. GPCRs expressed in this system are inexpensive, easy-to-manipulate, and capable of isotopically labeling.

The thiamine-repressed nmt calI^+ promoter is the most popular regulatable system used in fission yeast (Forsburg, 1993). This promoter system has a fast rate of repression but takes 14-20~h~ to induce mRNA expression (Maundrell, 1990). To transcend the limits of existing systems, I had designed the pTIN-system (Garg, 2020). Here, the n m t1^+ promoter directs synthesis of the nc-tgp1 lncRNA, which is 5' -adjacent to the tgp  I^+ promoter. The tgp I^+ promoter in turn guides the synthesis of the gene of interest (GOI). In thiamine-starved conditions, lncRNA transcription interferes with the tgp calI^+ promoter and represses expression of the GOI. Inclusion of thiamine shuts off lncRNA synthesis and allows GOI expression. The pTIN-overexpression system has (i) rapid induction with maximal mRNA expression within an hour after the addition of thiamine, (ii) 60-fold dynamic range, and (iii) tunable expression by varying thiamine concentration in the medium (Garg, 2020).
