This method is based on highly efficient yeast-based in vivo cloning, and the subsequent cloning of the constructed plasmids into E. coli. Our method is useful for various applications: multifragment DNA cloning, cloning of large DNA fragments, and cloning into large plasmid vectors. Furthermore, the sites at which DNA fragments are joined are not always located at the restriction ends in the plasmid vector, thus making the cloning method more flexible. Our system does not require manipulation for assembling or joining DNA fragments in a test tube, the efficiency of which may sometimes depend on the reaction conditions or the skills of the person performing the procedure. Therefore, both success rate and efficiency are extremely high. However, our system has a disadvantage in that it requires 2 steps for transformation. Our method is an improved version of previously developed methods (Iizasa and Nagano, 2006; Nagano et al., 2007). Next figure shows the flowchart of our method."

Here, we provide a protocol for the isolation and culture of neuron-glial cells from cortical tissues of 1-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley pups. The procedure makes available an easier way to obtain the neuron and glia. In this culture system, neuron-glia cultures consisted of approximately 37% neurons, 51% astrocytes, 7% microglia, and a small percentage (<5%) of other cells after fourteen days in vitro. Primary neuron-glia cultures is a simplified in vitro model for studies focusing on interactions between neurons and glia cells. Activated glial cells, mainly astrocytes and microglia, are histopathological hallmarks of acute injury of the central nervous system (CNS) or chronic neurologic diseases (Hirsch and Hunot, 2009; Lee et al., 2009; Minghetti, 2005). Inflammatory mediators (e.g., nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines) released by activated glia can directly or indirectly cause neuronal damage or neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation is a common mechanism of various neurological diseases leading to neurodegeneration. The advantages of neuron-glia cultures are that: (1) Cultured cells can bypass complicated physiological interactions (such as leukocyte infiltration, blood-brain barrier, reflex or other systemic regulation) in vivo to allow direct observation of neuroinflammation caused by various CNS insults (hypoxia, ischemia, trauma. infection, neurotoxins, chronic stress or diseases); (2) Unlike cell lines that are mostly derived from tumor cells, primary cultured neuron-glia system is closer to the cell population ratio in vivo and can mimic the in situ microenvironment; and (3) Cultures  can  be  prepared  from  various  brain  regions  (e.g.,  cortex,  hippocampus, mesencephalon…etc) and allow an opportunity to examine the regional difference in the susceptibility to neurodegeneration following neuroinflammation caused by various CNS insults (Kim et al., 2000).

There are methods available to detect GSH accurately however; due to readily oxidative conversion of GSH into GSSG most of the methods give an overestimate of GSSG. Cohen and Lyle (1966) solved the problem by using NEM to prevent oxidative conversion of GSH into GSSG and also preventing GSH to react with OPT during GSSG estimation (Figures 1 and 2). We have used this simple and reliable method to detect GSH and GSSG in our experimental system (microglial cell lysate).

Thus, the mice response (i.e., licking and flinching) is assessed after a subcutaneous injection of formalin normally in the plantar hind paw (Tjolsen et al., 1992). The test was originally described in the late seventies (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977), and, initially, it consisted of the injection of 50~ul of 5% formalin in the dorsal surface of one forepaw of a rat or a cat. Since then, the formalin test has been extensively used to assess nociception and inflammation-related responses, thus being adapted according to each study’s aim. Mice and rats are frequently used due to their innate grooming behaviour (i.e., forepaw licking). Accordingly, a 2.5% formalin (in physiological saline solution) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the rodent hind paw is commonly used to induce nociceptive responses (i.e., paw ‘flinching’ and licking) lasting for 45-90 min (Tjolsen et al., 1992).",37,"Pain research is mostly based on experimental assays that use animal models, which may allow deciphering the physiopathology of this condition and to propel drug discovery. The formalin nociception test is considered one of the most predictive approaches to study acute pain in rodents. This test permits monitoring pain-related responses (i.e., itch) caused by a subcutaneous injection of an inflammatory agent, namely 2.5% formalin solution, in the hind paw. After the injection, two distinct time periods or phases of licking/biting behaviour occur, which are separated by a quiescent period. Importantly, these phases differ in duration and underlying mechanisms. Hence, the initial acute phase (phase I), commonly recorded for 5 min just after formalin administration, reflects acute peripheral pain, probably due to direct activation of nociceptors through TRPA1 channels. On the other hand, the phase II, which starts after the quiescent period (5.15m i n) ) and is commonly recorded for 15-30 min , is due to the ongoing inflammatory input and central nociceptive sensitization.

One layer of this pocket, the ‘disc proper’, is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that is heavily folded at the onset of metamorphosis. It is continuous with the ‘overlaying’ squamous epithelium, the peripodial membrane. The focus of our work is to understand how the Wnt morphogen patterns the dome-shaped wing pouch region of the wing disc. As imaginal discs are flat overall, conventional imaging has them mounted for top-down or upside-down observation, whereby cover-slips compress and distort the folded structure. The use of spacers prevents distortions, but imaging of the entire wing pouch using Z-stacks has proved unsatisfactory or impossible; as outlined above, the reduced resolution in the Z-axis typically prevents high-resolution reconstruction of the epithelium in the apical/basal direction. Therefore, only the apical half of the epithelium of the wing pouch is detected at high resolution. This problem is exacerbated if weak signals are to be detected. Thus, uniform imaging requires a ‘side-view’ that can be obtained in sections. We modified a cryosection protocol (Culbertson et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2012) to obtain transverse sections of wing discs at defined angles. This methodology was critical to our analysis of signaling gradients in the wing pouch.",40,"The combination of immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM) is essential to high-resolution detection of molecular distribution in biological specimens. A frequent limitation is the need to image deep inside a tissue or in a specific plane, which may be inaccessible due to tissue size or shape. Recreating high-resolution 3D images is not possible because the pointspread function of light reduces the resolution in the Z-axis about 3-fold, compared to XY, and light scattering obscures signal deep in the tissue. However, the XY plane of interest can be chosen if embedded samples are precisely oriented and sectioned prior to imaging (Figure 1). Here we describe the preparation of frozen tissue sections of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, which allows us to obtain high-resolution images throughout the depth of this folded epithelium."

Although the trypanosomatids multiply predominantly by clonal generation, the presence of DNA exchange in some of them has been puzzling researchers over the years, mainly because it may represent a novel form that these organisms use to gain variability. Analysis of DNA Exchange using Thymidine Analogs (ADExTA) is a method that allows the in vitro detection and measurement of rates of DNA exchange, particularly in trypanosomatid cells, in a rapid and simple manner by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The method can be used to detect DNA exchange within one trypanosomatid lineage or among different lineages by paired analysis. The principle of this assay is based on the incorporation of two distinguishable halogenated thymidine analogs called 5_^ -chloro- .2: - deoxyuridine (CldU) and 5^. -iodo- .2^. -deoxyuridine (IdU) during DNA replication. After mixing the two cell cultures that had been previously incorporated with CldU and IdU separately, the presence of these unusual deoxynucleosides in the genome can be detected by specific antibodies. For this, a DNA denaturation step is required to expose the sites of thymidine analogs incorporated. Subsequently, a secondary  reaction  using  fluorochrome-labeled  antibodies  will  generate  distinct  signals  under fluorescence analysis. By using this method, DNA exchange verification (i.e., the presence of both CldU and IdU in the same cell) is possible using a standard fluorescence microscope. It typically takes 2-3 days from the thymidine analogs incorporation to results. Of note, ADExTA is relatively cheap and does not require transfections or harsh genetic manipulation. These features represent an advantage when compared to other time-consuming protocols that demand DNA manipulation to introduce distinct drugresistance markers in different cells for posterior selection."

The Cas9 nuclease is directed to the DNA by a programmable single guide (sg)RNA, and introduces a site-specific double-stranded break (DSB). In mammalian cells, DSBs are either repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), generating small insertion/deletion (indel) mutations, or by homology-directed repair (HDR). If ectopic donor templates are provided, the latter mechanism allows editing with single-nucleotide precision. The preference of mammalian cells to repair DSBs by NHEJ rather than HDR, however, limits the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 for applications where precise editing is needed. To enhance the efficiency of DSB repair by HDR from donor templates, we recently engineered a CRISPR-Cas9 system where the template DNA is bound to the Cas9 enzyme. In short, single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with O6-benzylguanine (BG), and covalently linked to a Cas9-SNAP-tag fusion protein to form a ribonucleoprotein-DNA (RNPD) complex consisting of the Cas9 nuclease, the sgRNA, and the repair template. Here, we provide a detailed protocol how to generate O6-benzylguanine (BG)-linked DNA repair templates, produce recombinant Cas9-SNAP-tag fusion proteins, in vitro transcribe single guide RNAs, and transfect RNPDs into various mammalian cells."

The development and early testing of the method are described in Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2017. Here, we present a protocol for establishment and evaluation of the fly stocks that can be used for functional annotation of genes in a tissue-specific manner throughout the development of Drosophila. The method, called “Flip-flop”, is built upon the versatile Minos mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) platform (Venken et al., 2011; Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015a and 2015b) and involves genomic integration of the “Flip-flop cassette” that contains two modules: a protein-trap (PT) module and a genetrap (GT) module (Figure 1A). The PT-module tags the gene of interest with EGFP at the endogenous locus, whereas the GT module facilitates generation of truncation mutants that express mCherry under the control of the natural regulatory elements of the gene. Once the cassette is inserted in a coding intron in the PT orientation, it can be reversed into the opposite GT-orientation in vivo with the help of FLP. The inversion marks the mutant cells, as they express mCherry under the endogenous gene’s control, and helps distinguish them from the rest of the tissue expressing EGFP tagged protein (Figure 1B). There are several advantages of Flip-flop over the traditional method MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker; Lee and Luo, 1999): First, the control cells and the mutant cells are marked with EGFP and mCherry respectively, and the reporters are expressed at the endogenous level. This removes the need for introducing additional fluorescent reporters and GAL4 drivers required in",36,"Mosaic analysis in Drosophila, an important tool to assess cellular phenotypes of mutants in an otherwise heterozygous background, relies on mitosis. Hence, it cannot be used to inactivate gene function in mitotically inactive, terminally differentiated cells such as neurons. To address this issue, we developed “Flip-flop”, a novel, Flippase-dependent in vivo cassette-inversion method that functions independent of mitosis, and therefore can be used for gene inactivation in both mitotic as well as postmitotic cells. This method allows tagging protein-coding genes with EGFP and generates mutant cells that are marked with mCherry upon cassette inversion. Here, we describe protocols for generation and validation of fly lines that can be used for conditional gene inactivation in mitotic as well as post-mitotic cells. We provide typical examples of Flip-flop mediated mosaic analysis in SNF4Aγ and Trim9. Use of Flip-flop mediated functional analysis will permit a detailed investigation of the role of genes previously recalcitrant to mosaic analysis."

Since these diseases are mainly biofilm-associated, a better understanding of how E. faecalis forms biofilms within the host can enable us to develop novel antibacterial therapies (Dunny et al., 2014).",93,"Biofilm formation is a well-known bacterial strategy that protects cells from hostile environments. During infection, bacteria found in a biofilm community are less sensitive to antibiotics and to the immune response, often allowing them to colonize and persist in the host niche. Not surprisingly, biofilm formation on medical devices, such as urinary catheters, is a major problem in hospital settings. To be able to eliminate such biofilms, it is important to understand the key bacterial factors that contribute to their formation. A common practice in the lab setting is to study biofilms grown in laboratory media. However, these media do not fully reflect the host environment conditions, potentially masking relevant biological determinants. This is the case during urinary catheterization, where a key element for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization and biofilm formation is the release of fibrinogen (Fg) into the bladder and its deposition on the urinary catheter. To recapitulate bladder conditions during catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), we have developed a fibrinogen-coated catheter and 96-well plate biofilm assay in urine. Notably, enterococcal biofilm factors identified in these in vitro assays proved to be important for biofilm formation in vivo in a mouse model of CAUTI. Thus, the method described herein can be used to uncover biofilm-promoting factors that are uniquely relevant in the host environment, and that can be exploited to develop new antibacterial therapies."

There is an ongoing effort to identify therapeutic approaches that will eliminate or reduce the size of this reservoir. However, clinical investigators lack an assay to determine whether or not a decrease in the latent reservoir has been achieved. Therefore, it is critical to develop assays that can reproducibly quantify the reservoir size and changes therein, in participant’s blood during a therapeutic trial. Quantification of the latent HIV viral reservoir requires a highly sensitive, cost-effective assay capable of measuring the low frequency of r C D4^+ T cells carrying functional provirus. Preferably, such an assay should be such that it can be adopted for high throughput and could be adopted under conditions for use in large-scale clinical trials. While PCR-based assays are commonly used to quantify pro-viral DNA or intracellular RNA transcript, they cannot distinguish between replication-competent and defective proviruses. We have recently published a study where a reporter cell-based assay (termed TZA or TZM-bl based quantitative assay) was used to quantify inducible replication-competent latent HIV-1 in blood. This assay is more sensitive, cost-efficient, and faster than available technology, including the quantitative viral outgrowth assay or the Q-VOA. Using this assay, we show that the size of the inducible latent HIV-1 reservoir in virally suppressed participants on ART is approximately 70-fold larger than previous estimates.

Due to the complexity of RTKs having biochemically different domains including a transmembrane domain, an intact crystal structure of any of these proteins remain elusive as it is difficult to produce milligram amounts of intact functional RTKs for crystallography studies. A heavily studied RTK is fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), which plays a key role in fibroblast growth regulation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. Previous studies have focused on expressing FGFR2’s extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains individually. For this protocol, we have focused on the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the FGFR2 protein. The function of the expressed protein is validated by demonstrating its ability to bind heparin and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). The primary contribution of our protocol is expressing two RTK domains together, including the transmembrane domain, in milligram quantities. Being able to express RTKs to define its crystal structures would enable pharmacologists to design cancer drugs that selectively target active conformations."

Hippocampal slices from these mutant mice have become one of the most widely used experimental paradigms for studying both normal synaptic plasticity and its dysfunction in animal models of human psychiatric and neurological disorders.",126,"The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity has been hindered by both the compensation that can occur after chronic loss of the core plasticity molecules and by ex vivo conditions that may not reproduce in vivo plasticity. Here we describe a novel method to rapidly suppress gene expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) applied to rodent brain slices in an “Oslo-type” interface chamber. The method has three advantageous features: 1) rapid blockade of new synthesis of the targeted proteins that avoids genetic compensation, 2) efficient oxygenation of the brain slice, which is critical for reproducing in vivo conditions of long-term synaptic plasticity, and 3) a recirculation system that uses only small volumes of bath solution (<5m l) , reducing the amount of reagents required for long-term experiments lasting many hours. The method employs a custom-made recirculation system involving piezoelectric micropumps and was first used for the acute translational blockade of protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) synthesis during long-term potentiation (LTP) by Tsokas et al., 2016. In that study, applying antisense-ODN rapidly prevents the synthesis of PKMζ and blocks late-LTP without inducing the compensation by other protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that occurs in PKCζ/PKMζ knockout mice. In addition, we show that in a low-oxygenation submersion-type chamber, applications of the atypical PKC inhibitor, zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), can result in unstable baseline synaptic transmission, but in the high-oxygenation, “Oslo-type” interface electrophysiology chamber, the drug reverses late-LTP without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. This comparison reveals that the interface chamber, but not the submersion chamber, reproduces the effects of ZIP in vivo. Therefore, the protocol combines the ability to acutely block new synthesis of specific proteins for the study of long-term synaptic plasticity, while maintaining properties of synaptic transmission that reproduce in vivo conditions relevant for long-term memory."

Flaviviruses have a single ORF genome encoding a long polypeptide, which is post-translationally cleaved into three structural (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) proteins by the host signal peptidase and NS2B-NS3 viral protease (Chambers et al., 1990).",56,"Cells infected with flavivirus release various forms of infectious and non-infectious particles as products and by-products.

The protocols have been introduced to improve the quality and yield of extractions, but these methods either increase the cost or involve multiple steps. Herein, we describe a detailed protocol for mouse AT protein extractions based on our daily laboratory practice. This protocol requires only very common reagents and instruments, and can be completed in 90-120 min and provides good recovery of total protein content.

Aminoacyl-tRNAs (charged) bring amino acids to the ribosome for peptide elongation, and then the uncharged tRNAs are released. The charging state of tRNA is largely determined by the available resource (i.e., amino acids) and their consumption by the ribosome. To analyze the charging state of cellular tRNA, methods have been developed using acid-urea gels to separate the total RNA and to detect the tRNA of interest by Northern blot (Janssen et al., 2012; Bullwinkle and Ibba, 2016). Recently, we explored the relationship between tRNA charging states and survival of starving bacteria (Yin et al., 2019).

The bioengineering of plants to enhance oil production can alter lipid metabolism in unexpected ways which may not be apparent by static quantification of lipids, but changes to lipid metabolic flux can be traced with isotopic labeling commonly with displaystyle^14 acetate. Because lipid classes such as MGDG are composed of many different molecular species, full analysis of metabolically labeled lipids requires separation and quantification of the individually labeled molecular species which is traditionally performed by thin layer chromatography.

However, the challenge remains, particularly in the conformational transition and dynamics study area where a much higher quantity of the receptors and G proteins is required even in comparison to X-ray and cryo-EM (5 mg/ml, 3 μl/sample) when NMR spectroscopy (5~m g/m l,~250~ul) /sample) is applied.

Commensal gut microbiota process undigested food, provide energy, nutrients and vitamins, activate the immune system, and prevent pathogens from infecting the intestinal mucosal tissue (Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Pickard et al., 2017). Despite these beneficial roles, gut commensal microorganisms may act as opportunistic pathogens when they get the opportunity to colonize intestinal epithelial barrier and invade into the mucosal tissue. However, a gel like mucus layer above the apical surface of the epithelial cells throughout the intestinal tract ensures physical separation of commensal microbes from the intestinal mucosal tissue and helps maintain intestinal homeostasis (Pullan et al., 1994; Linden et al., 2008; Atuma et al., 2011; Johansson et al., 2011; Juge, 2012). In the large intestine, mucus barrier is very thick, about 700 nm, and can be divided into two distinct layers – a thick outer layer and a thin inner layer (Johansson et al., 2008 and 2011). While the outer layer is nutrient rich, easy to be dislodged, and often colonized with anaerobic bacteria, the inner layer is firmly attached to the epithelial layer and is mostly sterile (Johansson et al., 2008 and 2011).",27,"The mucus layer in the gastrointestinal tract covers the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells, protecting the mucosal tissue from enteric pathogen and commensal microorganisms. The mucus is primarily composed of glycosylated protein called mucins, which are produced by goblet cells, a type of columnar epithelial cells in the intestinal tract. Defective mucin barrier facilitates infection caused by enteric pathogen and triggers inflammation due to invasion of commensal or opportunistic pathogens into the intestinal epithelial mucosa. Several bacterial species in the gut produce enzymes that are capable of degradation of the mucus. Defective mucin production or increased abundance of mucolytic bacteria are clinically linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of mucolytic enzymes in the feces, therefore, can be implicated in clinical and experimental research on intestinal disorders. Here, we describe a step-by-step procedure for the measurement of the mucolytic enzyme activity in fecal samples."

Canonical nucleosome core particles consist of two copies each of the four histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 assembled into a histone octamer that is tightly wrapped by 147 bp of DNA (Luger et al., 1997; Richmond and Davey, 2003). Accessibility to the genetic code for readout and processing is facilitated by (partial) unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA and can be achieved either by active processes involving, e.g., RNA polymerase or nucleosome chaperones that exert forces and torques on the nucleosomes (Sirinakis et al., 2011; Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013; Narlikar et al., 2013; Ordu et al., 2016), or spontaneously by thermal fluctuations (Li and Widom, 2004). Using singlemolecule micromanipulation techniques such as optical tweezers, the energetics of force-induced nucleosome unwrapping has been probed at high resolution (Mihardja et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2009; Schlingman et al., 2014; Ngo et al., 2015; Kaczmarczyk et al., 2020).

Recently, we have shown that a combination of large scale AFM imaging and automated image analysis of nucleosomes can overcome these previous limitations of AFM nucleoprotein studies. Using our high-throughput imaging and analysis pipeline, we have resolved nucleosome wrapping intermediates with five base pair resolution and revealed how distinct nucleosome variants and environmental conditions affect the unwrapping pathways of nucleosomal DNA.

This promoter system has a fast rate of repression but takes 14-20~h~ to induce mRNA expression (Maundrell, 1990). To transcend the limits of existing systems, I had designed the pTIN-system (Garg, 2020). Here, the n m t1^+ promoter directs synthesis of the nc-tgp1 lncRNA, which is 5' -adjacent to the tgp  I^+ promoter. The tgp I^+ promoter in turn guides the synthesis of the gene of interest (GOI). In thiamine-starved conditions, lncRNA transcription interferes with the tgp calI^+ promoter and represses expression of the GOI. Inclusion of thiamine shuts off lncRNA synthesis and allows GOI expression. The pTIN-overexpression system has (i) rapid induction with maximal mRNA expression within an hour after the addition of thiamine, (ii) 60-fold dynamic range, and (iii) tunable expression by varying thiamine concentration in the medium (Garg, 2020). This protocol describes the utilization of the pTIN-system.",48,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent genetically tractable model organism used in the study of conserved eukaryotic cellular biology. One genetic tool in the assessment of gene function is the in vivo overexpression of proteins. Existing overexpression tools have limitations of induction kinetics, dynamic range, and/or system-wide changes due to the induction conditions or inducer. Here, I describe the methodology for the use of a plasmid-based long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-regulated overexpression system that is induced by the addition of thiamine. This system, termed the pTIN-system (thiamine inducible), utilizes the fast repression kinetics of the thiamineregulated nmt1+ promoter integrated with the lncRNA regulated tgp  I^+ promoter. The advantages of the pTIN-system are rapid induction kinetics of gene expression, broad dynamic range, and tunable expression."

This assay uses a hyperactive Tn5 transposase, to simultaneously cut open chromatin and insert adapter sequences. After sequencing, the reads generated through this technique are generally indicative of transcriptional regulatory elements that are located in accessible chromatin. This method was originally developed by Buenrostro et al. (2013), and since then it has been improved by the same authors several times, until their last update called OMNI ATAC-seq (Corces et al., 2017). Here, we describe an ATAC-seq protocol based on the OMNI-ATAC method, with a special focus on the initial steps of thawing cryopreserved cells, and the final steps of library purification using magnetic beads. This protocol can be of interest for laboratories working in a fast-paced environment."

We recently described a dramatic increase in the uptake of intravenously injected MVs by monocytes marginated within the pulmonary vasculature, in a mouse model of low-dose lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of enhanced MV uptake by monocytes, we developed an in vitro model using in vivo derived monocytes. Although mouse blood is a convenient source, monocyte numbers are too low for in vitro experimentation. In contrast, differentiated bone marrow monocytes are abundant, but they are rapidly mobilized during systemic inflammation, and thus no longer available. Instead, we developed a protocol using marginated monocytes from the pulmonary vasculature as an anatomically relevant and abundant source. Mice are sacrificed by terminal anesthesia, the lungs inflated and perfused via the pulmonary artery. Perfusate cell populations are evaluated by flow cytometry, combined with in vitro generated fluorescently labelled MVs, and incubated in suspension for up to one hour. Washed cells are analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify MV uptake and confocal microscopy to localize MVs within cells (O'Dea et al., 2020). Using this perfusion-based method, substantial numbers of marginated pulmonary vascular monocytes are recovered, allowing multiple in vitro tests to be performed from a single mouse donor. As MV uptake profiles were comparable to those observed in vivo, this method is suitable for physiologically relevant high throughput mechanistic studies on mouse monocytes under in vitro conditions."
