The \u0394mdtM and \u0394acrB deletion mutants were used as the background strains for determining IC50 values of cells expressing wild-type mdtM (pMdtM) or, as a control, dysfunctional MdtM D22A (pD22A) mutant from pBAD/Myc-His A vector (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a). Ethidium bromide efflux assays used the outer membrane permeability mutant UTL2 strain of E. coli (Beja and Bibi, 1996). For production of inverted vesicles used in transport assays, E. coli TO114 complemented with pMdtM or pD22A was used. The TO114 strain is deficient in the Na+/H+ antiporters NhaA and NhaB, and the K+/H+ antiporter ChaA. This strain was chosen specifically to abrogate any potential interference from NhaA and NhaB Na+/H+ antiport activity (Holdsworth and Law, 2013). Overproduction of wild-type and mutant MdtM for purification and subsequent use in substrate-binding assays was performed in E. coli LMG194 (KS272 \u0394ara714 leu::Tn10) transformed with the appropriate plasmid (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a).Construction of MdtM mutantsMdtM W309F and W309A mutants were produced using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with pMdtM as the template, and the following 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 PCR primers (W309F forward: tcgccgcacgtcttcctgtggtcggtgc; W309F reverse: gcaccgaccacaggaagacgtgcggcga; W309A forward: gtcgccgcacgtcgcgctgtggtcggtg; W309A reverse: caccgaccacagcgcgacgtgcggcgac). The fidelity of each mutant construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis.Determination of MIC of bile saltsMICs of the sodium salts of cholate and deoxycholate were determined using serial twofold dilutions of each bile salt from a 128 mg ml\u22121 stock on solid Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar plates, each inoculated with 104 colony-forming units (cfu) of the strain to be tested. The plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C prior to ocular inspection for colony growth.Quantitative PCR analysis of mdtM transcript levelsTo test for the effects of bile salt on transcript levels of MdtM, total RNA was extracted from cell pellets prepared from duplicate 1 ml samples of mid-log phase, wild-type E. coli BW25113 with or without 20 mM sodium cholate, and taken at t = 0 min, t = 15 min and t = 30 min. RNA (1 \u03bcg) was treated with DNase (Turbo DNA Free, Life Technologies) before reverse-transcription to cDNA. Transcriptional changes in mdtM between cholate-treated and untreated samples were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR analysis of these cDNAs, with changes expressed relative to a reference transcript (rrsB, 16S rRNA). PCR primers were designed against GenBank-derived rrsB and mdtM sequences (rrsB forward: agagcaagcggacctcataa; rrsB reverse: aacgtattcaccgtggcatt; mdtM forward: gcctgggatcattaatgtgg; mdtM reverse: agccactgtaacgccatacc). Following collection of Ct and efficiency values using RotorGene software, transcriptional changes in mdtM were determined using the Augmented \u0394\u0394Ct method (Pfaffl, 2001).Determination of IC50 of cholate and deoxycholateTo test the contribution of MdtM to intrinsic resistance against bile salts, growth of E. coli cells was measured in LB liquid medium that contained varying concentrations of the sodium salts of cholate or deoxycholate at pH values of 7.2 and 6.0. The pH of the medium was buffered by 70 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino] propane (BTP) and pH was adjusted by HCl. Assays were performed based on a previously described method (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b).Whole-cell ethidium bromide transport assaysThe effect of addition of 3.0 mM sodium cholate and 3.0 mM sodium deoxycholate on ethidium bromide (EtBr) efflux by E. coli outer membrane permeability mutant UTL2 cells enriched with MdtM was determined using a method described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2013) except that assays were performed at pH 6.0 to abrogate interference by MdtM-catalysed Na+(K+)/H+ antiport that occurs at alkaline pH. To test that bile salt had not compromised cell membrane integrity, UTL2 cells used to investigate the inhibitory effects of 3.0 mM sodium cholate on the EtBr efflux activity of MdtM were removed from the cuvette, washed twice in assay buffer to remove CCCP, then re-energized by addition of glucose.Measurement of proton-driven antiportAssays of bile salt/H+ antiport were conducted by measuring the fluorescence quenching/dequenching of the pH-sensitive indicator acridine orange upon addition of either 2.5 mM cholate or 2.0 mM deoxycholate to energized inverted membrane vesicles generated from antiporter-deficient E. coli TO114 cells that overproduced recombinant wild-type MdtM. Inverted vesicles of TO114 cells that overproduced dysfunctional MdtM from pD22A were used as controls. Transport measurements were performed as described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b) at pH values of 7.2 and 6.0. Control experiments to ensure any observed fluorescence dequench was not a result of MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ antiport were performed by addition of 2.5 mM sodium gluconate instead of bile salt. All experiments were performed in triplicate on at least two separate preparations of inverted vesicles.Measurement of the electrogenicity of bile salt/H+ antiportThe \u0394\u03c8-sensitive fluorophore Oxonol V [bis-(3-phenyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol] (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) was used to determine if the MdtM-mediated antiport observed in the previous experiments was electrogenic. Inverted vesicles were produced from TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM or pD22A as described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2013), except that the vesicle resuspension buffer was made Cl\u2212-free by substitution of the 140 mM choline chloride component with 280 mM sorbitol and by using H2SO4 rather than HCl to adjust buffer pH. Vesicles (0.5 mg ml\u22121 membrane protein) were added to assay buffer (10 mM BTP, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 \u03bcM Oxonol V) that had its pH adjusted to 7.2 or 6.0. Electrogenic antiport activity was estimated on the basis of its ability to dissipate the established \u0394\u03c8 (recorded as a dequenching of the fluorescence signal) in response to addition of 2.5 mM sodium cholate or 2.0 mM sodium deoxycholate to vesicles at the times indicated. As a control experiment, to ensure that there was no interference from MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ antiport, 2.5 mM sodium gluconate was substituted for bile salt. As a further control, 1 \u03bcM of the ionophore nigericin (which at low concentrations selectively consumes \u0394pH in the presence of K+ via electroneutral K+/H+ exchange) was added to vesicles of TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM. These vesicles were incubated in assay buffer that contained 50 mM K+ gluconate, and valinomycin (5 \u03bcM) was added to selectively abolish \u0394\u03c8.Purification of MdtMWild-type and mutant protein for use in substrate binding assays and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies was homologously overexpressed in E. coli LMG194 cells and purified following the protocol described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a). Purified protein was placed on ice and used immediately for substrate binding studies. Concentrated MdtM solution for use in CD studies was diluted down with an imidazole- and NaCl-free buffer to minimize interference from those compounds with the spectroscopic measurements.Substrate binding assaysSubstrate-binding affinity of purified, wild-type MdtM for the sodium salts of cholate and deoxycholate was determined at pH 7.2 and pH 6.0 using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching of protein in detergent solution based on the protocol described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b). Control assays that investigated binding of cholate to the W309F and W309A MdtM mutants were performed at pH 7.2.Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopyFar UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco UK). MdtM samples were analysed at pH 6 and pH 7.2 using a 5.3 \u03bcM protein solution in a 0.02 cm pathlength quartz cuvette. A suitable buffer baseline was collected and subtracted from each protein spectrum. Corrected data were expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity (degrees cm\u22122 dmol\u22121). The online CD secondary structure analysis server Dichroweb (Whitmore and Wallace, 2004) and the CONTIN procedure Reference set 4 (Provencher and Glockner, 1981) was used to analyse the CD data.Western blot analysis of recombinant MdtMEstimation of expression levels of recombinant wild-type and D22A mutant MdtM in transformed BW25113 \u0394mdtM and BW25113 \u0394acrB cells grown at pH 7.2 and pH 6.0 was performed by Western blot analysis following a protocol described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2013)."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Preparation of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles for Characterisation of Periplasmic Proteins", "keywords": " Outer membrane vesicles, Gram-negative bacteria, Periplasm, NMR spectroscopy, In-situ protein studies", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3853", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Gene Cloning and Transformation"}, "1.1": "Clone the complete gene coding for the protein of interest into a suitable plasmid backbone of the pET expression system.", "1.2": "Transform the final plasmid into an OMV-overproducing strain such as BL21(DE3)\u2206ompA.", "1.3": "Carry out these steps following standard molecular biology techniques.", "2": {"title": "Preparation of Growth Media and Buffers"}, "2.1": "Prepare 5ml LB medium, 1L M9 medium, 25ml DPBSS, and 0.2ml NMR sample buffer.", "2.2": "Supplement growth media with appropriate antibiotics for selection of the strain/plasmid used for expression.", "2.3": "Prepare stock solutions of antibiotics and IPTG.", "3": {"title": "Bacterial Growth"}, "3.1": "Inoculate 5ml LB medium with a single colony and grow shaking at 37\u00b0C for 10h.", "3.2": {"title": "Grow in M9 Medium"}, "3.2.1": "Inoculate 100ml M9 in a 500ml baffled culture flask using 1ml of the culture grown in LB medium.", "3.2.2": "Grow shaking at 37\u00b0C overnight.", "3.2.3": "Add the entire preculture to 900ml M9 in a 5,000ml baffled culture flask and grow shaking at 37\u00b0C.", "3.3": {"title": "Monitor and Induce Protein Expression"}, "3.3.1": "Check the optical density OD600 every 30min.", "3.3.2": "Add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2mM to induce protein expression when the optical density reaches OD600 0.4.", "3.3.3": "Continue to monitor the optical density OD600 every 30min.", "3.4": {"title": "Harvest and Filter Cells"}, "3.4.1": "Remove the cells by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 10min at 10\u00b0C when bacterial growth ceases.", "3.4.2": "Filter the supernatant with 0.45um vacuum filtration units.", "4": {"title": "OMV Preparation"}, "4.1": {"title": "Collect OMVs by Centrifugation"}, "4.1.1": "Collect OMVs from the filtered supernatant by centrifugation at 38,400\u00d7g for 2h at 10\u00b0C.", "4.1.2": "Immediately discard the supernatant.", "4.2": {"title": "Resuspend and Filter OMV Pellets"}, "4.2.1": "Resuspend OMV pellets in a total volume of 25ml DPBSS by pipetting.", "4.2.2": "Filter the OMV suspension with a 0.45um syringe filter.", "4.3": {"title": "Collect and Resuspend OMVs"}, "4.3.1": "Collect OMVs by centrifugation using a single centrifuge tube at 74,500\u00d7g for 45min at 10\u00b0C.", "4.3.2": "Resuspend the OMV pellet in 200ul NMR sample buffer by gentle vortexing.", "5": {"title": "OMV Analysis"}, "5.1": {"title": "Dilute OMV Suspension and Record UV-Vis Spectrum"}, "5.1.1": "Dilute 2ul of the final OMV suspension with 18ul DPBSS.", "5.1.2": "Record a UV-Vis spectrum of the dilute OMV suspension using a microvolume spectrophotometer.", "5.2": {"title": "Correct Spectrum and Estimate Protein Concentration"}, "5.2.1": "Correct the exported spectrum for the light-scattering contribution of the OMVs.", "5.2.2": "Estimate the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280nm.", "5.3": {"title": "Prepare and Analyze Samples by SDS Page"}, "5.3.1": "Prepare two samples for SDS page using denaturing Laemmli Sample Buffer.", "5.3.2": "Heat-denature one of the samples at 98\u00b0C for 15min.", "5.3.3": "Analyze samples by SDS page."}, "text_flat": "Preparation of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles for Characterisation of Periplasmic Proteins\n\n1. 0.22um vacuum filtration unit (such as Steritop Quick Release, EMD Millipore, catalog number: S2GPT05RE)\n2. 0.45~A m vacuum  filtration  unit  (such  as  Stericup-HV,  EMD  Millipore,  catalog  number: SCHVU11RE)\n3. 50ml syringe (such as Fisherbrand Sterile Syringes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: 15899152)\n4. 0.45um syringe filter (such as Millex-HP, EMD Millipore, catalog number: SLHP033R)\n5.

Gene cloning and transformationThe complete gene coding for the protein of interest including its preceding periplasmic export signal should be cloned into a suitable plasmid backbone of the pET expression system (such as pET21a). Thereby, additional features such as affinity tags are not necessary and should be omitted. The final plasmid should be transformed into an OMV-overproducing strain such as BL21(DE3)\u2206ompA (Fantappi\u00e8 et al., 2014). These steps can be carried out following standard molecular biology techniques. The description of detailed cloning and transformation procedures lies outside the scope of this protocol.B.  Preparation of growth media and buffersPer sample requirements are: 5ml LB medium, 1 L M9 medium, ^25ml DPBSS, 0.2 ml NMR sample buffer (see Recipes for formulations). Supplement growth media with appropriate antibiotics for selection of the strain/plasmid used for expression. When using the pET expression system, use Ampicillin to a final concentration of 100u9mGamma^-1 or Kanamycin to a final concentration of 50umI^-1 . Stock solutions of antibiotics (Ampicillin: 100 m g mV^1 ; Kanamycin: 50 m g m^1-1 ) and IPTG (1 M) can be prepared in H_2O/D_2O , corresponding to the solvent used for growth media.C.  Bacterial growth1.  Inoculate 5m lL B medium with a single colony.2.  Grow shaking at 37~^\u00b0C for 10h .3.  Inoculate 100 ml M9 in a 500~ml baffled culture flask using 1 ml of the culture grown in LBmedium.4.  Grow shaking at 37~^\u00b0C overnight ( 80 rpm, 25m m orbit).5.  Add the entire preculture to 900m lM9 in a 5,000 ml baffled culture flask.6.  Grow shaking at 37~^\u00b0C 80 rpm, 25~m m orbit).7.  Check the optical density OD600 every 30m i n .8.  When the optical density reaches OD600 0.4 add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2 m M to induce protein expression.9.  Continue to monitor the optical density OD600 every 30 min.10. When bacterial growth ceases (after 3~h~ in H_2O/S~h~ in D_2O based media, see Figure 1) remove the cells by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 10~^\u00b0C .11. Filter the supernatant with 0.45um vacuum filtration units. The filtered supernatant can be stored at 4^\u00b0C for up to ^24h .()Figure 1. Media-dependent growth behavior. Exemplary growth curves in H_2O based (dark blue) and D_2O based (light blue) M9 minimal media. Triangles mark the time of induction, squares mark the time of harvest.# D.  OMV Preparation1.  Collect OMVs from the filtered supernatant by centrifugation at 38,400xg for ^2h at 10~^\u00b0C . After centrifugation, centrifuge bottles should contain a small but clearly visible whitish, slightly cloudy pellet (Figure 2A).2.  Immediately discard the supernatant (OMV pellets will begin to suspend shortly).3.  Resuspend OMV pellets in a total volume of ^25ml DPBSS by pipetting.4.  Filter the OMV suspension with a 0.45um syringe filter.5.  Collect OMVs by centrifugation using a single centrifuge tube at 74,500\u00d7 g for 45 min at 10~^\u00b0C (Figure 2B).6.  Immediately discard the supernatant.7.  Resuspend the OMV pellet in 200ul NMR sample buffer by gentle vortexing.8.  Save 2~ul of the OMV suspension for subsequent analysis and transfer the remaining suspension to a microscale NMR tube (Figure 2C). OMV suspensions are in our hands stable at 4^\u00b0C for up to 2 weeks.()Figure 2. Preparation of OMVs. OMV pellets after the first (A) and second centrifugation (B), and resuspended in NMR buffer in a 5mm Shigemi NMR tube (C).# E.  OMV Analysis1.  Dilute 2ul of the final OMV suspension with 18ul DPBSS.2.  Record  a  UV-Vis  spectrum  of  the  dilute  OMV  suspension  using  a  microvolume spectrophotometer (range: 220-360 nm) and export the spectrum data for further analysis.3.  Correct the exported spectrum for the light-scattering contribution of the OMVs and estimate the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280n m (see Data analysis and Figure 3A). OMV preparations should contain >5~mg/ml total protein to yield NMR spectra of good quality.4.  Prepare two samples for SDS page using denaturing Laemmli Sample Buffer, containing 6u total protein each.5.  Heat-denature one of the samples at 98~^\u00b0C for 15 min, keep the second sample at room temperature.6.  Analyze samples by SDS page. Samples of protein-enriched OMVs should result in two prominent bands. One band corresponding to the major porins OmpF/OmpC present in the OMV membrane runs at 37k D a in the heat-denatured sample and results in a contorted, ladderlike pattern between 60 and 70 k D a in the non-heated sample (Figure 3B). A second band, usually not subject to heat-modifiability, should be present at the weight of the overexpressed protein of choice, indicating successful enrichment in the OMVs (Figure 3B).()Figure 3.

Cell division was assessed by vital labeling with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (C34554, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies Europe, Stockholm, Sweden)63 and DNA content was examined by propidium iodide staining.ImmunoblottingCell lysates were prepared in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, fractionated in precast 4\u201312% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The blots were probed with antibodies to TRF1 (1:1000 sc.56807, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), TRF2 (1:1000, IMG124A, IMGENEX, San Diego, CA, USA), POT1 (1:1000 NB500-176, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), TPP1 (1:500 ab39042, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), TIN2 (1:250 IMG-282, IMGENEX), RAP-1 (1:1000 NB100-292, Novus Biologicals), ATRX (1:1000 H-300, Sc-15408, Santa Cruz), DAXX (1:1000 D7810, Sigma-Aldrich) and \u03b2-actin (1:20 000 A5441, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA), developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK) and analyzed using the Fuji LAS 1000 system (FujiFilm Medical Systems Inc., Stamford, CT, USA).Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridizationThe cells were treated with 30 ng/ml colcemide (KaryoMAX, Invitrogen Corp.) for 90 min to induce metaphase arrest, washed in hypotonic buffer containing 75 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), fixed in methanol acetic acid (3:1) and dropped onto cold glass slides. The slides were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Merck) for 5 min, treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C and dehydrated by consecutive 5-min incubations in 70%, 85% and 100% cold ethanol. After air drying, hybridization solution containing the Telomere PNA probe (Panagene, Cambridge Research Biomedicals, Cleveland, UK) was added, followed by heat denaturation for 3 min at 80 \u00b0C. Hybridization was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were then overlaid with washing solutions, dehydrated and mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA). Digital images were captured with a LEITZ LEITZBMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonic Norden AB, Kista, Sweden). The presence of telomere abnormalities, including telomere fusions and extra chromosomal telomere, were scored in digital images using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The fluorescence intensity of each telomere signal was scored using the Volocity Software (Improvision, University of Warwick Science Park, UK). The results are expressed as fluorescence intensity of telomeres in 25 randomly selected metaphase plates from three independent experiments.Detection of APBs and telomere-associated TRF2 by immunofluorescence-FISHThree \u00d7 104 cells in 0.1 ml phosphate-buffered saline were deposited on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation, fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (T9284, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. After blocking with 3% fetal calf serum for 30 min, the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse monoclonal antibody to PML (1:100, kind gift of Hugues de Th\u00e9, University of Paris, Paris, France), or overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rabbit polyclonal antibody to TRF2 (1:100, Sc-9143, Santa Cruz), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen Corp.) for 30 min. After washing and fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min and dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol, Q-FISH was performed as described above. The presence of APBs was scored in digital images captured using a LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss, Carl Zeiss AB, Stockholm, Sweden) based on colocalization of PML and telomere signals on a single focal plane using the ImagJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov). For quantification of telomere-associated TRF2, digital images were captured with an ImageXpress Micro device (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and analyzed with the MetaExpress Software (Molecular Devices). Two thousand telomere signals were identified in multiple images from each experimental condition and the intensity of red (telomere) and green (TRF2) fluorescence within each selected telomere area was quantified.Detection of telomere sister chromatid exchanges by chromosome orientation-FISHThe cells were grown in medium containing 10 \u03bcM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and BrdC (MP Biomedicals, IIIkirch, France) at 3:1 ratio for 16 h and chromosome slides were prepared as described. After treatment with 0.5 mg/ml RNAase A (Invitrogen Corp.) for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C, staining with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33258 in 2 \u00d7 SSC for 15 min at room temperature and cross-linking by exposure to 365-nm UV light (Stratalinker 1800, Agilent Technologies, St Clara, CA, USA) for 30 min, the slides were digested with 10 U/\u03bcl Exonuclease III (Fermentas, Leon-Rot, Germany) for 10 min at room temperature and sequentially incubated with TAMRA-TelG 5\u2032-(TTAGGG)3-3\u2032 and FITC-TelC 5\u2032-[CCCTAA]3-3\u2032 probes (Cambridge Research Biomedicals) at room temperature for 2 h followed by washing, dehydration and mounting with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield. Digital images were analyzed as described.Detection of telomerase activity by TRAPTelomerase activity was measured using the TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (S7700, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 200 \u03bcl of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) lysis buffer supplemented with 200 U/ml of RNAse inhibitor (N211B, Promega, Madison WI, USA). After clearing by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories AB, Solna, Sweden). The reactions were carried out with 0.1 \u03bcg of cell lysate in 25 \u03bcl of TRAP buffer, containing dNTP, primers and DNA polymerase (F120S, Hot Start DNA Polymerase, BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, UK). Cell lysates provided by the kit were used as positive control and lysates of the telomerase negative U2OS cell line were used to determine the background activity of the assays. Telomere extension was performed at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 28 PCR cycles including denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 s, annealing at 61 \u00b0C for 30 s and elongation for 1 min at 72 \u00b0C. As negative control, the lysates were heated at 85 \u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate the telomerase. The PCR products were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and electrophoresis was carried out at 300 V for 2 h, followed by staining with SYBR Gold (S11494, Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA), and visualization using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Digital images were analyzed using the Gene Imager software (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) and total product generated units were calculated as indicated by the kit.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.

Plant sweet basil seeds in square pots filled with Sunshine Mix 4 and allow it to grow for 3 weeks in a plant growth chamber at 25~^\u00b0C with a photoperiod of 12h .2. Plants used for transformation are at two-true leaf stage.3. The first two true leaves, with a length usually ranging from 1.5-2.0 cm , are used to excise explants for stable transformation.B. Agrobacterium preparationNote: Perform under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.1. Three days prior to transformation, streak Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 carrying the desired plasmid, which is stored at -80~^\u00b0C , on a LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics. We used the plasmids derived from pKSE401 vector (Xing et al., 2014) for targeted mutagenesis of sweet basil ObDMR1 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Navet and Tian, 2020). The LB agar plates in our experiments are supplemented with 15ug/ml rifampicin (for selection of A. tumefaciens EHA105) and 50 u/ml kanamycin (for selection of the plasmid). Incubate the plate at 28~^\u00b0C for two days. Note: This plate can be stored at q^\u00b0C and used within one week.2. The day before transformation, scoop bacteria from the above plate using the bottom of a sterile 1.5~ml micro-centrifuge tube and spread on a new LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics (containing kanamycin and rifampicin in our study). Incubate the plate overnight at 28~^\u00b0C .3. On the day of transformation, scrape a portion of bacterial cells with a sterile 1ml pipette tip and resuspend in 1 ml Agrobacterium Inoculation media (IN) by pipetting the solution up and down until a homogeneous suspension is observed. Transfer the suspension to a 15 m tube containing 5ml IN media, and mix well. Note: Cover this tube with aluminium foil to avoid light as IN media contains light-sensitive acetosyringone.4. Measure the O D_600 of the above bacterial suspension using a spectrophotometer with IN media as blank, and adjust the final OD600 to 0.6 , a concentration used for inoculating explants. Approximately ^20mI of Agrobacterium suspension is needed for 100-150 explants. Incubate the suspension in a sterile 50ml conical tube at room temperature (RT) on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm for ^2h in dark. Note: Loosen the lid of the 50 ml conical tube to allow aeration and then cover the tube with aluminium foil.C. Preparation of explantsNote: Perform Steps C2, C3 and C4 in sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.1. Prepare the explants while the incubation of Agrobacterium suspension is taking place. From three-week-old sweet basil plants pluck the first pair of true leaves, and surface sterilize the leaves for 5 min by immersing them in 12% (v/v) Clorox Regular Bleach Disinfectant solution in a 500~m~l~ media bottle. This step should be done gently to avoid leaf damage. For each transformation, we usually handle 100 leaves.2. Immediately after surface sterilization, wash the leaves in sterile MilliQ water for 3 min by gently inverting the bottle several times. Repeat this washing step three more times. A total of four washes are required to remove any trace of bleach sticking to the leaves.3. Transfer the leaves onto a sterile paper towel. Excise two round leaf discs from each leaf from regions close to leaf base along the midrib using a sterile #2 cork borer, as shown in Figure 1.()# Figure 1. Excision of two explants (leaf discs of 6.25mm diameter) from a surfacesterilized true sweet basil leaf4. After excising the explants from each leaf, immediately place them in a sterile Petri dish filled with sterile MilliQ water as shown in Figure 2. This keeps the leaf discs fresh until explants are extracted from all leaves.()# Figure 2. Explants (leaf-discs) floating in sterile MillQ waterD. Inoculation of explants with Agrobacterium and their co-cultivationNote: Perform under sterile conditions.1. After the completion of Agrobacterium incubation and explants preparation, immerse all the explants in the Agrobacterium suspension for 30~m i n (Approximately ^20 ml of Agrobacteriumsuspension is needed for 100-150 explants), as shown in Figure 3. Keep the tube away from light by covering it with aluminium foil. Gently invert the tube 3-4 times every 10 min to ensure that all explants get submerged in the suspension.()# Figure 3. Diagrammatic representation showing leaf discs immersed in Agrobacterium suspension2. Blot dry the leaf discs by gently pressing them between two layers of sterile paper towel to remove excess suspension.3. Co-cultivation: Transfer the Agrobacterium-inoculated explants using sterile forceps onto callus and shoot induction (SI) media plates supplemented with 200ulA S with abaxial side touching the media (20 explants per Petri dish) (Figure 4A). Seal the plates with MicroporeTM surgical tape and wrap with aluminium foil. Incubate the plates for three days in plant tissue culture room at 25~^\u00b0C under dark conditions.E. Regeneration of transgenic plants1. Transfer the Agrobacterium-infected explants to SI media plates supplemented with 200 u/m l timentin (to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105) and 30 u/m l kanamycin for induction and selection of transgenic calli. Seal the plates with MicroporeTM surgical tape tape, wrap with aluminium foil and incubate the plates at 25~^\u00b0C under dark conditions for 4-6 weeks with regular sub-culturing onto fresh media every two weeks.During this process, we observe several key regeneration stages, including: swelling-up of leaf discs in irregular fashion within 1 week (Figure 4B), callus formation in another 1-2 weeks (Figure 4C), followed by the sprouting of tiny shoots usually as pale/yellow-colored (since plates are incubated under dark conditions) (Figure 4D) and occasionally green-colored (Figure 4E). A regular check on plates every week is recommended to observe callus/shoot formation. Do not allow the calli/shoots to turn dark (brown/black) and sub-culture onto fresh media if and when required. While sub-culturing clean the calli/shoots by removing any dead/decaying (brown/black) tissues and then place on fresh media.Note: Shoots may emerge inside the media as well, so flip the side when performing fresh subculturing to allow proper aeration.()Figure 4. Regeneration stages on callus and shoot induction (SI) media. A. Co-cultivation of leaf explants with Agrobacteria on SI media containing acetosyringone. B. Swelling-up of leafdiscs after 1 week on SI media supplemented with timentin and kanamycin. C. Callus formation after 2 weeks. D. Pale/yellow-colored shoots emerging from growing calli. E. Green-colored shoots.2. Once the shoots develop on calli, cut individual shoots (length approximately 0.5 cm and above) with a sterile scalpel and transfer to plant culture containers containing root induction (RI) media supplemented with 200u/ml timentin and 30u/m l kanamycin (Figure 5A). Seal the containers with MicroporeTM surgical tape, cover with aluminium foil and incubate the containers for 1 week in dark at 25~^\u00b0C .Note: Do not overcrowd the container with young shoots; allow half-centimeter spacing while placing the shoots.3. After 1 week, remove the foil and incubate the containers under light with a 12-hour photoperiod at ^25~^\u00b0C for 4-8 weeks with regular sub-culturing every two weeks onto fresh RI media supplemented with timentin and kanamycin. During sub-culturing to fresh media, make sure to remove any dead or decaying tissue, and only transfer the well-differentiated green shoot stalks (Figure 5B). Transfer each well-differentiated shoot stalk separately into a tissue culture container to allow root establishment and full development of the transgenic plant (Figures 5C5D). It usually takes 2-3 weeks after providing light conditions for a shoot stalk to develop into a transgenic plant with robust roots. At this stage (Figures 5C-5D), leaf tissue can be excised from the plants growing in the container to test for transgene integration by PCR.Notes:a. Keep a close observation on containers and perform sub-culturing when required;b. Discard shoots that do not show signs of root formation within one month.()Figure 5. Shoot and root development on root induction (RI) media. A. Shoots with emerging stalks transferred from SI to RI media for further development. B. Developing shoots on RI media after 2 weeks under light. C-D. Plantlet with well-established shoot (C) and root (D) system.# F. Acclimatization1. Remove the transgenic plants with well-developed shoot & root system from media container and thoroughly wash the roots with sterile MilliQ water to remove residue media.2. Plant them in moistened soil mix (Figure 6A) and grow under 100% relative humidity for 3-4 days in a tray covered with a plastic dome in a growth chamber set at 25~^\u00b0C with a 12-hour photoperiod.3. Adapt the plants to ex vitro conditions by gradually reducing the humidity over the next 2-3 days through partial opening of the plastic dome, and finally removing the plastic dome. Once the plant attains a certain height 12.0-15.0cm ), repot the plants in larger pots and transfer them to a greenhouse at 25-30 ^\u00b0C under natural light to propagate seeds (Figure 6B).()Figure 6. Acclimatization of regenerated transgenic plant in soil (A) and continued growth of transgenic plants in greenhouse for seed production (B)# Notes1. Do not use older sweet basil leaves for transformation (as it decreases the efficiency).2. Use  freshly  prepared  acetosyringone  (AS)  solution  in  order  to  increase  efficiency  of transformation.3. Limit the exposure of solution/media containing AS to light as much as possible.4. Handle plucked leaves gently while surface sterilizing and washing since vigorous shaking may damage leaf.5. Cleaning of calli and young shoots by removing dark/decaying tissues should be performed during regular sub-culturing.6. Do not overcrowd tissue culture Petri dishes or containers with developing tissues as it may limit the nutrient supply for organ differentiation and growth.7. Check the tissue culture plates/containers regularly for fungal and bacterial contamination, especially at 2 days after sub-culturing to new media. Once contamination is found, rescue the non-contaminated tissues by removing the fungal/bacterial colony (if still very small) carefully, or transferring the clean tissues to new media right away.# Recipes1.

All muscle arm counts were performed in the background of the chromosomally integrated transgenic array trIs30I or trIs70II, both of which express membrane-anchored YFP from the him-4 promoter in select distal body wall muscles along with other markers of commissural motor axons [4]. See below for details on the trIs integrated transgenes. For transgenic strains, muscle arms were visualized either in the background of trIs30I or trIs70II, or directly from fluorescence associated with the expression of the transgenic array. To visualize YFP-tagged proteins, we used the Leica 513867 filter set; to visualize CFP-tagged proteins, we used the Leica 513866 filter set; to visualize RFPs, we used Leica's 513868 filter set. Muscle arms were counted as previously described [4]. AVMs and PVMs were visualized using the fluorescent reporter background muIs32II [22]. The direction of axon extension of 50 AVMs and PVMs from at least three separate populations of the same strain was counted from living animals on standard culture plates using an epifluorescent MZ16 dissection scope (Leica Inc.) with a 2\u00d7 objective. Distal tip cell migration defects were scored by observing for the presence of anterior and posterior ventral white patches (relative to the vulva) from at least three separate populations of 50 living animals of the same strain. Distal tip cell migration defects were visualized using an epifluorescent MZ16 dissection scope (Leica Inc.) with a 2\u00d7 objective. Redirected muscle arms were counted from 20 left and right sides of worms for each strain. All counts of muscle arms are from worms anaesthetized with 2\u201310 mM levamisole (Sigma) in M9 solution [23] and photographed as previously described [4]. During strain construction, genotypes like madd-4(ok2862) or slt-1(ok255), which cannot be followed using obvious behavioral phenotypes, were instead followed using PCR and/or sequence of 5 or more individual progeny from a single cloned animal.All statistical analyses were performed using a one-tailed, two-sample equal variance Student's t-test. We used a one-tailed test because for all analyses we hypothesized that the effect would be unidirectional. For example, when comparing muscle arm extension in mutants with wild type worms, we hypothesize that the mutant mean would be smaller than the wild type mean. Lastly, we chose a test that compared two independent samples of equal variance because all counts performed fall under normal distributions.A Forward Genetic Screen for Mutants that Suppress Muscle Arm Redirection towards CAN-Expressed MADD-4A forward genetic screen for mutants that suppress muscle arm redirection towards CAN-expressed MADD-4 was performed by incubating a mixed stage population of RP1912 madd-4(ok2854); trIs70II; trIs63X animals in 50 \u00b5M ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 4 hours. trIs63 drives expression from the ceh-23 promoter in the bisymmetrical pair of CAN neurons that extend axons along the lateral length of the worm. See below for details on the trIs integrated transgenes. Resulting F1s were synchronized as L1s [23] and grown on 6 cm plates (\u223c3000 per plate) for 3 days, and then transferred manually to each well of a 24-well plate. F2 progeny were screened 4\u20137 days later for mutants with defects in redirected muscle arm extensions using a Leica MZFLIII epiflourescence dissection microscope with a 2\u00d7 objective. A total of \u223c17,500 haploid genomes were screened clonally as described, and a further \u223c2,400 haploid genomes were screened non-clonally by batch screening of F2 progeny. 51 suppressor mutants were isolated from these screens.Molecular Biology and TransgenicsThe following chromosomally-integrated transgenic arrays were made using standard techniques [24], [25] and are available either from the C. elegans Genetic Centre or from us: trIs30[pPRRF138.2(him-4p::Mb::YFP)(10 ng/ul); pPRZL44(hmr-1 bp::DsRed2)(80 ng/ul); pPR2.1(unc-129nsp::DsRed2)(40 ng/ul)]I; trIs34[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(2 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]X; trIs41[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(125 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]II; trIs63[pPRGS630(ceh-23p::MADD-4B::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS629(ceh-23p::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs65[pPRGS655(ceh-23p::MADD-4B::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS629(ceh-23p::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]; trIs66[pPRGS628(unc-119p::MADD-4B::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs69[pPRKC404(him-4p::PAT-2::CFP)(100 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]; trIs70[pPRZL138.2(him-4p::Mb::YFP)(5 ng/ul); pPR16(unc-25p::CFP)(20 ng/ul); pKS(75 ng/ul)]II; trIs73[pPRKC638.2(him-4p::UNC-40::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(100 ng/ul)]; trIs77[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]; trIs78[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]IV; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)]. The constructs were built using standard protocols. Note that expression of MADD-4 and EVA-1 at relatively high concentrations can induce dominant muscle arm extension defects.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis500 \u00b5L of mixed stage packed worms were washed thrice with M9 solution and once with PBS, and re-suspended in 1 mL ice cold solubilization buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2.5 \u00b5g/ml Pepstatin-A, 10 mM NaF and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) per 10 ml of solution). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and lysed through three cycles of flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, partial thawing and sonnication for 5 seconds at 8 Watts. Next, the samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C with agitation for 30 minutes and then centrifuged (13000 rpm, 30 min, 4\u00b0C). A BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure the protein concentration in the supernatant. 6 mg/ml of protein lysate was incubated with either 30 \u00b5l of packed Antiflag M2 agarose coupled antibody (Sigma) or 30 \u00b5l of packed Protein A/G agarose beads (SantaCruz) along with 2\u20134 \u00b5g of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (GenScript) for 3 hrs with agitation at 4\u00b0C. The agarose beads were centrifuged and washed 5 times with 1 ml of cold solubilization buffer. Samples were resuspended in 2\u00d7 Laemlli buffer and analyzed by western blot. The FLAG immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Genscript), and the GFP immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (SantaCruz).Normalization of luciferase signal to protein level expression was performed by first subtracting control luciferase signal values from experimental luciferase signal values to obtain relative luciferase signal values. Next, protein level expression was measured by quantifying the number of pixels in a given protein band as visualized on film, using the publicly available software ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Normalized relative luciferase signal was obtained by expressing relative luciferase signal values as a fraction of protein level expression.The integrated transgenes used in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are as follows: trIs41[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(125 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]II; trIs69[pPRKC404(him-4p::PAT-2::CFP)(100 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]; trIs73[pPRKC638.2(him-4p::UNC-40::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(100 ng/ul)]; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)].The ability of EVA-1 truncations to co-immunoprecipitate UNC-40 was performed by establishing extrachromosomal transgenes in the trIs41 integrated strain, and by following the aforementioned co-immunoprecipitation protocol: pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry), pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ866(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL1+2)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ867(him-4p::EVA-1(CYTO)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ868(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL1)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ869(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL2)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRAVS927.5(him-4p::EVA-1(PAT-2-TM)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP). EVA-1 truncation constructs were all injected at 10 ng/ul together with pPRGS382 at 2 ng/ul.For protein level analysis of MADD-4 transgenes, total protein was obtained by sonnication and flash freezing worm lysates of respective integrated strains as described above. 20 ul containing 50 ng of total protein in 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer was analyzed by western blot. Blots were analyzed using rabbit anti-MADD-4 antibodies (which we made in conjunction with Genscript Inc. by injecting rabbits with MADD-4 peptides) and mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma) for the loading control.HEK293T Cell Surface Binding ExperimentsThe constructs for expressing the five receptors in HEK293T cells are as follows: pPRGS861(CMV8-SS::3XFLAG::EVA-1); pPRGS831(CMV8-SS::3XFLAG::UNC-5(no death domain- see [26]; pPRGS757(pCDNA3-SS::3XFLAG::PAT-2). CMV3-SS:SAX-3::3XFLAG and CMV3-SS::3XFLAG::UNC-40 were obtained from Joe Culotti [14]. The constructs for expressing the MADD-4B and SLT-1 from HEK293T cells are as follows: pPRGS827(pCDNA3-SS::HA::MADD-4B::Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)); and pPRGS854(pCDNA3-SS::HA::SLT-1::Gluc)). All expression plasmids have been sequence verified.HEK293T cells were maintained and transfected in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (DMEM-10% FBS). All transfections were performed using JetPrime transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection). Cell surface Gaussia luciferase binding assays were performed as previously reported [27].To obtain concentrated conditioned culture media containing HA::MADD-4B::Gluc or Gluc::SLT-1::HA, 10 ug of respective expression plasmid was transfected into HEK293T cells, and culture media was changed to DMEM-0.2% FBS. After 24 hours of culture, the conditioned media was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and subsequently concentrated 10 times using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). When necessary, ligands were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells by using an anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) and analyzed by western blot using rabbit anti-HA antibodies (Sigma).For the cell surface binding assays, 2 ug of individual plasmids expressing the various C. elegans receptors (previously described) were transfected into HEK293T cells. 48 hours post-transfection, culture media was removed and cells were incubated with concentrated conditioned media for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then harvested in a solution containing PBS, 0.2% BSA and protease inhibitors (Roche), and lysed in TNTE buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. C. elegans receptors were immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (SIGMA), and were washed once in lysis buffer, and then in TNTE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor; five times for HA::MADD-4B::Gluc and 3 times for Gluc::SLT-1::HA ligands. One third of the immunoprecipitate was taken for Gaussia luciferase assays by using the BioLux Kit (NEB) and MicroLumat Plus LB96V luminometer (BERTHOLD). Remainder of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blot using rabbit anti-Flag antibodies (NEB).MADD-4-EVA-1 Interaction Analysis In Vivo To assay the ability of MADD-4::YFP (from the trIs66 array) to localize to EVA-1::CFP expressing muscles (from the trIs89 array), transgenic muscles were first identified by fluorescence under the CFP filter, and then re-examined under the YFP filter for presence of MADD-4::YFP. To assay the presence of MADD-4/EVA-1 vesicles, muscles were first identified for co-expression of both MADD-4::YFP (from the trIs78 array) and EVA-1::CFP (from the trIs89 array). These muscles were then examined for the presence of vesicles and were considered a positive score if containing more than two vesicles.Colocalization studies between MADD-4/EVA-1 vesicles and endosomal markers were performed by creating strains that harbor trIs89, trIs78 and either huIs91 or huIs97. huIs91 is a marker for early endosomes and huIs97 is a marker for recycling endosomes; both transgenes were obtained from Rik Korswagen.Integrated transgenes used in these colocalization studies are as follows: trIs66[pPRGS628(unc-119p::MADD-4B::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs78[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]IV; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)]; huIs91[myo-3p::mCherry::RAB-5]; huIs97[myo-3p::mCherry::RAB-11]Test of EVA-1 Sufficiency in Guiding Distal Tip Cells towards MADD-4To test sufficiency of EVA-1, we used the emb-9 promoter similar to previous work [28] to drive EVA-1 expression in the distal tip cells from an extra-chromosomal array, which was first established in N2 wild type animals. Arrays were then crossed into RP2071 unc-5(e53) trIs78IV; trIs30I to generate unc-5(e53) trIs78IV; trIs30I; trEx948 #1(or#2)[pPRKC948(emb-9p::EVA-1::CFP)(10 ng/ul); pPRGS365(myo-2p::CFP)(5 ng/ul)] lines. Distal tip cell migration defects were scored as previously described only in transgenic animals. RNAi-by-feeding experiments were performed as previously reported [29].Characterizing Sub-cellular Localization of EVA-1 and UNC-40Localization of EVA-1::CFP and UNC-40::YFP were examined under 63\u00d7 magnification. Muscle expressed EVA-1::CFP was from an extrachromosomal array harboring pPRGS394(him-4p::EVA-1::CFP)(10 ng/ul) and pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul). Muscle expressed UNC-40::YFP came from the trIs34 transgene."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Flow Cytometry of CD14, VDR, Cyp27 and Cyp24 and TLR4 in U937 Cells", "keywords": " 25 vitamin D, Inflammation,

To generate the pPIF4\u2237PIF4-HA pif4pif5 transgenic lines, a genomic fragment, including a 2.4-kb promoter region and the full-length PIF4 coding sequence without stop codon, was amplified with the PIF4promoter-f and PIF4_YFPr primers and cloned into the pENTRY S/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) vector. The pPIF4\u2237PIF41A construct was obtained by substituting the NcoI\u2013AgeI fragment of the pPIF4\u2237PIF4 TOPO plasmid with the corresponding fragment, including the PIF41A mutation. These genomic regions were mobilized by LR clonase into the pGWB13-pPZP destination vector and transformed via Agrobacterium into the pif4pif5 mutant. bes1-D PIF41A plants were generated by crossing the pPIF4\u2237PIF41A-HA plants into the bes1-D pif4pif5 mutants.Seeds were transferred to vertical MS plates supplemented with the different chemical treatments and grown in darkness or continuous red light for 5\u20137 d, as specified. Plates were photographed, and the ImageJ software was used to measure the seedlings\u2019 hypocotyl length. Diurnal growth and protein accumulation studies were performed in plants grown in short days (8 h light/16 h dark).Protein interaction assaysThe full-length BIN2, PIF4, and BES1 coding regions were cloned into the pENTRY S/D-TOPO vector for recombination into the yeast and plant expression vectors. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with the GATEWAY-modified pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors (Clontech). Both bait and prey constructs were transformed into AH109 cells and selected on SD-LTHA medium. For pull-down assays, 35S-Met-radiolabeled PIF4 and BES proteins were synthesized with the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with the bound GST and GST-BIN2 proteins. For co-IP studies, extracts of N. benthamiana leaves expressing the BIN2-HA and PIF4-GFP proteins were incubated with anti-HA magnetic beads (\u03bcMACS epitope tag, Miltenyi Biotec), and 15 \u03bcL (anti-HA) and 35 \u03bcL (anti-GFP) of the immunoprecipitated fraction were used for detection of the proteins. The BIN2 and PIF4 coding regions were fused to the N-terminal and C-terminal YFP fragments of the YFN43 and YFC43 vectors and coinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Leaves were observed 2 d after infiltration.In vitro kinase and phosphorylation assaysPIF4-His, PIF41A-His, MBP-BES1, and BIN2-GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione agarose (Clontech), amylose agarose (New England Biolabs), or Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) beads. For in vitro kinase assays, PIF4-His, MBP-BES1, and GST-BIN2 proteins were coincubated with 32P\u03b3-ATP for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. Two micromolar and 20 \u03bcM of the BIN2 kinase inhibitor bikinin (Calbiochem) were added to the incubation mix for specific inhibition.

Single-cell separation1.  Take all the necessary reagents from -20~^\u00b0C , where are stocked, and let them thaw on ice for 30 min before starting the experiment. Just before starting, take the reagents kept at 4^\u00b0C and put them on ice during its use. Caution: The plate must not be placed on ice.2.  Remove the black plastic situated at the button of the integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) plate.3.  Before starting, turn on the C1 machine since it takes some time to start up (about 3 min).4.  Pipette several reagents following this scheme:\u00b0leddash . Add 200ul of Harvest reagent. This well is like a button with a plastic lid on an iron spindle. To apply the reagent, press slightly with the tip, and once slips down, put the tip on the space. Then add slowly the reagent. As can be seen in Figure 3.\u00b0led2 .

If so, wipe the bottom with ethanol 70% and place it again.6.  Run the mode STA:Prime 1782\u00d7/1783\u00d7/1784\u00d7) \u2013 according to the selected size of channels of the chip. This procedure takes 10-12 min. While priming, prepare the cell mixture.7.  Prepare the cell mixture: 30ul of cell suspension and 20ul of suspension reagent. Note: Less amount of cell mix can be prepared as long as the ratio is maintained. For instance, 6 \u03bcl and 4 \u03bcl.8.  After priming is finished, click eject and take out the plate.9.  Remove the leftovers of C1 blocking reagent with a P200 pipette (wells are indicated in Figure 2- 3 ).()Figure 2. Representation of IFC plate indicating the wells to add the different reagents and solutions. Same number indicates same solution and volume. The wells covered in grey, represent the section of the chip that is covered by a film of paper, which at the end of the experiment will contain, each single-cell sample pre-amplified ready to use in sc-qPCR.()Figure 3.

Meanwhile, prepare the Lysis Mix, RT Mix and PreAmp Mix (Recipes 3, 4 and 5).14. When Loading is complete, withdraw the plate from the C1 and take pictures of the cells with Keyence microscope. Using the Phase contrast at 10\u00d7 , channels and fluorescence-stained cells can be easily observed on the central part of the plate, colored in grey color in Figure 4. Also each well number can also be observed.15. Write down the channels with dead cells, empty channels and channels with more than one cell to be discarded a posteriori (Figure 5).()Figure 5. Example of Live/Dead staining. Green cells are living cells while read are dead, or highly damaged cells. Moreover, right chamber shows a doublet, and left one shows a clear single cell.C.

We usually leave it overnight and collect it next morning to proceed with the experiments. The process itself takes 5-6h approximately.4.  When STA: Preamp process has finished, select EJECT and remove the IFC plate.5.  Using a new PCR 96-well plate, add 25ul of C1 dilution reagent in each well.6.  Remove the papers than protect the output wells on IFC plate (those covers are represented in grey color in Figures 2, 4 and 6).7.  Using an eight-channel micropipette (Rainin), transfer the samples onto the 96-well plate. Note: The amount of sample should be close to 3mu I_i , but to ensure, please set the micropipette at 4mu I. .8.  Transfer the samples using this specific order, described in Figure 7. Note: Using 8-channel micropipette, and taking in consideration that IFC plate has 16 well per lane, it has the specific size to pic up every-other well.()Figure 7. Scheme to illustrate the order of well transfer from IFC plate to PCR 96-well plate9.  Vortex the 96-well plate and spin down. At this point, the samples can be frozen at -20~^\u00b0C and be kept for few weeks before use, in that case, seal the plate with a PCR-plate film.# D.  Single-cell qPCR1.  Take all the necessary reagents from -20~^\u00b0C , where are stocked, and let them thaw on ice for30 min before starting the experiment.

Prepare the Taqman assays Mix (Recipe 7) and seal the plate with PCR-plate film.12. Vortex both plates for 10 sec and spin down.13. When priming is complete, collect the chip.14. Transfer the samples and the Taqman assays. In the following order (Figures 9 and 10):()Figure 9. Scheme of 96.96 chip showing in yellow color the inlets to insert Taqman assays and, in green, the inlets to insert sample premix\u00b0leddash . Add 5~ul of Taqman assays in the yellow inlets, using the following order (Figure 10A) to transfer from qPCR 96-well plate to IFC chip.\u00b0led2 . Add 5ul of Sample Premix, using the same order (Figure 10A) in the green inlets.Notes:a.  The inlet wall is not horizontal, but has a diagonal angle. To ensure better application; the best option is insert the tip inclined, as is illustrated in Figure 10B.b.  Avoid bubbles when pipetting. However, if there are bubbles but they move, means that they are on the surface, and then they will not interfere in the analysis. If bubbles do not move, with a micropipette tip remove the bubble.()Figure 10. Scheme of order and methodology to transfer samples into 96.96 chip. A.

Six to eight weeks after injections, whole-mount, hematoxylin and eosin, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to evaluate the type and extent of growth of the DCIS-like lesions. To identify tumor-initiating cells, putative human breast stem/progenitor subpopulations were sorted from MCF10DCIS.COM and SUM-225 with flow cytometry, and their in vivo growth fractions were compared with the Fisher's Exact test.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsIntraductal transplantation methodRecipients are 6- to 10-week-old virgin female SCID-beige mice. Before transplantation, cells are resuspended as single cells in PBS and counted from DCIS.COM, SUM225, or primary human DCIS cells. A 30-gauge Hamilton syringe, 50-\u03bcl capacity, with a blunt-ended 1/2-inch needle is used to deliver the cells. The mice are anesthetized, and a Y-incision is made on the abdomen to allow the skin covering the inguinal mammary fat pads to be peeled back to expose the inguinal gland. The nipple of the inguinal gland is snipped so that the needle can be directly inserted through the nipple. Two microliters of cell-culture medium (with 0.1% trypan blue) containing cells at a concentration of 2,500 to 5,000 cells/\u03bcl are injected; the injected liquid can be visually detected in the duct. The skin flaps are repositioned normally and held together with wound clips. The primary human DCIS was chopped very finely by using a Teflon block and razor blade or scalpel followed by overnight enzymatic digestion in DMEM/F12 with antibiotics, supplemented with collagenase (1.0 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase (100 U/ml).Animal and human experiments were conducted by following protocols approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Animal Care and Use and Human Subjects Committee. An informed consent was deemed not to be required by the Human Subjects Committee. [See Additional data file 1 for a video demonstration of the intraductal method.]Cell linesMCF10DCIS.COM and SUM-225 were purchased from Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI) and were maintained according to the supplier's guidelines.Histologic proceduresWhole mount and H&E were performed as described previously [8].Immunofluorescence and reagentsImmunofluorescence (IF) was performed after tissue deparaffinization by clearance in xylene and hydration through graded ethanol series. Microwave antigen retrieval (20 min) in 10 m M sodium citrate was performed for all the antibodies used for IF. A 5% solution of bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Tween 20 was used as blocking buffer. Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C: ER\u03b1 rabbit polyclonal 1:50 (Novocastra; 6F11, NCL-ER-6F11, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, UK), anti-human SMA 1:100 (1A4-Dako, M0851, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-mouse SMA 1:200 (A14; Sigma, A2547, St. Louis, MO, USA), CK5 1:50 (XM26, Vector, VP-C400, Burlingame, California, USA), CK8 1:50 (C51, Zymed, 18-0185, San Francisco, California, USA), Her-2 1:50 (SP3, Labvision, RM-9103-SO, Fermont, California, USA), Cytokeratin (AE1/3)1:50 (AE1/AE3, Dako, M3515, Glostrup, Denmark), CK-19 1:50 (Clone A53-B, Lab Vision, MS-198-P0, Fremont, California, USA), and Her-1 1:50 (Clone 31G7, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, California, USA). Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) and TO-PRO-3 iodide (Invitrogen, T3605, Carlsband, California, USA). Secondary antibodies included anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Carlsband, California, USA). Confocal microscopy was performed by using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA). The acquisition software used was LSM image browser (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA). Phase-contrast images were captured with an inverted microscope (CK40-SLP; Olympus). The acquisition software used was Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe).

Assembly of the Micropump Control Circuit For a simplified schematic with color-coded cables refer to Figure 2A. For detailed, step-by step photos of the assembly of the circuit, consult Figures 4-14. For a table listing all the connections required for the mp6 micropump control circuit, see Figure 3.()T1: Teminal Strip 1T2: Teminal Strip 2H1: Horizontal Power Distribution Bus 1V1: Vertical Power Distribution Bus 1V2: Vertical Power Distribution Bus 2V3:Vertical Power Distribution Bus 3Figure 3. Table listing all the breadboard connections required for the mp6 micropump control circuit()Figure 4. Steps 1-4 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.1.  To fit all the necessary components, a breadboard with 3 terminal strips and 63 rows of 10 tie points per terminal strip is required (Figure 4). Such breadboards include the Digilent 340-002-1 or the Wisher WBU-206. Each of these has 5 power distribution buses and 3 terminal strips. Remove (unscrew) the rightmost distribution bus and the adjacent terminal strip.2.  Attach with screws or Velcro pads the two Arduinos\u2013ideally in a staggered fashion to allow easy access to the two USB ports, as shown in Figure 4.3.  Connect the 5 Volt DC Power Supply to the horizontal distribution bus of the breadboard (Figure 4, designated by the red \u201cplus\u201d and the black \u201cminus\u201d signs). Include a simple toggle SPST push button \u201cmaster switch\u201d (not shown), for switching the power supply to the circuit.4.  Connect the power and ground of all vertical distribution buses to 5V and ground, respectively, of the horizontal distribution bus (Figure 4)()Figure 5. Steps 5-6 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.5.  On the middle (now rightmost) terminal strip attach the two 10K-Ohm potentiometers, and connect them to power and ground, as shown in Figure 5.Note: The screws that rotate the wiper and vary the resistance in each potentiometer should be facing away from each other, therefore allowing enough clearance for the mini screwdriver that will be used to make adjustments in Step 6.6.  Using a mini screwdriver, adjust voltage to get 1.3 across the wiper of the top potentiometer and 1.8or across the bottom.Note: For safety, you should disconnect the power supply when proceeding with the next steps of the protocol.()Figure 6. Steps 7-8 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.7.  On the terminal strip that includes the two potentiometers also install the two 8-channel logic level converters (Figure 6). Connect VCCB on each logic level converter to 5V and GND to ground (Figure 6; also refer to Figure 2A for pinout diagram and voltage information).8.  Connect VCCA and OE on the top logic level converter to 1.3or and on the bottom converter to 1.8 V (see gray jumper wires in Figures 6; also refer to Figure 2A for voltage and pin information).9.  Attach the 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. Use the shield stacking headers to elevate the Breakout Board, and therefore allow enough clearance for the third and fourth mp6-OEM controllers that will be attached next (Step 10) and are directly adjacent to the Breakout Board (see Figure 15D).()Figure 7. Steps 9-14 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.10. Connect the six mp6-OEM controllers to the leftmost terminal strip of the breadboard as shown in Figure 7 (also refer to Figure 2A).Note: The bottom two mp6-OEM controllers will supply the inflow lines (perfusing the top and bottom sides of the mesh) of the bath of the interface chamber, and their flow rate is adjustable by the bottom Arduino Uno, which is connected to Pin 2 (Cyan, added in Step 22) (Figure 2, and Figures 15A and 15B). The top four OEMs are connected to the four-pump array that supplies the suction (Figure 15C), and their flow rate is constant (set at maximal). For these OEMs, Pin 2 and Pin 3 are shorted and do not receive any input from the bottom Arduino Uno (Figure 2A). Also notice that in all six of the OEMs Pin 5 and Pin 10 are unused.11. Short Pins 11 and 12 on all six mp6-OEMs, using U-shaped loops made out of cut jumper wires, long enough to connect two contacts on adjacent breadboard rows (see six-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).12. Similarly, short Pins 2 and 3 of the top four OEMs (see five-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).13. Connect the ground (Black) to Pin 1, marked with a white spot of all six mp6-OEMs (Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).14. Connect 5 V (Red) to Pin 14 of all six mp6-OEMs, as shown in Figure 7 (refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).()Figure 8. Step 15 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.15. Connect 1.3 V (Yellow), from A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 of the top logic level converter, to Pin 4 of all six mp6-OEMs (Figure 8; only two such connections are shown in the schematic of Figure 2A).()Figure 9. Step 16 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.16. Connect 1.8 V (Orange), from A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 of the bottom logic level converter, to Pin 13 of all six mp6-OEMs. (Figure 9; only two such connections are shown in the schematic of Figure 2A).()Figure 10. Steps 17-18 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.17. Connect Pin 6 (Brown) to Pins Left 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 10).18. Connect Pin 7 (Green) to Pins Left 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 10).()Figure 11. Steps 19-20 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.19. Connect Pin 8 (Blue) to Pins Right 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 11).20. Connect Pin 9 (Purple) to Pins Left 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 11).()Figure 12. Step 21 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.21. Connect Inputs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 of the top logic level converter to Digital Pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively, of the top Arduino Uno, as shown in Figure 12 (White cables).()Figure 13. Step 22 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.22. Connect Inputs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 of the bottom logic level converter to Digital Pins 8, 9,10, 11, 12, 13, respectively, of the top Arduino Uno, as shown in Figure 13 (Magenta cables).()Figure 14. Step 23 and complete overview of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.23. Connect Outputs 9 and 10 (PWM0 and PWM1) of the bottom Arduino Uno to Pin 2 (Cyan) of the bottom two OEMs (Figure 14).24. Connect one of the Digital outputs of the ADC to TX 1 and GDN of the top Arduino Uno (Figure2A). This connection will turn on and off the recirculation perfusion controlled by the mp6 pumps, as directed by the winLTP Program.25. Connect the two Arduino Uno units to the computer, using USB connection.26. Connect the GDN of the bottom Arduino to the central ground of the electrophysiology rig. (Figure 2A. The top Arduino is grounded via the ADC ground\u2014see Step 24).27. Copy and load into the top Arduino controlling all six micropumps (Microcontroller 1) the program shown in Figure 18.28. Copy and load into the bottom Arduino controlling the two inflow micropumps (Microcontroller 2) the program shown in Figure 19.B.  Assembly of the mp6 micropump array (see reference 29)1.  Assemble the six cables connecting the six Molex connectors (one per mp6 micropump) to the Breakout Board 26-pin ribbon cable, as shown in Figures 2B and 15E. The color scheme of Figures 2B and 2C serves as a guide. Use four male gold-plated pins and a 32AWG 4-wire multi-conductor cable (e.g., the MC001 Alpha Wire Multi-Conductor Cable) to connect the four pins of the Molex connector to the ribbon cable. Each Molex connector and associated multicolor cable will be inserted into four sockets of the ribbon cable (wire arrangement, clockwise from top left socket: brown, purple, blue, green; repeat for all six Molex connectors). Only 24 (6\u00d74) out of the 26 sockets of the ribbon cable will be used.Note: Disregard the colors of the Alpha Wire multicolor cables in Figures 15A, 15B, 15C, 15E and ^15F, which are unrelated to the color scheme of Figure 2B.2.  Position both components as indicated in Figure 2C, the mp6/mp6-pp facing upwards (with its company logo and serial number markings visible from above), and the Molex connector with the four small openings facing down. Then slide the mp6/mp6-pp flex into the Molex connector. Clamp the Molex connector to complete the connection between both components.3.  Manufacture three custom-made plexiglass spacers similar to the ones shown in Figures 15A and 15B. Also prepare cork pads cut to size in order to compensate for differences in the thickness of the micropump and the Molex connectors.4.  Make an assembly consisting of two mp6 micropumps as shown in Figures 15A (front) and 15B (side) as follows: First, glue the marked side of micropump 1 (mp6-1) on the plexiglass spacer using double-sided adhesive tape. Glue cork pads to the unmarked side of the first micropump. The order of parts in the resulting component is: plexiglass/mp6-1/cork.5.  Repeat these steps for micropump 2 (mp6-2), but in the opposite order, i.e., with the cork pad glued to marked side and the plexiglass spacer on the unmarked. The order of parts in the resulting component is: cork/mp6-2/plexiglass.6.  Build a four mp6 micropump assembly (Figure 15C) consisting of the two plexiglass spacer/mp6/cork pad components, by placing the third (unglued) plexiglass spacer in between, so that order of parts in the completed array is: plexiglass/mp6-1/cork/plexiglass/cork/mp6-2/plexiglass.7.  The resulting assembly can be held together either with pieces of double-sided adhesive tape, or by a clamp, or with long screws that pass through drilled holes into the plexiglass spacers. In the latter case, make sure to tap threads into the holes of only one out of the three spacers.8.  Make mini-Faraday cages out of copper wire mesh (Figure 15F) to allow the elimination of the noise generated by the piezoelectric micropumps (see Note 3). Ground the mini Faraday cages on the main ground of the airtable.9.  The completed assemblies consist of either two or four mp6 micropumps (Figure 15F). As discussed above, four pumps connected in parallel are required for the suction, and two pumps with independent inlets and outlets perfuse the top and bottom of the hippocampal slice, from both sides of the mesh in the recording chamber.()Figure 15. Different views of the assembled micropump arrays and associated components. A and B. Two mp6 micropumps are stacked in parallel connection, which causes their volume flows to summate. Each such \u201csandwich\u201d array consists of three custom-made plexiglass panels, one of which is threaded so that screws can hold the assembly together. Cork pads cut to size allow for precise contact of different surfaces. C. Two assemblies shown in (A) and (B) stacked on top of each other, constitute the pump array that controls the suction. Notice the y connectors and mp-cv valves. D. The 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board is connected to 26-pin shield stacking headers with longer pins, so as to allow enough clearance for two of the mp6-OEM controllers that are attached directly adjacent to it. E. Cable that connects six micropumps to the Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. F. Mini-Faraday cages made of copper wire mesh to allow grounding the noise from the pumps.Note: Alpha Wire multiconductor cables have their own color scheme which is unrelated to the color scheme of Figures 2B, 2C, 9 and 11.# Part II: Rodent Hippocampal Slice Preparation1.  Prepare Dissection and Recording Solutions: Prepare two stock 10\u00d7 ACSF solutions, one for dissection (Dissection 10x ACSF) and one for recording (Recording 10x ACSF). Maintain the two stock 10\u00d7 ACSF solutions at 4^\u00b0C until the day of the experiment.2.  On the day of the experiment, prepare 1\u00d7 Dissection ACSF and 1x Recording ACSF.3.  Oxygenate both solutions for at least 20 min at room temperature with 15%oslash_2/5%subset O_2 .4.  Reducing the temperature of the slice helps prevent ischemic damage (see Note 2). To rapidlychill room-temperature 1\u00d7 Dissection ACSF Buffer to an appropriate cold temperature without freezing the buffer, place it into a -70~^\u00b0C freezer for 45~m i n . If ice crystals form, remove them with a small spoon or sieve to avoid contact with, and possible damage to the brain tissue. After removing from the freezer continue to oxygenate the Dissection ACSF with 95% O_2/5% C O_2 at 4^\u00b0C .5.  Prepare the interface electrophysiology rig: Heat the water jacket of the interface chamber so that the temperature of the recording chamber is 31.5 ^\u00b0C . Preheat 250-500 m of the 1\u00d7 Recording ACSF by placing it in a 32~^\u00b0C water bath while oxygenating with 95% O_2/5% C O_2. . The purpose of preheating the solution to a temperature slightly above the temperature of the recording chamber is to prevent the formation of bubbles in the tubes and under the mesh when the solution is heated again after passing from the heat jacket. Start perfusing the bath with 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 ul/min .6.  Deeply anesthetize the animal in the anesthesia chamber, using an Isoflurane vaporizer: Apply 100% O_2 for 2 min, followed by 100%~O_2+1.5% Isoflurane for 1 m i n , followed by 100%cal O_2+ 2.5% Isoflurane for 2 min.7.  When the animal is deeply anesthetized, decapitate it with a small animal guillotine. Submerge the decapitated head inside a metal surgical tray sitting on ice in an icebox and filled with oxygenated ice-cold 1\u00d7 Dissection ACSF. Note: Following the decapitation of the animal, the preparation of the brain slices should be completed within less than 10 min.8.  Quickly remove the brain: expose the skull by making an incision with a single edge razor blade on the scalp.9.  Using a pair of surgical scissors with their sharp pointed blade working along the inner side of the skull, cut along the sagittal suture from the foramen magnum to the forehead.10. Using the surgical scissors, make one cut at the foramen magnum on each temporal side of the skull, then cut across the frontal bone along the coronal suture. Carefully pry the skull open with a rongeur and expose the brain.11. Holding the skull upside down, sever the cranial nerves that hold the brain to the skull using a spatula and allow the brain to fall into a 50m beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.12. Using an icebox, transfer the beaker with the brain to a 4^\u00b0C cold room.13. Isolate the hippocampus: use a 90m m Pyrex Culture Petri Dish covered with a moistened filter paper as a dissecting platform.14. Place the chilled brain on the platform and bisect it along the longitudinal fissure. Place the right hemibrain in a 50ml beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.15. To isolate the hippocampus of the left hemibrain, sever what remains of the midbrain and brain-stem using a flat spatula. Scoop out the thalamus to expose the ventral face of the hippocampus nested inside the cortex and clearly visible as a curved structure. Sever the septal and temporal connections of the hippocampus from the cortex with a spatula. Using afilled plastic Pasteur pipet, gently squeeze a few droplets of ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF into the pocket of the lateral ventricle to distinguish the border of the fimbria.16. Gently insert into the lateral ventricle a fine brush moistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF and roll the hippocampus out gently from the surrounding cortex. Isolate the peeled-out hippocampus by cutting it free from the cortex using a flat spatula. Place the left hippocampus in a ^20ml beaker with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.17. Repeat previous steps with right hippocampus.18. Slicing: The slicing stage should be prepared in advance and can be reused multiple times. It consists of a circular thin piece of cork pad of equal diameter to the plastic disc of the McIlwain tissue chopper and glued on it with parallel pieces of double-sided adhesive tape. The clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform can be adjusted to match the thickness of the slicing stage (Figure 16C).19. Place a piece of filter paper on the slicing stage and moisten it with chilled oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.20. Using a fine brush (or a spatula with its flat side bent at right angles) gently lift the hippocampus from the bottom of the beaker.()Figure 16. Photographs showing proper positioning of the left rat hippocampus on the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (refer to text for details)21. Lay the isolated hippocampus on the slicing stage with its top side up (the dorsal face containing the alveus). It is often possible to view striations on the alvear surface of this side, with oblique light from a fiber optic. Using the brush gently straighten the bottom surface of the hippocampus so that it lies completely flush on the moistened filter paper.22. Only the dorsal hippocampus will be sliced from each side. To immobilize the hippocampus, one may therefore affix the ventral hippocampus (the thicker end) on the cork of the slicing stage with an insect pin (Figure 16A).23. Slide the slicing stage with the affixed hippocampus through the clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (Figure 16C).24. Rotate the slicing stage on the platform so that the dorsal hippocampus is properly oriented with respect to the razor blade: the blade should make a 15^\u00b0 angle with the transverse axis of the dorsal hippocampus (Figures 16B, 16C). Excitatory pathways are better preserved when an angle of 15 to 30^\u00b0 from this axis is used (Alger et al., 1984). In general, the alvear striations will tend to run parallel to the blade at this orientation. If the hippocampus on the left hemibrain is used, it will look like an upright \u201cU\u201d as viewed from above with the dorsal hippocampus on the right and the (pinned) ventral hippocampus on the left (Figures 16A-16C). To achieve the proper cutting angle, rotate the slicing stage 15^\u00b0 counterclockwise. Similarly, if the right hippocampus is used, it will resemble an inverted \u201cU\u201d, and the stage is rotated 15^\u00b0 clockwise.25. Wet the blade with ACSF and make the slices by lowering the blade through the hippocampus. Each slice should stick on the wet surface of the blade as it ascends. The first 3 (most dorsal) complete slices are usually discarded. Depending on the age of the animal, 6 to 8 slices of 450 mm thickness can be obtained from rats (Figure 16B) and 4-5 such slices from mice. The speed and the strength of impact of the blade should be adjusted so that the slices are cut gently, but quickly enough to avoid sticking of the uncut hippocampus on the ascending blade. The blade should not slam on the surface of the cutting stage; ideally it should just dimple the surface of the wet filter paper on the chopping stage.26. Quickly remove the slices from the blade as they are produced using a moistened fine sable brush. Immediately after making each slice, transfer it to a test tube filled with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Take great care to avoid stretching or excessively bending the slices during handling. One method is to pick the slices from the blade with the brush premoistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF, using a gentle rolling motion. Some of the ACSF moisture on the brush will also stick on the blade and help the next slice stick to the blade after it has been sliced off the hippocampus.27. Immediately after making the slices, transfer them to the interface recording chamber to recover for at least ^2h . The slices should rest on a mesh at the gas-liquid interface, forming a small meniscus around them (Figures 17A, 17B and 17C), and should be constantly superfused from both their top and bottom side with (non-recirculating) 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 ul/min .Note: Please also consult the following video articles offering detailed information on acute hippocampal slice preparation for long-term recordings: Villers and Ris (2013); Shetty et al. (2015).()Figure 17. Photographs showing proper positioning of a rat hippocampal slice in an Oslo-type interface recording chamber. A. The slice lies on a mesh, near the wall of a recording bath. The chamber has two such recording baths, both of which are covered by a removable convex canopy that creates a humidified, oxygen-rich atmosphere above the slice.The canopy has a triangular opening that allows recording from each slice individually (while the slice in the other bath remains covered). Each slice is constantly superfused with ACSF flowing into the bath through an inflow tube and out through an outflow conduit (across from the inflow), which leads to the suction well (the suction is provided by a yellow syringe needle). B and C. At interface, a small meniscus is formed around the slice. A larger meniscus is formed around the walls of the bath.# Part III: Application of oligodeoxynucleotides to slices in recirculation modeIn ODN experiments, after recovery from dissection in interface mode, increase the bath level to fully submerge the slices and allow the superfusate containing 20~uM of the oligodeoxynucleotide to recirculate '5ml total volume at 5 ml/min for 30m i n ). To achieve this, follow these steps:1.  Copy and load the program of Figure 18 on the top Arduino of Figure 14 (\u201cMicrocontroller 1\u201d in Figure 2A). Change the value of \u201cdelay\u201d to ^18000000^ , save the new program and reload to top Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of ADC via the winLTP program, the top Arduino will turn on all six of the micropumps for 30m i n .2.  Load the Arduino PWM library (see link) and copy and load the program of Figure 19 on the bottom Arduino of Figure 14 (\u201cMicrocontroller z^ in Figure 2). Change the \u201cint32_t clockfrequency\u201d value to ^\u00b0200^\u00b0 , save the new program and reload to the bottom Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of the ADC via the winLTP program, the bottom two pumps will supply a flow rate of 5 mL/min (Figure 20) to the inlets of the recording chamber (the four ouflow pumps of the suction, once on, will always operate at maximum flow rate).3.  Turn off the peristaltic pump, and at the same time turn off the vacuum suction.4.  Turn on the piezoelectric pump circuit using the SPST push button master switch.5.  Use a three-way valve to manually switch between the peristaltic pump drawing solution from a main reservoir (typically a 250~ml Erlenmeyer flask held inside a water bath with a clamp) and the two-micropump assembly of the bath inlet, which should be drawing solution from a 15~m conical tube containing the recirculating solution with the ODN (inside the same water bath as the main reservoir).6.  Start the winLTP program with Sequential Protocol Scripting and Automated Perfusion Control (Anderson et al., 2012; see also Chapter 10 of the WinLTP software manual (Anderson, 2018). Note: The automated perfusion control is currently only supported by National Instruments M- or X-Series ADC boards). Use the Slow0 Perfusion Change for controlling one perfusion line to one extracellular slice chamber.()Figure 18. Arduino program that activates simultaneously all six mp6 oems and keeps them active for a designated period. The program allows turning all six of the mp6 micropumps on simultaneously when prompted by one of the digital outputs of the ADC, which is in turn controlled by the \u201cSlow0 Perfusion Change\u201d function of the winLTP program. By changing the \u201cdelay\u201d value (highlighted in yellow) the slices can be perfused for variable intervals. In this particular example the pumps will remain on for 1800000 ms (i.e., 30 min).()The library allows for a frequency range from 1Hz - 2MHz on 16 bit timers and 31Hz - 2 MHz on 8 bit timers. When SetPinFrequency()/SetPinFrequencySafe() is called, a bool is returned which can be tested to verify the frequency was actually changed. This example runs on arduino mega and uno. ^/#include <PWM.h>int ClockA =9 ; // the pin that the clock is attached to int ClockB =10 ; // the pin that the clock is attached to int clockduty =242;//95% duty cycle int32_t clockfrequency =75 /frequency (in Hz)void setup()//initialize all timers except for O, to save time keeping functions InitTimersSafe();void loop()I/set clock to max pwmWrite(ClockA, clockduty); SetPinFrequency(ClockA, clockfrequency); I/set clock to max pwmWrite(ClockB, clockduty); SetPinFrequency(ClockB, clockfrequency); delay(250);Figure 19. Arduino program that performs pulse width modulation (PWM). The program allows changing the frequency of the signal generated by the mp6-OEM from the default value, to reduce the mp6 micropump flow volume from its maximum value (5.5ml/min) . The frequency of the OEM signal is altered by changing the value of \u201cint32_t clockfrequency\u201d(highlighted in yellow). The current value \u201cint32_t clockfrequency = 75\u201d yields a flow rate of approximately 2.5 ml/min (see Figure 20).Note: Library download link:https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino-pwm-frequency-library/downloads.Note: The digital output from the National Instruments M- or X-Series board is connected to Arduino 1, and it will activate both the assembly consisting of the two independent micropumps that control the inlets to the bath, as well as the multipump array that controls the suction. Make sure the tube at the output of the aspirator leads the solution back to the 15 ml conical tube to complete the recirculation circuit.7.  If necessary, adjust the height of the suction tube in the suction well of the chamber to raise the bath level and fully submerge the slice.8.  After 30~m i n of recirculation in the submersion mode and to begin recording, lower the bath level of the ODN-containing solution by lowering the aspirator tube to interface level and return the flow rate to 0.5ml/min for the remainder of the experiment by changing the \u201cint32_t clockfrequency\u201d value from 200 to 10, and loading again the program of Figure 19 to the Bottom Arduino Uno.()clockFreqFigure 20. Changing the flow rate of single mp6 micropump by pulse-width modulation (PWM). By inserting different values for \u201cint32_t clockfrequency\u201d ( dotx -axis of the graph), the flow rate (y-axis) can be changed from the low rates of a few hundred microliters per min (shown in the insert) required for interface chamber recordings, to a maximal flow rate of 5.5ml/min .9.  Place stimulating and recording electrodes in the hippocampal layers of interest and begin electrophysiological recordings.10. For experiments to study long-term synaptic plasticity lasting many hours, record field EPSPs (fEPSPs) with a glass extracellular recording electrode (2-5 M\u03a9) placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum, with concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes placed on either side within CA3 or CA1. Exclude from study slices if initial analysis shows fEPSP spike threshold <2m V. Confirm independence between the two stimulated pathways by the absence of paired-pulse facilitation between the two pathways. Set the baseline fEPSP at 25% of the spike threshold and monitor it by delivering stimuli at 0.033H z to each pathway. Induce LTP by strong HFS, consisting, for example, of standard two 100 H z-1s tetanic trains, spaced 20 s apart, which is optimized to produce a relatively rapid onset of protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP (Tsokas et al., 2005; Tsokas et al., 2016, Hsieh et al., 2017). For rat hippocampal slices deliver the tetanus at 70% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2017), and for mouse slices use 25% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2016). The maximum slope of the rise of the fEPSP can be analyzed on a PC using the WinLTP data acquisition program (Anderson and Collingridge, 2007).# Notes1.  Comparison of interface and submersion chamber: oxygenation and efficacy of aPKC inhibitor ZIP on synaptic transmissionMost studies examining long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices, employ Oslo-type interface recording chambers, rather than submerged chambers, because the former are believed to provide superior oxygenation and preservation of normal synaptic function (Khurana and Li, 2013). We tested this assumption, by using a galvanic dissolved-oxygen probe (Atlas Scientific KIT-106; zinc anode, silver cathode, 15% sodium tetraborate 15% sodium chloride electrolyte; polyethylene membrane) to measure the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Oslo-type interface recording chamber and in the same chamber used in submersion mode with flow rates ranging from 2 to 15ml/min .The dissolved oxygen probe was calibrated using distilled water and ambient air, as described by the manufacturer. The accuracy of the instrument was further tested by measuring dissolved atmospheric oxygen in ACSF ( 14,000~uS/cm) at room temperature (23.5 ^\u00b0C) . The average value (8.1pm0.01~mg/L~ ; n=5^ ) was in agreement with previously reported data for atmospheric dissolved oxygen equilibrium at different temperatures and salinity conditions (Radtke et al., 1998).Air from a medical air cylinder, or 100% oxygen (both from TW Smith) was then bubbled through the gas dispersion ring (or the ceramic aerators) of the water jacket of the Oslo-type chamber at 31.5 ^\u00b0C , and the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured inside the recording chamber, under interface conditions, with the probe clamped on a micromanipulator and held a few millimeters above the surface of the mesh (where the meniscus surrounding the slice is normally formed). A standard curve of oxygen saturation vs. concentration was thus generated for the tip of the probe moistened with ACSF (6.9pm0.3mg/L at 21%  O_2 ; 31.1pm0.8 m g/L at 100%  O_2 ; n=5 ; linear fit through 0, r^2=0.99^ . With 15%igcirc_2-5% C O_2 bubbling through the water jacket, the oxygen concentration immediately above the slice at the interface was 29.6pm0.7:m g/L 95.1pm2.3% saturation; n=5 ).The Oslo-type chamber was then converted into a submersion chamber: the suction was raised to increase the level of the superfusate inside the recording bath, the oxygenation via the aerators in the water jacket was turned off, and the flow rate was increased to obtain oxygen concentration/saturation measurements at 2, 5, 10 and 15~m l/m i n . Under submersion conditions, and immediately above the position where the slice would be in an actual experiment, the following oxygen concentration (m g/L) and % saturation measurements were obtained  n^ s=4 )\u20142 ml/min: 19.6pm0.9 (62.5pm2.8%) ); 5 ml/min: 22.7pm:1.4 (72.4pm4.6% ); 10 ml/min: 25.5~pm~1.7 ( 81.6~pm~5.7% ); and 15 ml/min: 26.9~pm~1.9 (86.3~pm~6.2%) . These measurements are in agreement with values reported for different types of submersion chambers described elsewhere, using carbon-fiber microelectrodes, DO optical sensors, polarographic cells (i.e., amperometric Clark electrodes), or a colorimetric chemical (indigo carmine) methods (H\u00e1jos et al., 2009; Dondzillo et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2018).These results demonstrate that the oxygen saturation in the superfusate of submersion chambers (see, for example, Volk et al., 2013) is substantially lower than in the humidified atmosphere that envelops slices in Oslo-type interface chambers, especially at the flow rates commonly used ( 72.4pm4.6% for a submersion chamber with flow rate 5ml/min , compared to 95.1pm2.3% for an Oslo-type interface chamber). The effects of lower oxygen saturation on slice health might be further exacerbated when the slices are recovered under submerged conditions after preparation (as in Volk et al., 2013).We next asked whether the differences of oxygenation obtained in interface vs. submerged chambers have physiological effects on synaptic physiology. We specifically addressed whether chamber design might explain a difference that has been reported in the effects of the atypical PKC inhibitor ZIP on basal synaptic transmission. Whereas consistently ZIP reverses late-LTP in all published studies in which it has been studied (see, for example Ling et al., 2002; Sajikumar et al., 2005; Pastalkova et al., 2006), in most of these studies the effect of the PKM\u03b6 inhibitor is specific to potentiated synaptic pathways with no effect on basal, untetanized synaptic pathways. This specificity of the inhibitor to potentiated and not basal synaptic transmission is identical to results obtained with applications of the agent to LTP and basal synaptic transmission recorded in vivo (Pastalkova et al., 2006; Madro\u00f1al et al., 2010). However, one study reported that ZIP had effects on both late-LTP and baseline synaptic transmission (Volk et al., 2013). This study, however, was unusual in that the late-LTP recordings and basal synaptic transmission were recorded in hippocampal slices held in a submerged chamber.We therefore directly compared the effects of ZIP on LTP and baseline synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices recorded in an interface and in a submersion chamber. To keep all other parameters as constant as possible, the interface chamber slices recovered in the same chamber in which their recordings take place; whereas the submersion chamber slices were placed in an interface chamber, which was then immediately converted into a submersion chamber by increasing the flow rate and bath level of the ACSF solution, and the slices were then allowed to recover for another 90 min (the total recovery time of both sets of slices in the two experiments is kept equal).As seen in Figure 21, in slices recovered and recorded in an interface chamber, ZIP specifically reverses late-LTP maintenance in the tetanized pathway without affecting basal neurotransmission in the untetanized pathway. In contrast, in slices recorded under submerged conditions, ZIP reverses LTP maintenance, eventually below baseline, and also has an effect on an independent untetanized pathway. This effect of ZIP on the untetanized/basal pathway was similar to that seen in Volk et al. (2013).A plausible explanation for this difference is that there is a pool of atypical PKC involved in neuroprotection from hypoxia (see Tian et al., 2008) that is separate from the pool of PKM\u03b6 that maintains late-LTP. Because the oxygenation conditions in an interface chamber are superior to those for submerged slices, the effect of ZIP on basal neurotransmission in a submersion chamber may reflect the effects of the inhibitor on the neuroprotective role of atypical PKC that is induced by the relatively hypoxic conditions of the slice (Tian et al., 2008). Alternatively, the low-oxygen conditions of submerged chambers may have induced hypoxic LTP in the untetanized synapses, rendering them sensitive to ZIP. Importantly, as mentioned above, the specificity of ZIP to potentiated and not basal synaptic transmission is seen in vivo in the hippocampal perforant path dentate gyrus input (Pastalkova et al., 2006), hippocampal CA3-CA1 (Madro\u00f1al et al., 2010), and layer 4 primary visual cortex (Cooke and Bear, 2010). Thus, high-oxygen interface chambers, but not low-oxygen submerged chambers appear to produce conditions of synaptic transmission and plasticity that more closely reflect in vivo conditions.In addition to inferior oxygenation conditions, another factor that may have contributed to the artifactual response to ZIP of the untetanized pathway in Volk et al. (2013) is the intensity of the conditioning stimulus used to induce late-LTP. The intensity of the Volk et al. (2013) protocol, which was delivered at 75% of the maximum EPSP response, is appropriate for rat Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 synaptic stimulation, but is much higher than what is normally used to induce LTP in mouse hippocampal slices, which is typically between 25% of the spike threshold, as in Tsokas et al. (2016), and 50% of maximum EPSP in Abel et al. (1997), Nguyen et al. (2000), Barco et al. (2002), Opazo et al. (2003), Selcher et al. (2003), Kelleher et al. (2004), Costa-Mattioli et al. (2005), Antion et al. (2008), Pavlowsky and Alarcon (2012), Gruart et al. (2012), Li et al. (2017), Puzzo et al. (2017), Amorim et al. (2018). Such strong repetitive synaptic stimulation in Volk et al. (2013) may have further undermined neuronal health, thereby contributing to the artifactual drop below the baseline of the EPSP in the untetanized pathway in response to ZIP.()A ZIP on wild-type LTP maintenance (interface chamber)()Figure 21. Brain slice late-LTP experiments in an interface vs. submersion chamber. A.B ZIP on wild-type LTP maintenance (submersion chamber)ZIP (5~u M) applied during the maintenance phase of late-LTP reverses potentiation without effect on the untetanized pathway (from Tsokas et al., 2016; n=5 ). B. In contrast, in slices ^n= 3) that have recovered in an interface chamber (for equal time as the slices in A), which was then converted into a submersion chamber by increasing the bath level and flow rate of the ACSF, 5~uM ZIP not only reverses LTP in the tetanized pathway but also decreases basal synaptic transmission in the untetanized pathway. This difference may be due to the superior oxygenation conditions in interface chambers (oxygen saturation is 95.1pm2.3% in an Oslo-type interface chamber, compared to 72.4pm4.6% in a submersion chamber with a typical flow rate of 5m l/m i n) ).2.  Protection from excitotoxicityIn order to protect from excitotoxicity during the slice-making process we recommend using ice-cold high magnesium/low calcium ACSF solutions and performing the slice preparation procedure inside a 4^\u00b0C cold room.Lowering the temperature decreases the metabolic rate of cells thus reducing their energy consumption, allowing the cells to survive ischemia during slice preparation. In addition, we recommend using a special, non-physiological ACSF during dissection (Dissection ACSF) that contains 10~m M magnesium and 0.5~m M calcium. Both these departures from physiological CSF are known to reduce excitotoxicity (Feig and Lipton, 1990; Sacktor et al., 1993; Wang and Kass, 1997; Ting et al., 2018).3.  mp6 micropump noiseThere are two sources of noise in the system: (a) noise from the electrical signal of the OEM, and (b) noise generated in the solution because of the vibration of the ionic ACSF by the pump actuators. These sources of noise can be completely silenced by (a) making a metal enclosure for the circuit and mini-Faraday cages for the pump \u201csandwich\u201d arrays, and (b) grounding the recirculating ACSF both at the inflow to the bath and at the suction, using T-shape tubing connectors with a silver chloride wire connected to the main ground of the rig.4.  Passive check valves mp-cvTo eliminate potential back flow of the ACSF owing to differential pressure between the pump inlet and the outlet (due to differences, for example, between the height of the recording chamber and the height of the ACSF reservoir, or the connecting tubes), use a passive check valve encased in stainless steel manufactured by Bartels Mikrotechnik (mp-cv). The valve, which will influence the volume flow of the micropump, should be placed between the micropump and the outflow reservoir. Figure 15C shows four such mp-cv check valves connected to the array of four mp6 micropumps controlling the suction of the interface recording chamber.5.  Metal enclosure for the piezoelectric pump systemFor safety reasons (to protect against electric shock from the OEMs), as well as to eliminate the noise produced by the OEMs and to protect the circuit from damage, the completed circuit of Figure 14 should be placed inside a metal enclosure that is grounded. The enclosure should have an opening for the ribbon cable of the Breakout Board connecting the micropump assemblies, as well as openings for the power supply cables, the two USB cables of the Arduinos, the master switch of the circuit, and the BNC cable connecting the top Arduino to the ADC board.6.  Hybrid persistaltic/piezoelectric pump arrangementA simplified alternative to the recirculation device described here is to use piezoelectric pumps only for the aspirating the recirculation ACSF, and a peristaltic pump to provide the inflow to the chamber. In this arrangement, a peristaltic pump with a two-channel pump head would control the inflow (alternatively, a four-channel pump head can be used, if the interface chamber supports two independent baths for slices). One piezoelectric array (or two, depending on the number of baths supported by the interface chamber) would control the aspirator, with each array consisting of four mp6 micropumps driven by the suction part of the circuit (i.e., the top four OEMs) at the maximum flow rate.7.  Pre-flushing the dead volume of the perfusion system before switching solutionsWhen 95% O_2^-5% C O_2 -aerated ACSF stays in polyethylene or Tygon tubing for a long time before being perfused onto slices, it degases and becomes hypoxic. The loss of carbon dioxide also alters the pH of the standard bicarbonate buffer of the ACSF. It is therefore important to \u201cpre-flush\u201d the dead volume in the perfusion system before switching solutions.In the experiments described in Tsokas et al. (2016), two manual three-way valves in series allowed pre-flushing the dead volume in the tubing of the inflow mp6 micropump assemblies by switching the upstream three-way valve from the idle peristaltic pump (OFF) to the idle mp6 micropump (ON), and switching the downstream three-way valve so that the outflow from the micropump flows directly into waste (ON), rather than into the slice chamber (OFF). In this configuration, turning the micropump on for 10 seconds before switching it back off allows the dead volume to clear. Following this procedure, first turn the downstream valve\u2019s outlet to the waste to OFF, before turning the mp6 micropump back on to resume operation of the perfusion# system.WinLTP 2.30 has four perfusion line controls (Slow0, Slow1, Fast0, and Fast1) that can be used for controlling piezo steppers and pinch valves for automatic changing of bath perfusion. For an excellent discussion of how to use these features with commercially available pinch valve systems for automated pre-flush perfusion of slices, see Chapter 10 of the WinLTP 2.30 manual (Anderson, 2018).8.  The mp6 micropumps are sensitive and will be severely damaged if liquid is forced into them by applying pressure with a syringe. If the micropumps fail to draw liquid when initially turned on (usually due to incomplete purging of their contents during previous use), it is best to connect the inlet of the mp6 to proper tubing attached to the tip of a vertically positioned ^20ml syringe barrel (i.e., without the plunger, and with its tip pointed towards the ground). Turn the micropump on, pour a few mL of water into the barrel of the syringe, and allow gravity to assist the micropump\u2019s vibrating piezoelectric diaphragms in clearing the chambers of the pump.# Recipes1.  10x Stock Dissection ACSF Buffer (store at 4^\u00b0C ) (Table 1)Table 1.

Double cross-over recombination events were confirmed by PCR.Construction of racRS Complementation StrainTo complement the racRS mutant, the complementation plasmid pMA1\u20131261\u20131263 (van der Stel et al., 2015) was first transformed into E. coli S17 and then conjugated (Labigne-Roussel et al., 1987) to the racRS::Cm mutant strain.Purification of Recombinant RacR and Cytoplasmic RacSRacR (N-His) and RacScyto (N-His) were expressed and purified as described before (W\u00f6sten et al., 2004) using plasmids pT7.7-RacR(N-his) and pT7.7-RacScyto(N-his). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Construction of ggt Promoter Luciferase ConstructsTo localize where RacR binds on the ggt promoter, different lengths of the upstream region of the ggt gene were amplified by PCR. The PCRs were generated by fusion polymerase (Thermo) with Cj81116 genomic DNA as template and one of the primer pairs GGT28/GGT204, GGT28/GGT104, GGT28/GGT69, or GGT28/GGT35. The PCR products were digested with SacI and SphI (Thermo) and cloned into SacI, SphI digested plasmid pMA5-metK-luc (Bouwman et al., 2013) to replace the metK promoter. To obtain a promotorless luciferase vector, pMA5-metK-luc was digested with SacI and SphI, blunted with the blunting enzyme from the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo) and finally self-ligated. The plasmids were verified by sequencing (Macrogen). The obtained plasmids were transformed to E. coli S17 and subsequently conjugated to C. jejuni 81116 and the racRS mutant.Real-Time RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from late logarithmic phase C. jejuni cultures grown in HI medium at 42\u00b0C under oxygen limiting conditions with the addition of 50 mM nitrate, using RNA-BeeTM kit (Tel-Test, Inc) according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (van der Stel et al., 2015). Primers used in this assay are listed in Table 2. Experiments were repeated with three independently grown cultures. Fold increase was calculated with the 2\u0394\u0394Ct method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008) using rpoD as reference gene.GGT Activity AssayTo assay the GGT activity the production of 3-carboxy-4-nitroaniline was followed by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm according to a modified procedure described by (Chevalier et al., 1999). Briefly, 1 mL of bacterial culture was pelleted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for at least 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 250 \u03bcL buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 1 \u03bcg/mL lysozyme), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Next, the bacteria were disrupted by sonication followed by centrifugation (10 min at 12000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C). From the cell free bacterial lysate 20 \u03bcl was mixed together with 180 \u03bcl of a reagent containing 2.9 mM L-\u03b3-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide, 100 mM glycylglycine and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). Samples were measured every 60 s during an incubation period of 30 min at 37\u00b0C. From these graphs the slope of all values in a linear range was calculated. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). GGT activity is expressed as nmol min-1 mg protein-1. The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Luciferase AssayExpression of the luciferase in C. jejuni 81116 and racRS mutant strain harboring the pMA5-ggtprom-luc plasmids was measured as previously described (Bouwman et al., 2013). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted to an OD550 nm of 0.05 and grown for 7.5 h in HI with 50 mM KNO3 in an oxygen limiting atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. One milliliter of each culture was pelleted (8000 \u00d7g, 5 min, 4\u00b0C) and suspended in 100 \u03bcL RLB buffer (Promega) supplemented with 0.5% Triton-X100. Suspensions were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for at least 30 min to disrupt the bacteria. Bacterial lysate (20 \u03bcL) was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of luciferase reagent (Promega) and RLU\u2019s were measured immediately on a luminometer (TD20/20, Turner Designs). The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Gel Mobility Shift AssayThe promoter regions upstream of ggt, phoX (Cj0145), and Cj0200c were amplified by PCR using Dreamtaq polymerase (Thermo) and one of the primers sets GGTpromDIG/GGT204, GGTpromDIG/GGT104, GGTpromDIG/GGT69, GGTpromDIG/GGT35, Cj145F/CJ0145RDIG, and Cj200F/Cj200RDIG, respectively, (Table 2) and Cj81116 chromosomal DNA as template. Primers GGTpromDIG, Cj0145RDIG, and Cj200RDIG were ordered with a digoxigenin (DIG) label (Eurofins genomics). Approximately, 50 fmol DIG-labeled PCR fragments was incubated with His-tagged RacR, RacScyto, and 2 mM ATP for 30 min on ice. RacR, RacScyto, and ATP were preincubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C to allow phosphorylation. The binding buffer used for protein-DNA incubations was 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 100 \u03bcg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 \u03bcg/ml poly-(dI-dC) and 10% glycerol. Samples (10 \u03bcl) were run on a 4% non-denaturing Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel at 4\u00b0C. After electrophoresis the DNA was blotted on a hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham) and PCR fragments were visualized using \u03b1-DIG-AP, Fab fragments, and CSPD substrate (Roche).Growth CurvesCampylobacter jejuni precultures were grown for 7 h in HI medium with the addition of 50 mM nitrate at oxygen limiting conditions at 42\u00b0C. The precultures were diluted 50 times in 300 \u03bcL DMEM (without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate, bicarbonate, and phenol red, D5030, Sigma) with the addition of 10 mM TMAO and 10 mM glutamate, glutamine or aspartate, and growth curves were generated at 42\u00b0C in a 100 well honeycomb plate which was continuously shaking in a Bioscreen C MRB (Oy Growth Curves Ab) computer-controlled incubator. The incubator was placed inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Labs, Grass Lake, MI, USA), due to suboptimal gas exchange in the honeycomb plate the oxygen concentration was set to 1%, which yielded comparable growth as when bacteria were grown in rectangular flasks inside an anaerobic jar containing 0.3% O2. The OD600nm of cultures was recorded every 15 min during 45 h. For clarity reasons only point at 2.5 h, or 5 h intervals are shown. Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate.Statistical AnalysisPrism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed with Bonferroni post hoc tests; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Measurement of Acid Ecto-phosphatase Activity in Live Leishmania donovani Parasites", "keywords": " Ecto-enzymes, Acid ecto-phosphatases, Enzymatic assay in live cells, Leishmania sp, phosphatase activity, Tartate sensitivity", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3384", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Leishmania Promastigote Axenic Culture"}, "1.1": {"title": "Thawing and Initial Culture"}, "1.1.1": "Thaw the cells quickly by immersing the vial in a beaker with water at 25\u00b0C.", "1.1.2": "Transfer the cells with a sterile 1 ml pipette into a falcon tube with 9 ml culture medium (RPMI 1640-GlutaMax, supplemented with 10% (v/v) hiFBS, 40 mM HEPES, and antibiotics).", "1.1.3": "Resuspend and centrifuge at 1000\u00d7g for 7 min at RT.", "1.2": {"title": "Culture Maintenance"}, "1.2.1": "Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 10 ml culture medium.", "1.2.2": "Transfer into a 25 cm^2 flask and close the cap (without filter).", "1.2.3": "Culture at 25\u00b0C in the absence of CO2.", "1.3": {"title": "Parasite Subculturing and Harvesting"}, "1.3.1": "Perform parasite subculturing at 10^6 parasites/ml.", "1.3.2": "Harvest parasites by centrifugation (1000\u00d7g, 7 min at RT).", "1.4": {"title": "Culture Conditions for L. tarentolae Promastigotes"}, "1.4.1": "Culture L. tarentolae promastigotes at 25\u00b0C in Brain Heart Infusion (Lexsy Broth BHI) medium supplemented with hemin (5 \u03bcM) at a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v), 10 \u03bcM L-biopterin, and penicillin-streptomycin (1\u00d7).", "1.5": {"title": "Genetically Modified Parasites Culture"}, "1.5.1": "Culture genetically modified parasites in similar conditions with the parental strains but with the addition of Nourseothricin (100 \u03bcg/ml) when the genetic modification was performed with plasmids based on the pLEXSY-sat2 vector.", "1.6": {"title": "Parasite Maintenance"}, "1.6.1": "Subculture L. donovani strains (10^7 cells) once a week by removing 9 ml of the old culture and complementing with 9 ml of fresh medium (1/10 dilution).", "1.7": {"title": "Cell Counting"}, "1.7.1": "Remove a small volume of the culture (100 \u03bcl) for counting the cells with a hemocytometer (Malassez).", "1.7.2": "Transfer the sample into an Eppendorf tube containing 900 \u03bcl 2% (w/v) formalin at RT.", "1.7.3": "Wait for 2-3 min.", "1.7.4": "Take 100 \u03bcl and place in one chamber of the hemocytometer.", "1.7.5": "Observe under the microscope with a 40\u00d7 magnification lens.", "1.7.6": "Count the cells in several or all the large squares (each square has an area of 0.05 mm^2 and 0.2 mm depth representing a volume of 0.01 mm^3 = 10^-5 ml).", "1.7.7": "Divide the number of cells counted by the number of squares observed and multiply by 10^5/ml.

If the parasite culture is less dense, dilute in a smaller volume of formalin before counting.B. Protocol of assaying acid ecto-phosphatase in live Leishmania promastigotesThe acid ecto-phosphatase activity at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes, is assayed at 25~^\u00b0C or 37^\u00b0C for 30 min with the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) ( 10m M) in a 90~m M citrate buffer at p H4.8 (Sigma-Aldrich), with or without sodium tartrate (5 mM ,L(+) tartaric acid; Merck). Hydrolysis of the esteric bond and dephosphorylation of p N P P produces the p -nitro-phenol compound which after terminating the reaction by the addition of 0.5N N a O H is quantified by measuring its absorbance at 405n m (Figure 2).()(p-nitro-pnenol)Figure 2. Diagram of the enzymatic reaction of dephosphorylation of the pNPP substrate. The acid ecto-phosphatase reaction at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes can be carried out either at the logarithmic phase of growth (48-72 h post inoculation of the culture) or at the static phase of growth ( ^6^th or 7^th day post-inoculation).1. Harvest Leishmania promastigotes (1-2\u00d710^7) by centrifugation (1,000\u00d7 g,7min,R T)2. Resuspend the cell pellet with 5 ml 100 mM HEPES solution and wash twice with the same buffer.3. Count cells (as in step 11, A) and assess cell viability by visual inspection under the microscope of the parasite motility (dispense 50~ul of cell suspension on a microscope slide and observe with a 4\u00d7 lens) and quantitation by staining with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue (i.e., as in Trypan Blue Staining protocol). Counting and cell viability could be performed simultaneously.4. Centrifuge the large volume of the cell suspension (1,000\u00d7 g,7m i n) .5. Discard the supernatant (S/N).6. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500~ul reaction solution containing the phosphatase substrate pnitrophenyl phosphate ( 10m MpN P P in a 90m M citrate buffer, p H4.8. , with or without sodium tartrate 5 mM L(+). -tartaric acid prewarmed in the appropriate temperature of the reaction (25 ^\u00b0 or at 37 ^\u00b0C_. ).7. Incubate cells in the reaction mixture at 25~^\u00b0C or 37~^\u00b0C for 30m i n .8. Terminate the reaction by the addition of 0.5 N NaOH ( 1 ml/ sample).9. Remove the parasites by centrifugation (2,000\u00d7 g,5m i n) .10. Transfer the S/N in a plastic cuvette for spectrophotometric analysis.11. Measure the absorbance of the reaction product ( p -nitrophenolate =pN P ) at 405n m .12. Calculate the enzyme activity (A405 values) and normalize for the mean number of cells/ml for each independent experiment (A405/10^7c e l l s/m l) .13. Evaluate the acid phosphatase activity due to cell lysis under the reaction conditions as follows: a.

T-DNA alleles of fer-5 (SAIL_320_C11) and pod1-2 (SALK_049247) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Alonso et al. 2003). fer-5 plants were genotyped by PCR (40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0\u201420 s at 60 \u00b0C\u20141 min 72\u00b0 with an initial 5 min at 95 \u00b0C and a final step of 5 min at 72 \u00b0C) using primers fer-5_LP: 5\u2032-GTATGTGACTCGTCTCATGCG-3\u2032 and fer-5_RP: 5\u2032-AAGAGAGAGACGGAATCGTCC-3\u2032 to detect the wild-type allele (1.2-kb product) and SAIL-LB2: 5\u2032-GCTTCCTATTATATCTTCCCAAATTACCAATACA-3\u2032 and fer-5_RP to detect the mutant allele (0.7 kb), respectively. Q0990\u226berGFP enhancer trap (C24 ecotype) is derived from the Jim Haselhof collection (http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/Haseloff/Home.html) and has been described before (Levesque et al. 2006; Weijers et al. 2006). Similarly, pDR5rev::mRFPer (Gallavotti et al. 2008) and pNTA\u226bNLS-tdtomato (Kong et al. 2015) constructs and transgenic lines have been described before.The three-color pollen marker was obtained by crossing individual transgenic lines carrying pMGH3::MGH3-2xVenus-N7, pHTR12::HTR12-mCherry and pLAT52::ER-2xCFP in qrt1-4-/- background.Plasmid constructionTo generate pMGH3::MGH3-YFP, the MGH3 genomic coding sequence without stop codon including 1.24-kb promoter sequence was PCR amplified using primers 5\u2032-TTTTTGTCGACGAATTCATCGCTTCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTTGGATCCAGCACGTTCCCCACGAATGC-3\u2032. The PCR product was then cloned in-frame as SalI/BamHI fragment in pGreen II nos::bar containing 2xVenus-YFP-N7 followed by the ocs terminator. The pHTR12::HTR12-mCherry construct was obtained by PCR amplification of the HTR12 genomic coding sequence including 0.95-kb upstream sequence using the primers 5\u2032-TTTTTCTCGAGACTTGCTACTTTGTTGAAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTTGGATCCCCATGGTCTGCCTTTTCCTCCAA-3\u2032. The PCR product was cut with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into pGreen II nos::kan containing a mCherry coding sequence followed by the ocs terminator. pLAT52::ER-2xCFP was constructed by PCR amplification of the LAT52 promoter sequence using primers 5\u2032-TTTTTGGCGCGCCTCGACATACTCGACTCAGAAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTTATTTAAATCCTAGGCATAAACACACAAATTGT-3\u2032. The PCR product was then transferred into pBluescript containing 2xCFP-HDEL followed by the nos terminator. The pLAT52::ER-2xCFP cassette was then transferred to pGreen II nos::bar.Staining protocolSR staining solution, containing 0.1 % (v/v) SR2200 (Renaissance Chemicals; stock solution of the supplier was considered as 100 %), 1 % (v/v) DMSO (Carl-Roth, Cat.#7029.2), 0.05 % (w/v) Triton-X100, 5 % (w/v) glycerol (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#G5516) and 4 % (w/v) para-formaldehyde (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#6148) in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) was prepared freshly prior to use.For imaging of developing embryos, immature seeds were collected in staining solution on a microscope slide and embryos were gently squeezed out of the ovule by applying pressure on a cover slip. Images of embryos were taken within 30 min after release from the ovules. For images of whole ovules and PTs, ovules were manually dissected out of the silique and collected in a drop of staining solution on a microscope slide. For better tissue penetration, soft vacuum was applied for 5 min at RT. Afterward, the staining solution was replaced by water and again incubated under soft vacuum for 5 min. After replacing the water with 10 % glycerol, the sample was mounted under a coverslip. After squeezing out of the ovule, torpedo stage embryos were processed in a similar fashion as whole ovules.MicroscopyImages were obtained with Olympus FV1000, Leica SP8 and Zeiss LSM780NLO confocal microscopes. SR2200 was excited with a 405-nm laser line and emission recorded between 415 and 476 nm (405/415\u2013476); similar settings were used to detect DAPI. For fluorescent proteins, the following excitation/emission wavelengths were used: CFP (458/473\u2013552), GFP (488/505\u2013540), YFP (514/517\u2013597), dsRed variants (561/565\u2013615). For spectral unmixing of SR2200 and DAPI, images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM780NLO confocal microscopes equipped with a 32-channel GaAsP array for spectral detection (405/410\u2013695) and processed with Zeiss ZEN software. Individual staining of Arabidopsis ovules with only SR2200 or DAPI, respectively, was performed to obtain reference spectra. 3D reconstructions and orthogonal sections were produced with ImageJ software.SpectroscopyEmission spectra of SR2200 and DAPI were recorded between 370 and 650 nm using a Jasco 6500 fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Samples were dissolved in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7. SR2200 (2 \u00b5l/ml) was measured in complex with pectin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.# P9135), DAPI in complex with Salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Scientific; 100 mg/ml)."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Biofilm Assays on Fibrinogen-coated Silicone Catheters and 96-well Polystyrene Plates", "keywords": " Biofilm, Urine, Infection, Enterococcus faecalis, Fibrinogen, CAUTI, Catheter Background Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of nosocomial infections, most notably infective endocarditis (IE) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) (Arias et al., 2012; Chirouze et al., 2013; Flores-Mireles et al., 2015).

Bacterial growth1.  Streak the bacterial species on a BHI agar plate using a sterile inoculation loop.2.  Incubate bacteria overnight at 37^\u00b0C .3.  Add 10ml of BHI media into a 15ml conical tube.4.  Using a sterile inoculation loop, pick a single E. faecalis colony to inoculate the media.5.  Incubate the bacterial culture for 18h at 37^\u00b0C under static conditions (target O D_600=1.0) .B.  Catheter and microplate preparation# Catheter1.  Cut the silicone tubing in 1 cm pieces.2.  Cut in half the 1 cm pieces (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Preparation of 1 cm silicone pieces. A. Silicone tubing. B. 1 cm silicone pieces. C.1 cm pieces in half.3.  Put the resulting pieces in an open Petri dish.4.  UV-sterilize the pieces overnight (Biological Safety Cabinet standard UV settings)5.  Use sterile forceps to transfer each silicone piece into sterile 5ml glass test tube and cap it. Note: Fibrinogen is a sticky protein. Therefore use of a glass tube will reduce binding of fibrinogen to the tube walls.6.  Thaw the fibrinogen stock solution at 37^\u00b0C , and bring the 1x PBS solution to 37^\u00b0C . Fibrinogen is soluble at body temperature; therefore, keep it at 37^\u00b0C until you add it to the silicone pieces.7.  Prepare a working solution of 100u/ml of fibrinogen in 1x PBS.8.  Add 1 ml of the fibrinogen solution to the test tube containing the silicone piece.9.  Incubate the silicone pieces at 4^\u00b0C overnight under static conditions to allow fibrinogen to coat the catheter.# Microplate10. Dispense 100ul of the 100 u/m l fibrinogen solution (Step B7) into each well of the  96-well polystyrene plates (Grenier Bio-One CellSTAR).11. Seal the plate with a sterile plate sealing tape.12. Incubate the microplate at 4^\u00b0C overnight to allow fibrinogen to coat the bottom of the well.C.  Culture preparation1.

Infected cells were selected by treatment with 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin.For HIF\u20101\u03b1 overexpression in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells, retroviral particles were produced by co\u2010transfection of recombinant shuttle vector pCL\u2010Eco and pBABE vectors (pBABE\u2010puro, HA\u2010HIF1\u03b1\u2010wt\u2010pBABE, HA\u2010HIF1\u03b1\u2010P402A/P564A\u2010pBABE).Generation of MCU \u2212/\u2212 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell linesTo generate MCU \u2212/\u2212 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell lines, two Cas9 guides targeting different regions of the human MCU gene were designed (TGGCGGCTGACGCCCAGCCC for clone1 and GATCGCTTCCTGGCAGAATT for clone2) and cloned into the BsmBI site of the LentiCrisprV2 plasmid, a kind gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #52961). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were infected with lentiviral particles produced as described above and selected with puromycin for one week. Dilution cloning was performed to obtain different monoclonal cell populations that were screened and validated for MCU gene ablation by Western blot. LentiCrisprV2 plasmid was used to produce control clones.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used: anti\u2010MCU (1:1,000, HPA016480, Sigma\u2010Aldrich), anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010tubulin (1:5,000, sc9104, Santa Cruz), anti\u2010HIF\u20101\u03b1 (1:500, 610958, Becton Dickinson), and anti\u2010hydroxy\u2010HIF\u20101\u03b1 (1:1,000, 3434, Cell Signaling).Ca2+ measurementsFor measurements of [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit, cells grown on 12\u2010mm round glass coverslips were infected with cytosolic (Ad\u2010cytAEQ) or low\u2010affinity mitochondrial (Ad\u2010mtAEQmut) probes, as described (Bonora et al, 2013). Forty\u2010eight hours later, cells were incubated with 5 \u03bcM coelenterazine for 2 h in Krebs\u2010Ringer modified buffer (KRB) (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na3PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) at 37\u00b0C supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, and transferred to the perfusion chamber, and Ca2+ transients were evoked by agonist treatments. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB, and agonists were added to the same medium.For SOCC activity measurements, cells grown on 12\u2010mm round glass coverslips were infected with Ad\u2010cytAEQ. Forty\u2010eight hours later cells were incubated with coelenterazine, as described above, and transferred to the perfusion chamber. After 1 min of perfusion with 100 \u03bcM EGTA in KRB, agonists and other drugs were added for 2 min, in order to empty intracellular Ca2+ stores. Next, cells were perfused with KRB containing 2 mM Ca2+ together with agonist or drugs, as indicated.All aequorin experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 \u03bcM digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+\u2010rich solution (10 mM CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as previously described (Bonora et al, 2013).For measurements of resting mitochondrial [Ca2+], cells were grown on 24\u2010mm coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding 4mtGCaMP6f. After 24 h, coverslips were placed in 1 ml of KRB and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 40\u00d7/1.4 N.A. PlanFluar objective. Excitation was performed with a DeltaRAM V high\u2010speed monochromator (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp. Images were captured with a high\u2010sensitivity Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD (Photometrics). The system is controlled by MetaFluor 7.5 (Molecular Devices) and was assembled by Crisel Instruments. In order to perform quantitative measurements, we took advantage of the isosbestic point in the GCaMP6f excitation spectrum: we experimentally determined in living cells that exciting GCaMP6f at 410 nm leads to fluorescence emission, which is not Ca2+ dependent. As a consequence, the ratio between 474\u2010nm and 410\u2010nm excitation wavelengths is proportional to [Ca2+] while independent of probe expression (Hill et al, 2014). Cells were thus alternatively illuminated at 474 and 410 nm, and fluorescence was collected through a 515/30\u2010nm band\u2010pass filter (Semrock). Exposure time was set to 200 ms at 474 nm and to 400 ms at 410 nm, in order to account for the low quantum yield at the latter wavelength. At least 15 fields were collected per coverslip, and each field was acquired for 10 s (1 frame/s). Analysis was performed with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al, 2012). Both images were background corrected frame by frame by subtracting mean pixel values of a cell\u2010free region of interest. Data are presented as the mean of the averaged ratio of all time points.Mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03a8) measurementsCells were incubated with 20 nM tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester dye (TMRM) (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. TMRM fluorescence was measured by FACS. The probe was excited at 560 nm, and the emission light was recorded in the 590\u2013650 nm range; 10 \u03bcM FCCP (carbonyl cyanide\u2010p\u2010trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was added after 12 acquisitions to completely collapse the \u2206\u03a8. Data are expressed as difference of TMRM fluorescence before and after FCCP depolarization.Measurements of NADH/NADPH levels and redox stateFor fluorescence lifetime measurements, cells were plated onto 22\u2010mm glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight before imaging. At the microscope, coverslips were held at 37\u00b0C in a metal ring and bathed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) containing 25 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, buffered by 10 mM HEPES; 720\u2010nm two\u2010photon excitation from a Chameleon (Coherent) Ti:sapphire laser was directed through an upright LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 1.0 NA 40\u00d7 water\u2010dipping objective. A 650\u2010nm short\u2010pass dichroic and 460 \u00b1 25 nm emission filter separated NAD(P)H fluorescence from the incident illumination. On\u2010sample powers were kept below 10 mW, and emission events were registered by an external detector (HPM\u2010100, Becker & Hickl) attached to a commercial time\u2010correlated single\u2010photon counting electronics module (SPC\u2010830, Becker & Hickl). Scanning was performed continuously for 2 min with a pixel dwell time of 1.6 \u03bcs. Subsequent NAD(P)H FLIM data analysis was performed using the procedures detailed in Blacker et al (2014).For measuring NAD(P)H redox state, cells were plated as described above and imaged using a Zeiss 510 META UV\u2010VIS confocal microscope. The blue autofluorescence emitted by the pyridine nucleotides NADH and NADPH in their reduced form was excited with a UV laser (Coherent; at 351 nm), and emission was collected using a 435\u2010nm to 485\u2010nm band\u2010pass filter. To measure the dynamic range of the signal in relation to the fully reduced and oxidized NAD(P)H pool, cells were exposed to carbonyl cyanide 4\u2010(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP [1 \u03bcM] to stimulate respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H oxidation) and rotenone ([5 \u03bcM] to inhibit respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H reduction). The final formula used to normalize the NAD(P)H autofluorescence measurements was (F \u2212 FFCCP)/(Frotenone \u2212 F). Quantitative analysis of the images obtained was done using the ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).ROS production measurementsTo determine mitochondrial superoxide levels, cells were loaded with 2 mM MitoSOX\u2122 Red reagent (Life Technologies) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Images were taken on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200) equipped with a PlanFluar 60\u00d7/1.4 NA objective, a Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD, and a 75 W Xenon arc lamp coupled to a monochromator (PTI Deltaram V). The system was assembled by Crisel Instruments. MitoSOX\u2122 Red excitation was performed at ~510 nm, and emission was collected at 580 nm. Maximal ROS production was induced with 2.5 \u03bcM Antimycin\u2010A (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). Images were taken every 10 s with a fixed 200 ms exposure time. Data were analyzed by ImageJ software.To determine GSSG/GSH and H2O2 levels, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HyperRed, pLPCXmitGrx1\u2010roGFP2, and pHyPer\u2010dMito. To measure mitochondrial pH, SypHer2 plasmid was used. SypHer2 originates from a mutation in a cysteine residue of HyPer that renders it insensitive to H2O2 but does not affect the pH sensitivity. Images were acquired every 5 s using a Cell Observer High Speed (Zeiss) microscope equipped with 40\u00d7 oil Fluar (N.A. 1.3) objective, CFP (Semrock HC), YFP and RFP (Zeiss) single\u2010band filters, 420 and 505 nm LED's (Colibri, Zeiss), and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Maximal ROS production was induced with 100 \u03bcM H2O2. To calculate fluorescence ratios, background intensity was subtracted and images were corrected for linear crosstalk. pHyPer\u2010dMito and pLPCXmitGrx1\u2010roGFP2 ratios were calculated by AxioVision software (Zeiss) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft). HyperRed fluorescence was analyzed by ImageJ software.Cell death and cell cycle detectionCell cycle and cell death induction after MCU silencing were measured by cytofluorometry. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were identified by labeling with FITC\u2010Annexin V (Roche) and propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and analyzing cells by FACS (FACS Canto II, BD BioSciences). Data were processed using the BD Vista software.Wound healing migration assayFor wound healing assays, cells were seeded at low confluency (30%) in 6\u2010well plates, transfected with siRNA, and cultured in medium without serum. The day after, a linear scratch was obtained on cell monolayers through a vertically held P200 tip and medium was replaced. Images were taken at the indicated time points (time 0 as reference). \u201cTScratch\u201d software (www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/software/) was used for automated image analysis.Clonogenic assayTo evaluate clonogenic potential, transduced cells were counted and seeded (102 cells/cm2). Colonies were counted 7 days later. Only, colonies containing \u2265 30 cells were counted.ATP production measurementsATP production was measured with the ATPlite 1 step Luminescence Assay System (PerkinElmer) according to manufacturer's instructions. Glycolysis was inhibited by treatment with 5.5 mM 2\u2010deoxy\u2010D\u2010glucose for 1 h.Spheroids formation assay15 \u00d7 102 cells/cm2 were seeded in a 96\u2010well plate containing 100 \u03bcl of 1.5% agar in PBS. Seventy\u2010two hours later, spheroids were harvested and collected in tubes filled with 1 ml of medium. Each tube contained five spheroids. Spheroids were let settle to the bottom of the tube, and medium was then sucked out. Spheroids were resuspended in 400 \u03bcl/well of a collagen mix solution (1.66 mM l\u2010glutamine, 10% FBS, 0.213% NaHCO3, 1% Pen/Strep, 2 mg/ml Collagen I Bovine Protein (Life Technologies) in MEM (Life Technologies)) and seeded in a 24\u2010well plate, previously filled with 300 \u03bcl/well of collagen mix solution. After collagen mix solidification, 1 ml of medium was added in each well. Images were collected every day, for 3 days, and the area of the spheroid cluster was analyzed by Fiji ImageJ software (time 0 as reference).RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative real\u2010time PCRRNA was extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was generated with a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) and analyzed by real\u2010time PCR (Bio\u2010Rad). HPRT\u20101 and GAPDH were used as housekeeping genes. The following primers were used: HIF\u20101\u03b1: FOR: TGTACCCTAACTAGCCGAGGAA_ REV: AATCAGCACCAAGCAGGTCATA HIF\u20102\u03b1: FOR: AATGCAGTACCCAGACGGATTT_ REV: ATGTTTGTCATGGCACTGAAGC LOX: FOR: TCAGATTTCTTACCCAGCCGAC_ REV: TTGGCATCAAGCAGGTCATAGT PDK1: FOR: AATGCAAAATCACCAGGACAGC_ REV: ATTACCCAGCGTGACATGAACT G6PI: FOR: TTACTCCAAGAACCTGGTGACG_ REV: CTACCAGGATGGGTGTGTTTGA CAIX: FOR: TGGCTGCTGGTGACATCCTA_ REV: TTGGTTCCCCTTCTGTGCTG HK2: FOR: GTGCCCGCCAGAAGACATTA_ REV: TGCTCAGACCTCGCTCCATT HPRT\u20101: FOR: TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA_ REV: GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT GAPDH: FOR: GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC_ REV: CCCCACTTGATTTTGGAGGGAT In vivo tumor assaysOne control and two independent MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 MCU \u2212/\u2212 clones were transduced with a lentiviral vector coding for the Firefly Luciferase reporter gene (Breckpot et al, 2003).For orthotopic tumor assay, 106 cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl DMEM and injected in the fat pad of six\u2010week\u2010old female SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). The volume of tumor mass was measured by calipering at specific time points. In vivo imaging was performed at the day of sacrifice (day 39 post\u2010injection for control, day 46 p.i. for MCU \u2212/\u2212 clone1, and day 56 p.i. for MCU \u2212/\u2212 clone2). D\u2010Luciferin (Biosynth AG) (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. to anesthetized animals. The light emitted from the bioluminescent tumors or metastasis was detected using a cooled charge\u2010coupled device camera mounted on a light\u2010tight specimen box (IVIS Lumina II Imaging System; Caliper Life Sciences). Regions of interest from displayed images were identified around metastatic regions, such as lymph nodes and lungs, and were quantified as total photon counts or photon/s using Living Image\u00ae software (Xenogen). In some experiments, the lower portion of each animal was shielded before reimaging in order to minimize the bioluminescence from primary tumor. For ex vivo imaging, D\u2010Luciferin (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. immediately before necropsy. The lungs were excised, placed in a Petri plate, and imaged for 5 min. Animals were randomized before experiments, and no blinding was done. Procedures involving animals and their care were in accordance with the Italian law D. L.vo no 26/2014, and the experimental protocol (Authorization n. 8584/2012\u2010PR) was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.Bioinformatics analysisTo evaluate the correlation of the expression of MCU complex components with tumor progression, median\u2010centered log2 mRNA expression levels of MCUa (NM_138357.2), MCUb (CCDC109b, NM_017918.4), MICU1 (NM_006077.3), MICU2 (NM_152726.2), MICU3 (NM_181723.2), and EMRE (SMDT1, NM_033318.4) were compiled from the TCGA breast cancer dataset (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/brca_2012/) (Koboldt et al, 2012). Linear regression analysis of individual expression values with the corresponding tumor size (T1\u2013T4) and lymph node (N0\u2013N3) stages was done in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc.).To quantify correlation of MCU mRNA levels with HIF\u20101\u03b1 and a HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated gene set, linear models have been constructed in R, and prediction values were analyzed against MCU expression levels using linear regression analysis (GraphPad). The HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated gene set was compiled from the Broad Institute GSEA database (merged sets of V$HIF1_Q3 and V$HIF1_Q5, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/cards/V$HIF1_Q5.html).Constructing linear models to predict correlations between MCU and HIF\u20101\u03b1 and a HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated gene setTo test whether the expression of members of the MCU complex was predictive of HIF\u20101\u03b1 expression, two linear models were created. One to predict the expression of HIF\u20101\u03b1 from members of the MCU complex and the other to predict the average expression of HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated genes. Both linear models were found to be highly statistically significant (P\u2010values 5.67e\u201012 for predicting HIF\u20101\u03b1 and 2.48e\u201022 for predicting HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated genes), but these models predict only a relatively small amount of the variation in the data with adjusted R 2 values of 0.1099 and 0.1927, respectively. In both models, some members of the MCU complex were found to be more predictive than others. For instance, for predicting the expression of HIF\u20101\u03b1, MCU is the most predictive with a P\u2010value of the expression of MCU not being relevant for predicting HIF\u20101\u03b1 was 3.83e\u201006, while for predicting the average of HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated genes, expression of MICU2 was most significant with a P\u2010value of 4.57e\u201012. Output from R and detailed explanation can be found at http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html. The full set of results is summarized in the tables below:Linear model of MCU predicting HIF\u20101\u03b1 expression Linear model of MCU complex predicting HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010regulated gene expression StatisticsFor bioinformatics data, statistical analyses are reported above.For in vitro and in vivo experiments, statistical analyses were performed using Student's two\u2010tailed non\u2010paired t\u2010tests. P\u2010values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and marked with asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001), as indicated in the figure legends. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD if not indicated otherwise. Statistical tests applied are indicated in the figure legends.Sample size determinationFisher's exact test has been applied to determine the probability of detecting differences in the following end points: In vivo studies: a total number of nine mice for each experimental condition were analyzed in order to detect the expected variation in terms of probability of tumor growth and metastasis formation between treatment conditions, with statistical power of 0.85 and assuming a significance threshold corresponding to P < 0.05. A priori sample size determinations were performed by the GPower3.1 (www.gpower.hhu.de/) software tool and by a simulation based approach. In vitro studies: data available in our laboratory to define the variance of the results were adopted. We have assumed a statistical power of 85% and a significance level of P < 0.05 applying the Bonferroni correction whenever required."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Live Confocal Imaging of Brachypodium

In general, we try to accelerate the transition to flowering while still maintaining a healthy plant with several lateral branches. Using a ^20h light/4 h dark cycle and small pot sizes stimulates flowering, but in these conditions proper watering is important. Larger pot sizes and shorter day lengths will lengthen the time to flowering, but may yield more spikelets for imaging per plant.Plants can be grown at higher densities if they are only used for harvesting spikelets. If plants are grown for seeds, a lower planting density or culling before flowering is recommended. See the Materials and Reagents section for pot sizes and soil recommendations. Below you will find general growth guidelines.1.  Seed preparation (optional) For some batches of seed, germination can be improved by removing the lemma. The lemma is the outer leaf-like organ with a long protruding tendril-like mid-vein called the awn (Figure 3E). Peel off the lemma by gripping the awn and opening away from the seed.2.  SowingEnsure soil is well watered before sowing. Place 2 seeds per pot to ensure adequate germination. Plants will need to be culled down to 1 per pot if they are being grown for seed. Sow by pushing the seed vertically just below the soil surface with the awn end facing up.3.  Stratification (optional)After sowing place trays at 4^\u00b0C for 2-4 days to synchronize germination.4.  Growth Conditions20 h 300 umol light, 4h dark.5.  GerminationEnsure trays are well watered before placing into the light, and cover with clear plastic lids until plants are germinated, up to one week.6.  FertilizationInclude fertilizer with every second watering according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Watering before floweringWatering is performed by pouring 1 cm of water into the bottom of each tray.Note: It is critical that young plants never sit in standing water for long periods of time, especially during the first 2-3 weeks of growth. If plants do not soak up the added water in the bottom of the tray after ~20 min it should be drained by pouring out. Use the weight of the tray to determine watering. In general, water sparingly during the first few weeks to stimulate root growth. Plants that are overwatered early will not have a well-developed root system and will suffer during flowering.# bio-protocol# 8.  Watering during flowering and seed setAfter flowering and especially during seed-set, plants will need plenty of water. After the first addition of water, allow plants to soak for 15-20 min before adding a small amount of additional water. At this stage, plants can sit in a small amount of water to ensure they do not dry out (e.g., over the weekend). Maintaining adequate watering late in development is critical to seed set. Watering can be cut off at the first sign of senescence (brown/yellowing starting in the inflorescence) to accelerate seed drying. Alternatively, watering can be extended during most of senescence to increase seed yield.# B.  StagingProper staging will ensure consistent results and facilitate dissection. In our growth conditions, Brachypodium has three main branching axes at floral transition. The central apical branch will generally flower first, and it is this branch that we focus on to harvest spikelet meristems. Upon the transition to flowering the apical meristem will first initiate several lateral spikelet (LS) meristems before transitioning into the terminal spikelet (TS) meristem (Figure 2A) (Derbyshire and Byrne, 2013; O'Connor et al., 2014). The terminal spikelet will mature first, followed by the lateral spikelets proceeding from the top of the inflorescence basally.Each spikelet meristem initiates two sterile leaf-like glumes (GL) before initiating florets in a distichous phyllotaxy ( 180^\u00b0 between each organ) (Figure 2A). The first organ in each floret is the lemma (L), a leaf-like organ that subtends the floral meristem (FM) and will cover the seed at maturity (Figure 2B). At the tip of each lemma mid-vein is a long tendril called the awn (AW) (Figures 2A, 3E).()Figure 2. Brachypodium spikelet meristems. A. Maximum projection of Citrine (a YFP variant) tagged SoPIN1 auxin transport protein in the Brachypodium inflorescence. Normally with the# bio-protocolstaging method described in the text the terminal spikelet (TS) will not be exposed as in this image. The sterile glumes (GL), floral meristems (FM), lemmas (L), and awns (AW) of the terminal spikelet (TS) are labeled. The lateral spikelets (LS) are positioned perpendicular to the terminal spikelet and mature later. B. Maximum projection of SoPIN1 in a Brachypodium spikelet meristem. This side-on view is how we normally image. The youngest to oldest incipient lemma primordia are labeled I2 and I1, while youngest to oldest primordia are labeled P1, P2, and P3. The youngest floral meristem is also labeled (FM). C. The inflorescence can be turned 90 degrees to capture a view of the spikelet meristem where lemma primordia and the floral meristem are imaged end-on. In this maximum projection I1 convergent polarization of SoPIN1 (I1), the P2 lemma (P2), and the floral meristem (FM) are labeled. Scale bars =50~um in (A), 25um in (B) and (C).The key to staging is to identify branches where the floral transition has just occurred, but before the terminal spikelet fully emerges. This stage is easily identified because the awn of the terminal spikelet is visible emerging from the sheath of the last vegetative leaf (Figures 3B and 3C). At this stage the lateral spikelets will be immature and largely exposed. We have termed this stage the \"first-awn\" stage. The first-awn stage in the main axis occurs in our growth conditions starting approximately 3 weeks after moving plants to light, after the production of approximately 7 leaves. The earlier the first-awn stage is identified, the easier the lateral spikelets will be to dissect. It may be necessary to unroll the last vegetative leaf in order to see the first awn at the earliest stages (Figure 3B). Branches where the entire terminal spikelet has emerged from the last vegetative leaf (Figure 3D) are too old and are not suitable for harvesting spikelet meristems. At this late stage, the lateral spikelets are covered and tend to break off the main axis during dissection.We have not noticed significant differences between lateral and terminal spikelet meristems, but harvesting meristems from a consistent position is recommended.()Too young Perfect Last Chance Too old MatureFigure 3. Inflorescence staging. Stages of Brachypodium inflorescence development (A)-(E). A. Prior to the transition to flowering the inflorescence is not visible. B. The ideal stage for dissection is when the top of the terminal spikelet just emerges from the last vegetative leaf. The most identifying feature of the transition to flowering is the appearance of the awn, the tendril-like organ at the tip of each floret, clearly visible in panel E (labeled AW in B-E). Often the last vegetative leaf needs to be unrolled and opened slightly to reveal the terminal spikelet awn. Plants at this early \u201cfirst-awn\u201d stage are the easiest to dissect. C. The end of the ideal stage occurs when the terminal spikelet completely emerges from the last vegetative leaf. Panel C shows the very end of the permissible stage. Inset shows detail of the first awn of the terminal spikelet. D. Inflorescences where the terminal spikelet has fully emerged are not suitable for imaging. E. The mature Brachypodium inflorescence with the terminal spikelet (TS) and two lateral spikelets (LS). The mature lemmas (L) and awns (AW) are clearly visible at this stage.# C.  DissectionNote:a.  See Video 1 for a demonstration of the entire dissection procedure.b.  These steps should be completed as quickly as possible. The sample will dry out if the cut end is not embedded in agarose quickly. A damp paper towel can be placed on the stage of the dissection scope to delay sample drying. Recommended dissection tools are shown in Figure 1.1.  Identify branches at the \"first-awn\" stage (Figure 4A)2.  Remove the sample from the main plant by cutting just below the last visible node. Node tissue is generally white and is covered in a collar of trichomes, hereafter called the \"fuzzy collar\" (FC) (Figure 4A).3.  Release the internal tissues by cutting through the entire stem just above the fuzzy collar of the node (Figure 4B).4.  Gripping the base lightly with your fingers (do not crush), carefully pull the inner tissue out of the sheath tissue of the outer leaf.5.  Repeat until there is a single leaf surrounding the inflorescence. Usually, 2-3 leaves cover the immature inflorescence.()Video 1. Video of dissection and mounting of Brachypodium spikelet meristem. Video shows how to identify the first awn stage, dissect out the spikelet meristem sample, remove organs covering the meristem, and mount for confocal imaging.# bio-protocol6.  Once again, cut just above the fuzzy collar of the node (Figure 4C), carefully grip the leaf base with your fingers and pull out the inflorescence (Figure 4D).7.  Under the dissecting scope grip the sample by the terminal spikelet and select one of the lateral spikelets for dissection. Generally, the lowest lateral spikelet is the easiest to dissect.8.  Using a probe, syringe needle, or fine forceps start at the base of the spikelet and remove the immature bracts (Figure 4E) and any immature lemmas covering the spikelet meristem. Note: The immature bracts and lemmas wrap around the spikelet, so it is often easier to remove them if you insert the probe on the opposite side of the spikelet meristem from the midvein and unwrap. The organ will break at the base.9.  Remove immature organs until the spikelet meristem is visible (Figure 4F).10. For the last few lemmas that have not grown enough to cover the spikelet meristem, only the awns should be removed by gripping with forceps and bending away from the spikelet meristem apex until the awn breaks off. Note: If these awns are not removed a bubble will form around the spikelet meristem making staining and imaging under water impossible.11. The exposed spikelet meristem is now ready for optional staining or mounting (Figure 4G).()Figure 4. Dissection and mounting of spikelet meristems. A. First remove the sample by cutting below the fuzzy collar (FC) of the last visible node. B. Using micro-scissors or razorblade cut just above the fuzzy collar (FC) of the node to release the inner tissues. C. Once the# bio-protocolinner nodes are removed from the sheath by pulling out, repeat by carefully cutting just above the fuzzy collar (FC) of the next node. D. Repeat until the entire inflorescence is released by pulling on the end of the terminal spikelet (TS). The basal most lateral spikelets (arrows) are typically the easiest to dissect because they are less likely to break off, and the meristems are more exposed. E. Expose the meristem by removing the glume (GL) and lemma primordia wrapped around the spikelet meristem. F. Remove the remaining lemma awns (arrows) by carefully bending down and breaking off or by using the sharp end of a syringe needle to cut off. G. Once all lemmas and lemma awns are removed the meristem is fully exposed (arrow) and ready  for  mounting  or  optional  counterstaining.  H.  After  optional  counterstaining,  the inflorescence is trimmed and mounted in a Petri dish by adhering the ends with drops of 1% agarose. Immerse the sample in water to prevent drying and image immediately.# D.  Counterstains (optional)After dissection, samples can be counterstained by placing directly into a 1.5~ml microfuge tube containing the stain of choice (Figure 5A). Make sure a bubble does not surround the spikelet meristem and that it does not contact the side of the tube.We have successfully used propidium iodide to stain cell walls (Figures 5B and 5D, Propidium iodide: 10u/m l in water for 10-20 min ). Propidium iodide is normally excluded from the inside of the cell by the plasma membrane. Thus, damaged or dead cells will stain internally, especially in the nucleus, and damaged samples are easily identified.We also regularly use the vital stain FM4-64 to stain cell membranes and endocytic vesicles (Figure 5C, FM4-64 (Figure 5C): 50 u/m l in water for 5-15~m i n ). Short stain times (5-10 m i n) will mark only the cell membrane, while longer stain times will mark vesicles as the stain is endocytosed.()Figure 5. Counterstains. A.

Note the reduced staining of propidium iodide deep in the center of the spikelet (asterisk); this tissue is both hard to stain and image because of the thickness of the tissue. Lemma primordia are labeled from youngest to oldest I2, I1, P1, P2, P3. Floral meristems are labeled (FM). Scale bars =25 um in (B) and (C), 50um in (D).# E.  Mounting1.  Once the target spikelet meristem is revealed, you can cut off the other spikelets so the sample will lie flat in the dish. Note: Be sure to leave enough tissue at both ends to act as mounting points (Figure 4H).2.  Using molten 1% agarose and a Pasteur pipette, \"glue\" the two ends of the sample down in the center of a 5 cm Petri dish (Figure 4H).3.  Working quickly before the agarose solidifies, adjust the sample so the target meristem sits in the plane of the dish. This may involve twisting the main branch axes quite severely.4.  After the agarose completely solidifies cover with water and image immediately, do not allow the sample to dry out.# F.  ImagingImaging parameters will depend on the specific reporter, sample, confocal, objective, and other factors, but general recommendations are provided here.Most confocals will have settings to automatically optimize XY and Z resolutions. These are a good starting point, but these settings often oversample for most experiments and lead to long scan times and possible bleaching. For routine moderately-high resolution imaging, we use around 1024 \u00d71024 resolution and a field of view of 200um or less. Lower resolutions around 512\u00d7512 may be suitable for some experiments and will greatly increase the scanning speed. We recommend a bit depth of at least 12, especially if quantifying florescence. We generally use a zoom of approximately z x with a 20\u00d7 objective and a Z step-size of 0.5-3~um with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit, although these settings should be adjusted to the particular sample and experimental goal.Because the spikelet meristem is symmetrical, only one half of the depth needs to be imaged in order to get a good sense of a particular expression domain. The sample can be turned 90^\u00b0 , remounted with agarose and re-imaged to get a different view (Figures 2B and 2C). The relatively small size of the Brachypodium spikelet meristem means it is generally easy to image deep into the tissue. However, the fluorescent signal will decrease deeper into the tissue, especially at the base of the spikelet meristem (Figure 5D).\nGrowth\nIntroduction\nBrachypodium plants can be grown in a variety of soils, pots, temperatures, and light regimes.\nThe goal is to accelerate the transition to flowering while maintaining a healthy plant with several lateral branches.\nSeed Preparation\nFor some batches of seed, germination can be improved by removing the lemma.\nPeel off the lemma by gripping the awn and opening away from the seed.\nSowing\nEnsure soil is well watered before sowing.\nPlace 2 seeds per pot to ensure adequate germination.\nSow by pushing the seed vertically just below the soil surface with the awn end facing up.\nStratification\nAfter sowing, place trays at 4\u00b0C for 2-4 days to synchronize germination.\nGrowth Conditions\n20h 300 umol light, 4h dark.\nEnsure trays are well watered before placing into the light, and cover with clear plastic lids until plants are germinated, up to one week.\nFertilization\nInclude fertilizer with every second watering according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nWatering\nWatering is performed by pouring 1 cm of water into the bottom of each tray.\nNote: It is critical that young plants never sit in standing water for long periods of time, especially during the first 2-3 weeks of growth.\nStaging\nIntroduction\nProper staging will ensure consistent results and facilitate dissection.\nIn our growth conditions, Brachypodium has three main branching axes at floral transition.\nIdentifying the First-Awn Stage\nThe key to staging is to identify branches where the floral transition has just occurred, but before the terminal spikelet fully emerges.\nThis stage is easily identified because the awn of the terminal spikelet is visible emerging from the sheath of the last vegetative leaf.\nDissection\nIntroduction\nSee Video 1 for a demonstration of the entire dissection procedure.\nThese steps should be completed as quickly as possible.\nRemoving the Sample\nIdentify branches at the 'first-awn' stage.\nRemove the sample from the main plant by cutting just below the last visible node.\nReleasing Internal Tissues\nRelease the internal tissues by cutting through the entire stem just above the fuzzy collar of the node.\nGripping the base lightly with your fingers, carefully pull the inner tissue out of the sheath tissue of the outer leaf.\nExposing the Meristem\nRepeat the process until there is a single leaf surrounding the inflorescence.\nOnce again, cut just above the fuzzy collar of the node, carefully grip the leaf base with your fingers and pull out the inflorescence.\nDissecting the Spikelet Meristem\nUnder the dissecting scope, grip the sample by the terminal spikelet and select one of the lateral spikelets for dissection.\nUsing a probe, syringe needle, or fine forceps, start at the base of the spikelet and remove the immature bracts and any immature lemmas covering the spikelet meristem.\nCounterstains\nIntroduction\nAfter dissection, samples can be counterstained by placing directly into a 1.5ml microfuge tube containing the stain of choice.\nPropidium Iodide Staining\nPropidium iodide can be used to stain cell walls.\nPropidium iodide is normally excluded from the inside of the cell by the plasma membrane.\nFM4-64 Staining\nFM4-64 can be used to stain cell membranes and endocytic vesicles.\nShort stain times will mark only the cell membrane, while longer stain times will mark vesicles as the stain is endocytosed.\nMounting\nIntroduction\nOnce the target spikelet meristem is revealed, you can cut off the other spikelets so the sample will lie flat in the dish.\nMounting the Sample\nUsing molten 1% agarose and a Pasteur pipette, 'glue' the two ends of the sample down in the center of a 5cm Petri dish.\nWorking quickly before the agarose solidifies, adjust the sample so the target meristem sits in the plane of the dish.\nImaging\nIntroduction\nImaging parameters will depend on the specific reporter, sample, confocal, objective, and other factors.\nGeneral Recommendations\nMost confocals will have settings to automatically optimize XY and Z resolutions.\nFor routine moderately-high resolution imaging, we use around 1024 \u00d71024 resolution and a field of view of 200um or less."}, "consistency": {"doi_match": false, "title_sim": 0.0, "keyword_sim": 0.002, "action_overlap": 0.143, "material_overlap": 0.25, "param_coverage": 0.25, "section_list": ["Materials and Methods"], "sections_total_chars": 20151, "sections_total_tokens": 2847, "suspect_mismatch": false, "notes": ""}}

Specifically, 25 ml cultures were grown in round-bottom Pyrex tubes (20 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter). Cotton-plugged Pasteur pipette (23 cm long) inserted through a sponge-plug served for bubbling of 3% CO2 in air into the cultures. The tip of the Pasteur pipette was placed 1\u20132 cm above the bottom of the tube. Prior to bubbling into the culture, the gas was humidified by passing through a bottle with double distilled water and filtered using 0.22 \u03bcm filter. BG11 medium45 served for culturing; however, to reproducibly observe biofilm formation, it was important to add the ferric ammonium citrate and citric acid components (final concentrations 0.0226 and 0.0312 mM, respectively) from freshly made stocks. Autoclaved BG11 was used within 4 days to inoculate cultures. Cultures were grown at 30 \u00b0C and under incandescent light (20\u201330 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 sec\u22121).For assessment of biofilm formation, cells were cultured under continuous bubbling. Experiments were initiated by diluting cultures at the exponential phase of growth to an optical density at 750 nm of 0.5. Biofilm development under this setting typically initiated following 2\u20133 days of growth and quantification was performed after 7 days to allow assessment of fully developed biofilms (longer growth time did not increase biofilm development). Percentage of chlorophyll in suspended cells served to quantity biofilm formation as follows. The suspended fraction was sampled for chlorophyll determination by extraction in 80% acetone (final concentration). In cases were the suspended fraction appeared especially dense (planktonic strains or poor biofilm formers), a 0.2 mL sample was used for extraction. When robust biofilms were formed, 15 mL of planktonic cells were removed and concentrated 3 to 6-fold by centrifugation (5000 g, 10 min) prior the chlorophyll extraction in 80% acetone. Determination of chlorophyll in the biofilm was performed following removal of the planktonic cells using a pipette and addition of 80% acetone to the sessile cells. Extraction was carried out over-night in the refrigerator. Dilution in 80% acetone was performed to reach the linear range of the calibration curve and chlorophyll was quantified based on absorbance at 663 nm. For statistical analysis of comparisons of chlorophyll in suspension we employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post analysis multiple comparison contrasts (see statistical grouping in Figs 2 and 4 and Tables S1 and S3 for p-values).For collection of conditioned medium, cultures were centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed and passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. Supplementation with nutrients by addition of medium stock solutions as in the preparation of fresh growth medium was performed when the conditioned medium served for cyanobacterial growth.For microscopic analysis of biofilms, microscope slides were inserted into growth tubes containing T2SE\u2126 cultures (for 6 days) so that biofilms formed on the slides. A Leica TCS SPE DM2500 was employed for imaging by fluorescence microscopy using objective HCX APO l 40x/0.80 (excitation 532 nm, emission 620\u2013650 nm). 3D image reconstruction was performed using Imaris. Analysis by SEM was described previously33.Genetic manipulations of cyanobacterial cellsInsertional inactivation of genes Synpcc7942_2071 (t2sE), Synpcc7942_1134 (ebfG4), and Synpcc7942_1133 was described previously33. In the case of deletion of ebfG1 through ebfG4 (\u22064), disruption was obtained by deletion of the fragment between the NheI and ClaI sites. Resulting constructs were introduced into S. elongatus using standard transformation methods that take advantage of its natural competence46. Mutant cyanobacterial clones resistant to the appropriate antibiotic were confirmed for double homologous recombination (allele replacement) and complete chromosomal segregation using PCR on genomic DNA. Primers and additional cloning information are provided in Table S4. Inactivation of t2SE impaired the natural DNA competence of S. elongatus; thus, to obtain T2SE\u03a9 strains with additional genetic changes, we initially introduced the other genetic modifications and subsequently inactivated t2sE.Vectors used to introduce the WT and mutated complementation DNA fragments into NS1 were generated using the GeneArt\u00ae Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Life Technologies) on PCR-generated cloning fragments and standardized devices (a chloramphenicol resistance device and a NS1 device with tetracycline resistance) derived via ZraI or EcoRV-HF (New England Biolabs) restriction digestion of CYANO-VECTOR donor plasmids as described by Taton et al.47. To improve the efficiency of cloning, the 6-kb WT DNA fragment was constructed from two 3-kb fragments amplified with the Q5\u00ae High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). To introduce glycine- or cysteine to alanine mutations, the appropriate cloning fragment was assembled from subfragments; these segments were generated using seamless assembly cloning primers designed to introduce the appropriate base mutations at the center of the overlap between subfragments. Combining multiple such subfragments or generating subfragments from previously mutated vectors allowed the generation of the quadruple GG-mutation vector. The sequence of each vector was confirmed. These vectors were used to transform S. elongatus strains as described above. For additional information see Table S4 and Fig. S2.Mass spectrometry analysisConditioned medium was harvested as described above. Mass spectrometry was performed by the de Botton Institute for Protein Profiling at The Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalized Medicine (Weizmann Institute of Science).Sample preparationCulture supernatants were concentrated ~20 fold on 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff-filters. Proteins were reduced by incubation with dithiothreitol (5 mM; Sigma) for 45 min at 60 \u00b0C, and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark for 45 min at 21 \u00b0C. Proteins were then subjected to digestion with trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI, USA, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C followed by digestion with chymotrypsin (Sigma, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C. The digestions were stopped by trifluroacetic acid (1%). Following digestion, peptides were desalted using solid-phase extraction columns (Oasis HLB, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The samples were stored in \u221280 \u00b0C until further analysis.Liquid chromatographyULC/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi nanoAcquity; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase C18 trapping column (180 \u03bcm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 \u03bcm particle size; Waters). The peptides were then separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 \u03bcm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 \u03bcm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 \u03bcL/min. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 4% to 30% B in A (vol/vol) in 105 min, 35% to 90% B in A in 5 min, maintained at 95% for 5 min and then back to initial conditions.Mass SpectrometryThe nano Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 \u03bcm tip; New Objective; Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon). For initial identification, data were acquired in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top20 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time was set to 20 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500 and maximum injection time of 60 msec. For targeted analysis, data was acquired in Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) mode, monitoring previously identified peptides from EbfG1-4. MS2 resolution was set to 35,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time of 100 msec.Data processing and analysisFor identification purposes, raw data was first processed using Proteome Discoverer v1.41. MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot v2.4 (Matrix Sciences) and Sequest HT. Data were searched against the S. elongatus protein database as downloaded from UniprotKB (http://www.uniprot.org/), appended with EbfG1-4, along with 125 common laboratory contaminant proteins. Fixed modification was set to carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modification was set to oxidation of methionines. Search results were then imported back to Expressions to annotate identified peaks. Proteins were then grouped based on shared peptides and Identifications were filtered such that the global false discovery rate was maximum of 1%. For PRM analysis, raw data and DDA search results were imported into the Skyline software (https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/). The software was used for retention time alignment, peak detection of peptide fragments and their quantification.Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric test, because the majority of the data (or any viable transformation of it) are not normally distributed.RNA preparation and RT-PCRRNA was prepared as previously described48 and treated with DNase (TURBO DNase, Ambion). Random hexamers (Promega) were used to prime cDNA using 1.5 \u03bcg RNA and reverse transcriptase (RevertAid, Fermentas). PCR amplification was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with addition of betaine pH 9.0 (final concentration of 0.525M) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Melting curve analysis was performed (65 to 95 \u00b0C, 0.5 \u00b0C/5s) to confirm amplification of a single cDNA sequence for each gene. Primer dimers or unexpected amplicons were not observed. No signals were detected in the negative controls (samples in which reverse transcriptase was not added). Specific primers for RT-qPCR and RT-PCR of the ebfG1-4 transcript are indicated in Table S4. Transcript levels of psbC, encoding CP43, a chlorophyll binding protein of photosystem II, served to normalize total RNA levels.For statistical analysis we employed three factor ANOVA to calculate the covariance (normality and equality of variances were tested using Kruskal-Wallis & Levene\u2019s tests respectively, both found to be >0.05). Next, we used multiple comparison contrasts to evaluate the differences of each pair of comparison. In each bar graph in Fig. 3a, different letters assign statistical significance (see Table S2 for p-values)."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Preparation of Precisely Oriented Cryosections of Undistorted Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs for High Resolution Confocal Imaging", "keywords": " Cryosection, Frozen sections, Confocal microscopy, Wing imaginal disc, Drosophila Background Third instar imaginal discs are flat pocket-like involutions of the epidermis (Cohen, 1993; McClure and Schubiger, 2005). One layer of this pocket, the \u2018disc proper\u2019, is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that is heavily folded at the onset of metamorphosis. It is continuous with the \u2018overlaying\u2019 squamous epithelium, the peripodial membrane. The focus of our work is to understand how the Wnt morphogen patterns the dome-shaped wing pouch region of the wing disc. As imaginal discs are flat overall, conventional imaging has them mounted for top-down or upside-down observation, whereby cover-slips compress and distort the folded structure. The use of spacers prevents distortions, but imaging of the entire wing pouch using Z-stacks has proved unsatisfactory or impossible; as outlined above, the reduced resolution in the Z-axis typically prevents high-resolution reconstruction of the epithelium in the apical/basal direction. Therefore, only the apical half of the epithelium of the wing pouch is detected at high resolution. This problem is exacerbated if weak signals are to be detected. Thus, uniform imaging requires a \u2018side-view\u2019 that can be obtained in sections. We modified a cryosection protocol (Culbertson et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2012) to obtain transverse sections of wing discs at defined angles.

Place on ice and allow the gel to solidify about 30 min.9.  Under a dissecting microscope, use a razor blade to cut the gelatin into a block around the sample.Note: This should be done with regard to the desired orientation of the cryosection. For example, if cross-sections are desired across the wing pouch dorso-ventrally, one face of the gel block should be perpendicular to the dorsoventral boundary (Figures 3A and 3C).()Figure 3.

(Hudson, NY). Phenotyping assays were conducted in homozygous null and compound heterozygous animals of multiple combinations of confirmed null alleles. The single copy number of the Bglap gene was demonstrated in the presence of only two bands in HMAs of heterozygous animals and of only one band in the homozygous wild-type and null mutant animals. Additionally, following genotyping, all null mutant animals had total loss of protein by serum ELISA, western blot and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2D\u2013F). All procedures using the rat (Rattus norvegicus) in this project were conducted with the approval of the IACUC and the UAB Animal Resources Program (ARP), with only the requested number of animals needed for completion of the project. The ARP has been accredited by AAALAC since 1971. UAB is registered as a research institution with the USDA and is in full compliance with the NIH policy on animal welfare as filed with the Office for Protection from Research Risks on April 16, 1979, and reaffirmed on April 1, 1990 (#A3255-01).CRISPR sgRNA design and synthesisCRISPR guide RNAs were designed using the MIT Server to target exons 1 and 2 in the rat osteocalcin locus. Rbglap-CRISPR1 (Exon 1, reverse strand) was 5\u2032-CAGAGAGGCAGAATGCAGTCAGG-3\u2032; Rbglap-CRISPR2 (Exon 2, reverse strand) was 5\u2032-TTTGTCAGACTCAGAGTCGCTGG-3\u2032 [nucleotides in italics represent the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), the sequence required for CRISPR/Cas9 targeting]. Annealed oligonucleotides encoding the guideRNA were cloned into a plasmid vector (Hwang et al., 2013) and confirmed by sequencing. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were generated using the Ampliscribe T7 RNA transcription kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) and purified. Cas9 mRNA was in vitro transcribed using the pCS2-nCas9n plasmid (gift of Wenbiao Chen, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, USA; Jao et al., 2013) and SP6 in vitro transcription kit (CellScript Inc., Madison, WI). The final concentration of Cas9 mRNA and CRISPR sgRNA in the injection solution were 25 ng \u00b5l\u22121 and 50 ng \u00b5l\u22121, respectively.GonadotropinsFemale Sprague-Dawley rat embryo donors from 3 weeks of age to adulthood were administered 20 IU of PMSG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 3 days prior to the day taken as conception followed by 30 IU of HCG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) 2 days later to induce superovulation. At 5 days prior to the day taken as conception recipient Sprague-Dawley female rats over 8 weeks of age were administered 40 IU of LHRHa (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to synchronize estrous cycles. Donor and recipient females were mated to stud and vasectomized Sprague Dawley males, respectively, on one day prior to the day taken as conception.Collection of embryosAt day 0.5 post-conception, the synchronized donor female was humanely sacrificed using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. The animal was placed in dorsal recumbency and the abdomen was liberally scrubbed with betadine. The abdomen was carefully opened to expose the abdominal cavity and the uterine horns were sequentially grasped carefully with blunt forceps to allow tracing to the corresponding ovary. The oviduct was isolated, excised, and flushed with sterile medium to expose the cumulus masses containing fertilized embryos. Embryos were cultured in KSOM (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) prior to microinjection.MicroinjectionFertilized embryos were placed in M2 medium (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and covered in embryo-tested mineral oil on a Leitz/Leica Laborlux S Nomarski DIC microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The CRISPR/Cas9 solution was injected directly into the pronuclei using an injection needle and holding pipette controlled by micromanipulators.Embryo transferInstruments were sterilized by bead sterilization for 5 s. Anesthesia was induced in the recipient rat by placement in a chamber with 1.0\u20131.5 l min\u22121 of 5% isoflurane with oxygen as a carrier gas and maintained during surgery with 3% isoflurane by placement of the nose of the pre-anesthetized rat in a nose cone after subcutaneous injection of 0.10 ml of 0.3 mg ml\u22121 buprenorphine (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Richmond, VA) and 0.2 ml of 5 mg ml\u22121carprofen (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). The lower back of the recipient rat was shaved above the left uterine horn, and placed on a sterile tissue on the stage of the microscope. The oviduct was exposed through an incision in the abdominal wall. The manipulated embryos were then injected into the oviduct by gentle pressure through the pipette into the ostium of the oviduct. The reproductive tract was then carefully replaced in the abdomen, the abdomen was closed using suture in the body wall, and the skin was closed with a single wound clip. Post-surgical analgesics were provided [subcutaneous injection 0.2 ml carprofen (5 mg ml\u22121) after 24 h].Animal identificationAnimals were identified by cage card, sex and through unique \u2018ear tags\u2019 consecutively numbered that were affixed at weaning.BiopsiesTail biopsies were performed when animals were weaned. A 5\u20137 mm portion of the distal segment of the tail was cut and the remainder cauterized for analysis. Genomic DNA was purified from the lysed tail samples.Identification of foundersFounder animals were identified by PCR using primers flanking the target loci that amplified a 601-bp fragment in wild-type animals (Rnbglap-genF1, 5\u2032-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3\u2032; Rnbglap-genR1, 5\u2032-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3\u2032). Positive samples were confirmed by modified Sanger sequencing. Heteroduplex formation of amplified fragments was facilitated by denaturing the PCR samples at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and slowly cooling the samples to 4\u00b0C over \u223c20 min to enable renaturation. The re-annealed samples, which included homoduplexes and heteroduplexes, were run on 6% polyacrylamide-TBE gels at 100 V for 45 min before staining with ethidium bromide to visualize bands under UV light. Samples showing heteroduplex mobility shifts were cloned into a plasmid vector (pCR 2.1) using the TOPO-TA kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Recombinant plasmids with inserts were isolated and subjected to Sanger sequencing to obtain sequence information of modified alleles.Genotyping procedureThe following PCR primer sets were used to identify the indel alleles found in F0, F1 and F2 animals: Rnbglap-genF1, 5\u2032-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3\u2032 and Rnbglap-genR1, 5\u2032-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3\u2032 (601 bp); Rnbglap-genF2, 5\u2032-AAGTCCCACACAGCAACTC-3\u2032 and Rnbglap-genR2, 5\u2032-CGGAGTCTATTCACCACCTTAC-3\u2032 (474 bp); and Rnbglap-genR3, 5\u2032-CTCTCTGGTAGTTTGTCCCTTC-3\u2032 and Rnbglap-genF3, 5\u2032-CACAGCATCCTTTGGGTTTG-3 (329 bp).Western blottingTissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold T-PER lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a protease inhibitor tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). For immunoblotting, protein was loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and separated by electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at 100 V for 50 min, and crosslinked using 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight with a monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves, et al. (2013)] diluted 1:2500 at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG secondary antibody. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical analyses of osteocalcin was performed as previously described (Cook et al., 2013). Briefly, excised femurs were submerged in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for fixation before decalcification with 10% EDTA and paraffin embedment. 5-\u03bcm-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded decalcified femoral tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed and boiled for 20 min in a diluted (1:30), pH 9.0 antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were incubated in a horse serum blocking solution (ImmPRESS system, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h followed by incubation with monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves et al. (2013)] in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibody (ImmPRESS, Vector Laboratories) was applied and slides were incubated in DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate solution (Dako). Each slide was then incubated with Harris hematoxylin counterstain (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells positive for osteocalcin stained brown.DXAIn vivo body composition of the rats was assessed using the GE Lunar Prodigy DXA with Small Animal Software (GE, Madison, WI; v.6.10) as previously described and validated (Moreau et al., 2001; Bertin et al., 1998). The rats were anesthetized with a constant flow of 4% isoflurane in oxygen. They were then placed in a prostrated position on the DXA and scanned using the Small Animal Software (v.6.10). Each scan took \u223c5 min and the resulting data were analyzed by drawing a region of interest that included the entire rat. Data obtained from this scan included total body fat mass, lean mass, BMD and BMC.Insulin tolerance test and glucose tolerance testRats were fasted for 4 h prior to the ITT conducted in the afternoon and overnight prior to the GTT conducted in the morning. After the fast, the rats were weighed and placed in a clear restraint tube which allowed easy access to the tail for blood sampling. The tip of the tail (1 mm) was cut with a scalpel for the baseline sample. Blood was collected from this same point throughout the test, without needing to cut the tail again. Approximately 2 \u00b5l of blood per read was analyzed for glucose content using the Alphatrak analyzer and strips (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). Insulin or glucose was injected into the peritoneal cavity after the baseline glucose measurement and blood glucose was measured at the following time points post injection: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min. Doses of insulin and glucose were dependent on the glucose status of the animals and were 0.75 IU kg\u22121 and 1.50 mg g\u22121, respectively.\u00b5CTWild-type littermates and osteocalcin-null rats of 5 months of age were sacrificed and their femurs were dissected. Excised rat femurs were scanned using the Scanco \u00b5CT40 desktop cone-beam \u00b5CT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Br\u00fcttisellen, Switzerland). The femur was placed inverted in a 20-mm diameter scanning holder and scanned at the following settings: 20-mm resolution, 70 kVp and 114 \u00b5A with an integration time of 200 ms. Scans were automatically reconstructed into 2D slices and all slices were analyzed using the \u00b5CT Evaluation Program (v.6.5-2, Scanco Medical, Br\u00fcttisellen, Switzerland). For the cortical analysis, the bone was scanned at the midshaft of the bone for a scan of 50 slices. The region of interest (ROI) was drawn on every slice and fitted to the outside of the cortical bone, to include all the bone and marrow. The threshold for cortical bone was set at 316 (grayscale value). The 3D reconstruction was performed using all of the outlined slices. Data were obtained on bone volume (BV), total volume (TV), BV/TV, bone density and cortical thickness. An additional analysis was performed using the software to measure the periosteal circumference using the same outlines. For the analysis of endosteal circumferences, a new ROI was drawn and fitted to the inside of the cortical bone. The same analysis was then performed as for the periosteal circumference. For the trabecular bone, the scan was started distal to the growth plate and consisted of 312 slices. The region of interest started at the point on the scan where the condyles ended. From this point, 200 slices were outlined on the inside of the cortical bone, enclosing only the trabecular bone and marrow. Trabecular bone was thresholded at 211 (grayscale value) and the 3D analysis performed on the 200 slices. Data were obtained on trabecular bone volume, total volume, thickness, density, separation and number.Biomechanical strength testingThree-point bending tests were completed using an MTS 858 MiniBionix (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) equipped with a 15,000 N load cell (calibrated to 1500 N). Upon killing, the femurs were harvested, cleaned of soft tissues, wrapped in saline-moistened gauze and frozen until use. The bones were placed onto a custom three-point bending apparatus such that primary loading occurs in the posterior to anterior direction. The rate of deformation was established (typically 0.1\u20130.5 mm s\u22121), and data recorded with a sampling rate of 100 Hz using MTS Basic Testware (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN) with parameters being time, axial force and deflection. These data were imported into Excel for analysis and the maximum force, maximum bending moment, stiffness (the slope of the force-displacement curve), and energy to maximum force (area under the force\u2013displacement curve from the point of contact to the point of maximum force) were calculated.Collection of serumWhole blood was collected into 1.5 ml tubes at the time of killing by cardiac puncture with a 26 gauge needle. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 min. Serum was collected into 1.5 ml tubes and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayA sandwich-type EIA Rat Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Nojihigashi, Japan; cat. no. MK147) was used according to manufacturer instructions to measure osteocalcin in serum from osteocalcin-null and wild-type male rats.Statistical analysesOutcomes were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) by two-tailed parametric unpaired t-tests with a 95% confidence level or a s.e.m., or as the area under the curve, with one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA as appropriate. P\u22640.05 was considered significant. Outliers were determined by Grubb's outlier test (a=0.05) and excluded from analyses."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Formalin Murine Model of Pain", "keywords": " Pain, Nociception, Inflammation, Analgesia, Mice Background The formalin test is an experimental assay that permits determining mice nocifensive behaviour. Thus, the mice response (i.e., licking and flinching) is assessed after a subcutaneous injection of formalin normally in the plantar hind paw (Tjolsen et al., 1992). The test was originally described in the late seventies (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977), and, initially, it consisted of the injection of 50~ul of 5% formalin in the dorsal surface of one forepaw of a rat or a cat. Since then, the formalin test has been extensively used to assess nociception and inflammation-related responses, thus being adapted according to each study\u2019s aim. Mice and rats are frequently used due to their innate grooming behaviour (i.e., forepaw licking). Accordingly, a 2.5% formalin (in physiological saline solution) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the rodent hind paw is commonly used to induce nociceptive responses (i.e., paw \u2018flinching\u2019 and licking) lasting for 45-90 min (Tjolsen et al., 1992).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2628", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Habituation"}, "1.1": "Individually expose the animals to be tested to the observational chamber for 1h, one day before the experiment.", "2": {"title": "Reagents Preparation"}, "2.1": "Prepare the 2.5% formalin solution and the drug to be tested on the day of the experiment.", "2.2": "Clean all the material needed.", "3": {"title": "Weighing Animals"}, "3.1": "Remove the mouse from the house cage and measure its body weight using a weighing machine.", "4": {"title": "Administration of the Analgesic Drug"}, "4.1": "Administer the analgesic drug to be tested intraperitoneally using an insulin syringe.", "4.2": "Adjust the amount of drug to be administered according to the dose to be tested and the mouse body weight.", "4.3": "Ensure all animal experimentation is carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments.", "5": {"title": "Acclimation"}, "5.1": "Place the animal in the observational chamber for 20 min before recording formalin administration.", "5.2": "Optionally, place a colored plastic surface below the observational chamber for contrasting the animal's hair.", "6": {"title": "Formalin Loading"}, "6.1": "Load 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution directly into the 0.3m insulin syringe equipped with a 30 G needle.", "6.2": "Alternatively, take the 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution with a 2-20ul micropipette, place it in a 100ul Eppendorf tube, and then load the insulin syringe.", "7": {"title": "Formalin Administration"}, "7.1": "Take the animal from the observational cage and place it carefully inside the restrain module with the selected hind paw exposed outside.", "7.2": "Inject slowly the 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution into the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw using the insulin syringe.", "7.3": "Ensure the needle is placed in between toes and ankle and inserted beneath the surface of the skin to avoid tissue damage.", "8": {"title": "Phase I (0-5 min)"}, "8.1": "Return the injected animal to its observational chamber and set the timer for 5 min.", "8.2": "Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period.", "8.3": "Annotate the result and switch on and off the recording system if used.", "9": {"title": "Quiescent Period (5-15 min)"}, "9.1": "Stop the timer and leave the animal without disturbing it for 10 min.", "10": {"title": "Phase II (15-30 min)"}, "10.1": "Set the timer for 15 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase II.", "10.2": "Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period.", "10.3": "Annotate the result.", "11": {"title": "Finishing"}, "11.1": "Return the animal to its home cage.", "11.2": "Check whether the animal needs any special attention or health care.", "12": {"title": "Cleaning"}, "12.1": "Clean all the material used.", "12.2": "Repeat the experiment with another animal if required and visualize the videos to measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during each period."}, "text_flat": "Formalin Murine Model of Pain\n\n1.

Administration of the analgesic drugAdminister (i.e., intraperitoneally, i.p.) the analgesic drug to be tested (i.e., raseglurant; Figure 2) or the same volume of vehicle (physiological saline solution) using an insulin syringe (Figure 1d).Note: The amount (400-500 \u03bcl) of drug to be administered should be adjusted according to the dose to be tested (i.e., 10 mg/kg of raseglurant) and the mouse body weight (20-25~g) . For example, for a mouse of _20g of weight we will administer (i.p.) 400 \u03bcl of a 500 mg/L raseglurant solution in saline. In addition, all animal experimentation should be carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments.5.  AcclimationThe animal is placed in the observational chamber for 20 min before recording formalin administration (Figure 2).Note: A coloured plastic surface (i.e., black) could be placed below the observational chamber for contrasting the animal\u2019s hair (i.e., CD-1 mice have white hair) (Figure 1e).()Figure 2. Treatment schedule depicting the administration regimen of drug, formalin and the behavioural testing (phase I and II)6.  Formalin loadingLoad 20~ul of 2.5% formalin solution directly in the 0.3m insulin syringe equipped with a 30 G needle.Note: Optionally, the 20 \u00b5l of 2.5% formalin solution could be taken with a 2-20 \u00b5l micropipette, placed in a 100 \u00b5l Eppendorf tube and then load the insulin syringe with.# 7.  Formalin administrationTake the animal from the observational cage and place it carefully inside the restrain module (Figure 1f) with the selected (i.e., right) hind paw exposed outside (Figure 3A). Inject slowly the 20~ul of 2.5% formalin solution using the insulin syringe in the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw (Figure 3B).Notes:a.  The needle should be placed in between toes and ankle and inserted beneath the surface of the skin, thus any tissue damage should be avoided.b.  The injection should be done firmly and time-optimized. Animals could perceive the restrain as stressor stimulus and that can increase the variability of the results.()Figure 3. Hind paw of a restrained mouse (A) and administration of formalin solution (B)# 8.  Phase I (0-5 min)Return the injected animal to its observational chamber. Set the timer for 5 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase I (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (5 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.Notes:a.  If a recording system is used, switch on and off the system accordingly. b.  We strongly recommend the investigator to perform some training at this step to familiarize themselves with the licking/biting behavior.9.  Quiescent period (5-15m i n) )Stop the timer and leave the animal without disturbing it for 10 min (Figure 2).10. Phase II (15-30 min)Set the timer for 15 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase II (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (15 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.# 11. FinishingReturn the animal to its home cage.Note: If a recording system is used switch off the camera. Check whether the animal needs any special attention or health care (i.e., bleeding, extra tissue damage, etc.).# 12. CleaningClean all the material used.Note: Repeat the experiment with another animal if required. If a camera is used, visualize the videos and measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during each period (phase I and II) (Video 1).()Video 1.

The pfat-7::GFP (rtIs30) carrying strain HA1842 was a kind gift from Amy Walker [31], and its quantification was performed as previously described [10]. C. elegans strains maintenance and experiments were performed at 20\u00b0C using the E. coli strain OP50 as food source, which was maintained on LB plates kept at 4\u00b0C (re-streaked every 6\u20138 weeks) and single colonies were picked for overnight cultivation at 37\u00b0C in LB medium then used to seed NGM plates [56]; new LB plates were streaked every 3\u20134 months from OP50 stocks kept frozen at -80\u00b0C.Plates with supplementsStock solutions of supplements (1M glucose, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and lactate; 5 M NaCl and KCl; 50 mM fluvastatin) were filter sterilized then added to cooled NGM after autoclaving; 100 mM paraquat, 30 mM FCCP (in ethanol), pure DMSO and pure glycerol were used without sterilization.Seeding of NGM plates with E. coli mutantsThe Keio collection of E. coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockouts was used as source of E. coli mutants and kept in the presence of 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin [15]. Mutants were picked as single colonies from LB plates and cultivated overnight at 37\u00b0C in LB then seeded onto NGM plates with or without additives. All mutants were confirmed by PCR.MacConkey agar assayE. coli strains were streaked onto MacConkey agar plates with 0.4% glucose, grown at 37\u00b0C over night and scored for colony color.Growth and tail tip scoring assaysFor length measurement studies, synchronized L1s were plated onto test plates seeded with E. coli, and worms were mounted then photographed 96 hour (oleic acid rescue experiments) or 72 hours (all other experiments) later. The length of >20 worms was measured using ImageJ [57]. Quantification of the withered tail tip phenotype was done on synchronous 1-day old adult populations, i.e. 72 h post L1 (n\u2265100) [10].Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)FRAP experiments in C. elegans were carried out using a membrane-associated prenylated GFP reporter expressed in intestinal cells, as previously described and using a Zeiss LSM700inv laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion objective [11,58]. Briefly, the GFP-positive membranes were photobleached over a circular (7 pixel radius) using 20 iterations of the 488 nm laser with 50% laser power transmission. Images were collected at a 12-bit intensity resolution over 256x256 pixels (digital zoom 4X) using a pixel dwell time of 1.58 \u03bcsec, and were all acquired under identical settings. For FRAP in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were stained with BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 (4,4-Difluoro-5-Methyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3-Dodecanoic Acid) (Invitrogen) at 2 \u03bcg/ml in PBS for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. FRAP images were acquired with an LSM880 confocal microscope equipped with a live cell chamber (set at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2) and ZEN software (Zeiss) with a 40X water immersion objective. Cells were excited with a 488 nm laser and the emission between 493 and 589 nm recorded. Images were acquired with 16 bits image depth and 256x256 resolution using a pixel dwell of ~ 1.34 \u03bcs. Ten pre-bleaching images were collected and then the region of interest was beached with 50% of laser power. The recovery of fluorescence was traced for 25 seconds. Fluorescence recovery and Thalf were calculated as previously described [11].Pre-loading of E. coli with fatty acidsStocks of 0.1 M palmitic acid or 0.5 M oleic acid dissolved in ethanol were diluted in LB media to final concentrations of 0.25\u20132 mM, inoculated with OP50 bacteria, then shaken overnight at 37\u00b0C. The bacteria were then washed twice with M9 to remove fatty acids and growth media, diluted to equal OD600, concentrated 10X by centrifugation, dissolved in M9 and seeded onto NGM plates lacking peptone (200\u03bcl/plate). Worms were added the following day.LipidomicsFor worm lipidomics, samples were composed of synchronized L4 larvae (one 9 cm diameter plate/sample) grown overnight on OP50-seeded NGM, NGM containing 20mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate, or plates lacking peptone but seeded with fatty acid-supplemented bacteria. Worms were washed 3 times with M9, pelleted and stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. For bacterial lipidomics, E. coli liquid cultures grown overnight at 37\u00b0C were seeded on NGM, NGM containing 20 mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate or concentrated (as described above) and seeded on plates lacking peptone for lipid-supplemented cultures, kept upside-down at 20\u00b0C then washed off 96 h later using pure water, pelleted then frozen at -80\u00b0C until analysis. For HEK293 lipidomics, cells were cultivated in serum-free media with or without fatty acids for 24 h prior to harvesting using TrypLE Express (Gibco). For lipid extraction, the pellet was sonicated for 10 minutes in methanol and then extracted according to published methods [59]. Internal standards were added during the extraction. Lipid extracts were evaporated and reconstituted in chloroform:methanol [1:2] with 5 mM ammonium acetate. This solution was infused directly (shotgun approach) into a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrophotometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a Nanomate Triversa (Advion Bioscience, Ithaca, NY) as described previously [60]. Phospholipids were measured using multiple precursor ion scanning [61,62]. Ceramides from HEK293 cells were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry according to previous publication [63]. The data was evaluated using the LipidView software (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The complete lipidomics dataset is provided in the supplementary S1 File.Cultivation of HEK293HEK293 were grown in DMEM containing glucose 1 g/l, pyruvate and GlutaMAX and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, HEPES 10 mM and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) at 37\u00b0C in a water humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were sub-cultured twice a week at 90% confluence. Cells were cultivated on treated plastic flask and multi-dish plates (Nunc). For FRAP experiments, HEK293 were seeded in glass bottom dishes (Ibidi) pre-coated with 0.1% porcine gelatin (Sigma).siRNA in HEK293 cellsThe following pre-designed siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon: AdipoR1 J-007800-10-005 (set 1) and J-007800-09-0002 (set 2), AdipoR2 J-007801-10-0005 (set 1) and J-007801-09-0002 (set 2), GAPDH D-001830-10-05, Non-target D-001810-01-05 or D-001810-10-05, and SCD J-005061-07-0005. Transfection of 25 nM siRNA was performed in complete media using Viromer Blue according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions 1X (Lipocalyx). Knockdown gene expression was verified 48 h after transfection.Quantitative PCR in HEK293 cellsTotal cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific). cDNA was obtained using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem) with random hexamers. qPCR were performed with a CFX Connect thermal cycler (Bio Rad) using Hot FIREpol EvaGreen qPCR SuperMix (Solis Biodyne) and standard primers. Samples were measured as triplicates. The relative expression of each gene was calculated according to the \u0394\u0394CT method [64]. Expression of the housekeeping gene PPIA was used to normalize for variations in RNA input. Primers used were: AdipoR1-For (CCATCTGCTTGGTTTCGTGC) and -Rev (AGACGGTGTGAAAGAGCCAG), AdipoR2-For (TCATCTGTGTGCTGGGCATT) and -Rev (CTATCTGCCCTATGGTGGCG), GAPDH-For (GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT) and -Rev (TAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAGG), PPIA-For (GTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAG) and -Rev (GGACAAGATGCCAGGACCC), and SCD-For (TTCGTTGCCACTTTCTTGCG) and -Rev (TGGTGGTAGTTGTGGAAGCC).HEK293 fatty acid and FCCP treatmentPA and OA were dissolved in sterile DMSO (Sigma) then mixed with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in serum-free medium for 20 min at room temperature. The molecular ratio of BSA to fatty acid was 1 to 5.3 (except in the experiment using using 200 \u03bcM PA in which case the ratio was 1 to 2.65). Cells were then cultivated in this serum-free media containing the fatty acids for 24 h prior to analysis, and with 400 \u03bcM PA or OA being used unless stated otherwise. FCCP was dissolved in ethanol to produce a 30 mM stock and used at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM in serum-free-media for 4 hours prior to analysis.StatisticsError bars for worm length measurements show the standard error of the mean, and t-tests were used to identify significant differences between worm lengths. SFA/MUFA ratios were normalized using a logN conversion prior to test for significance using a t-test. Error bars for the frequency of the tail tip defect show the 95% confidence interval and significant differences determined using Z-tests. t-tests were also used to determine significance in FRAP experiments, and the lipidomics data in HEK293 cells was analyzed using ANOVA and a Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. All experiments were repeated several times with similar results. Asterisks are used in the figures to indicate various degrees of significance, where *: p<0.05; **: p<0.01; and ***: p<0.001."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Assessment of Murine Retinal Function by Electroretinography", "keywords": " Electroretinogram (ERG), Mice, Retinal degeneration, Photoreceptors Background Electroretinograms (ERGs) are used by researchers and clinicians to test retinal function by measuring the electrical response of retinal cells to a light stimulus. The ERG is a useful tool for measuring retinal responses in mice due to its high level of sensitivity and noninvasive nature, and can be utilized to assess eye disease and retinal degeneration (Duncan et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Vollrath et al., 2015). In mouse genetic retinal disease models, ERGs can be used to assess retinal degeneration at multiple time points as the disease progresses (Duncan et al., 2003). For studies evaluating the effect of drug treatment on the mouse eye, retinal function can be assessed before and after treatment in the same eye (Zhao et al., 2011). In the following protocol, we describe a method for measuring the functional response of photoreceptors and downstream retinal cells in mice that builds on a previously published approach (Phillips et al., 2010).

Day before experiment1.  Place mice in a light-proof dark room and allow them to dark-adapt overnight. a.  Check with your institution on regulations regarding overnight housing of animals. b.  A lux meter can be used to assess if the room is light-proof.2.  Warm the non-electric heat pad in a 37^\u00b0C bath or incubator overnight.B.  Prepping for the experiment1.  Set up the dark room a.  Existing light sources can be used if covered with red filter to make them procedure-safe. b.  Cover the computer monitor and any miscellaneous lights with red filter or black electrical tape. c.  Cover the 37~^\u00b0C heat pad with an absorbent pad. Position the elevated platform with heat pad on top so that the mouse can be easily prepared and moved into the dome. Note: The heat pad may need to be reheated to 37^\u00b0C if multiple animals are tested.2.  Move mice to experimental dark room if different from overnight adaption room. This can be done using either a blackout cloth or light-proof box. Mice that are not being tested should be kept in a dark environment.3.  Set stimulus settings as described below.# C.  Preparing the miceNote: From this point on, only red-filtered light sources should be used in order to keep mice darkadapted.1.  Anesthetize the mouse by injection of ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine hydrochloride (80 m g/k g/13 m g/k g) , and allow mice to become fully sedated (2-5m i n) ). Check for a toe-pinch response to ensure the animal is adequately anesthetized.2.  Treat both eyes with 1% atropine sulfate, 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, and 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride, allowing drops to sit on the eyes for 2 min before wicking with a cotton swab and applying the next drop. After this point the eyes should be kept hydrated with a hydrating eye ointment until the contact lens electrodes are applied (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Anesthetized mouse with atropine sulfate, phenylephrine hydrochloride, proparacaine hydrochloride, and hydrating eye drops3.  Position the mouse on the heated platform. Place the ground needle electrode in the base of the tail, and reference needle electrode subdermally between the eyes (Figure 2). a.  Forceps can be used to lift the skin between the eyes for a more controlled insertion.()Figure 2. Electrode placement on the mouse4.  Wick any excess moisture from the eyes, and add a small drop of 2.5% hypromellose to each eye.5.  Use fingers or forceps to position the contact lens electrodes onto the corneas. The hypromellose should keep the lenses in place. It may be helpful to tape down the electrode wires to the pad using surgical tape so they do not shift during the experiment (Figure 3, Video 1).()Figure 3. Contact lens electrodes on the mouse eyeVideo 1. Applying the contact lens electrodes to the mouse eye()6.  Slide the heated platform into the dome so that the mouse\u2019s eyes are inside of the dome (Figures 4 and 5).()Figure 4. Mouse with electrodes on the heated, elevated platform()# Figure 5. Mouse with eyes inside of the Ganzfeld ColorDome7.  Before beginning and throughout the scotopic and photopic assays, periodically check that impedance levels are acceptably low (within the green range). A low impedance level indicates that the electrodes have been properly installed.Note: The impedance may be high if any of the electrodes have shifted and the circuit has been broken. The Espion visual electrophysiology system displays impedance using green, yellow and red bars to signify the level of resistance in the circuit.D.  Running the scotopic (dark-adapted) ERG1.  Settings to record scotopic ERGs()2.  Start with the following settings5 trials/step Pulse frequency: 0.2Hz Sample frequency: 1,000 Hz Trial pre-trigger time: 20 msec Trial post-trigger time: 250 msec3.  Run through each step of light intensity using the Espion E2 system. Note: Check the impedance every 2-3 steps or as needed to ensure that the electrode circuit has not been broken.E.  Running the photopic (light-adapted) ERG1.  Light adapt the mouse for at least 10 min at a light intensity of 20 cd s e c/m^2 . Light adaptation saturates the rod response so that the cones, which account for only 3% of the photoreceptor population in the mouse eye, can be stimulated and recorded without rod interference (Fu, 2010).Note: It may be necessary to give the mouse a second, reduced dose of ketamine/xylazine if the animal begins to wake up.2.  Settings to record photopic ERGs()3.  Start with the following settings:25 trials/step Pulse frequency: 1.0Hz Sample frequency: 1,000 Hz Trial pre-trigger time: 20 msec Trial post-trigger time: 250 msec4.

Jensen from the Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. The use of anonymous NHDFs for basic research is conducted under the guidelines from the Danish Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics. All studies were conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html). NHDF were cultured in D10 medium consisting of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. All ethical approval and consent was received for the acquisition of these cells. Human iPSCs were cultured in knockout serum replacement (KSR) media, consisting of knockout DMEM (10829\u2013018, Gibco), 20 % Knock Out Serum Replacement (10828\u2013028, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (11140\u2013050, Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (313-50-010, Gibco) and 10 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (PHG0026, Invitrogen). The mRNA-iPSCs and mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 were generated by mRNA transfection and characterized previously [16]. The human lenti-iPSCs were generated with lentivirus transduction using a single polycistronic lentiviral vector expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC according to the methods reported by Papapetrou et al. [17]. Human BM-MSCs were purchased from Lonza (PT-2501) and cultured in MSC medium consisting of DMEM-low glucose (31885\u2013023, Gibco), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS; 26140\u2013079, Gibco), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. The K562 cells were kindly provided by Marianne Hokland from the Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University. All cells were cultured in a tissue culture incubator with 5 % CO2 at 37 \u00b0C.Lentivirus packagingHEK293 cells were cultured in D10 medium. At the day of transfection, 1 \u00d7 107 HEK293 cells in each P15 dish (nine dishes in total) were transfected by the CaPO4 co-precipitation method with pRSV-REV, pMD.2G, pMDGP-Lg/pRRE plasmids and a lentiviral vector (pLM-fSV2A, Addgene ID 27512 [18]) expressing the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, KLF4, c-Myc and SOX2) polycistronically. One day after transfection, cells were fed with fresh medium (17 ml/dish). Cell medium containing lentivirus was harvested at 48 h and 72 h post-transfection. Lentivirus was concentrated by ultra-centrifugation (25,000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, L7 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman). Virus pellets were dissolved with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Virus titer was measured with the P24 Elisa kit (XB-1000, XpressBio).Lentivirus-mediated reprogrammingNHDFs (1.5 \u00d7 105 cells/per well) were seeded in a six-well plate 1 day before transduction. Cells were transduced with reprogramming lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (8 \u03bcg/mL) in D10 medium. Cell media were changed every other day. Six days post-transduction, transduced NHDFs (2 \u00d7 104 cells/per well) were harvested by trypsinization and seeded on irradiation-inactivated mouse feeder cells in six-well plates, and cultured in KSR medium. KSR medium was changed daily. Approximately 21 days post-transduction, the iPSC colonies were ready for picking and expansion.Immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min, followed by PBS wash (three times, 5 min each) and permeabilization with 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with blocking solution (5 % donkey serum in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Goat antihuman OCT3/4 (Abcam, ab27985, 100\u00d7 diluted) and rabbit antihuman Nanog (Abcam, ab80892, 100\u00d7 diluted) were used. Cells were then stained with a secondary antibody for 2 h. Alexa 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Life Technologies) were used for second antibody staining. For live cell staining of TRA-1-60 and CD44, cells were stained using the live cell imaging kit from Life Technologies (Tra-1-60 AF594, CD44 AF488) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All images were taken with a Leica fluorescence microscope.Derivation of MSCs from iPSCs generated by lentiviral reprogrammingThe iPSC-MSC derivation was performed according to our previous protocol. One characterized pluripotent lenti-iPSC line was used for MSC differentiation. Briefly, 3 days after passaging the lenti-iPSCs to feeder cell culture, the KSR medium was replaced with MSC medium. The lenti-iPSCs were maintained in MSC medium for 2 weeks, with medium changed every other day. Subsequently, cells were passaged to gelatin-coated (0.1 % gelatin, room temperature for 2 h) tissue culture vessels by trypsinization (0.25 % trypsin/1 mM EDTA). Cells were defined as passage 1 (P1) after the first passaging. For maintenance of iPSC-MSCs, cells were passaged when 90 % confluent and seeded with a density of 1.6 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 to new tissue culture vessels.MSC surface marker characterization by flow cytometryDetail information on antibodies against the human antigens CD11b, CD14, CD29, CD31, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105 and HLA-DR are shown in Table 1. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with 2 % FBS-PBS twice; 2 \u00d7 105 cells were re-suspended in 100 \u03bcl 2 % FBS-PBS and incubated with the conjugated antibody for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Stained cells were then washed with 2 % FBS-PBS twice and re-suspended in 500 \u03bcl 1 % formaldehyde-PBS for flow cytometry analysis (LSRFortessa); 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and data were analyzed with Flowjo.Number of population doublingsBM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 and lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 were serially subcultured in six-well plates for 2 weeks. Briefly, cells were cultured in six-well plates; when cells were 90 % confluent, they were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. The cells were then cultured in a new six-well plate with the same starting cell density. The number of population doublings (NPD) was calculated according to the following equation: NPD = log10 (Nh/Ni) \u00d7 3.33, where Nh and Ni are the numbers of harvested and initiating cells, respectively [19]. NPDs were performed in six replicates for each type of MSC.Cell proliferation rate assayCell proliferation rate measurements were conducted using the Click-iT\u00ae EdU Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Cat. no. C10425, Life Technologies). K562, BM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001, and lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 cells were seeded in six-well plates (1.0 \u00d7 105 cells/well) 24 h prior to changing to fresh growth medium (negative control) or growth medium containing 10 \u03bcM EdU. Cells cultured in growth medium without EdU were used as negative controls. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO2 for 2 h, then harvested by trypsinization and subjected to EdU staining according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, cells were washed with 500 \u03bcL 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS, incubated with 100 \u03bcL Click-iT fixative for 15 min in the dark, washed with 500 \u03bcL 1 % BSA-PBS, re-suspended with 100 \u03bcL 1\u00d7 component E, stained in labeling cocktail for 30 min, washed with 500 \u03bcL 1\u00d7 component E, and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRFortessa); 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and data were analyzed with Flowjo.Tri-lineage differentiationBM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001, and lenti-iPS-MSC-A001 cells (all P9) were used for the tri-lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and adipogenesis).For osteogenic differentiation, cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 3 days, the media were changed to either MSC growth medium (as control) or osteogenic differentiation medium, which contains DMEM-high glucose (Invitrogen), 10 % FBS (Gibco), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nM dexamethasone (D2915, Sigma), 10 mM \u03b2-Glycerophosphate (G9891, Sigma), 50 \u03bcM ascorbic acid-2 phosphate (A8960, Sigma), and 10 \u03bcM Vit-D (D1530, Sigma). Cells were maintained in growth medium or osteogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks with medium changed every 3 days. At the end of differentiation, samples were subjected to Alizarin Red S (Sigma) staining, calcium quantification analysis following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and quantitative PCR analysis.For chondrogenic differentiation, 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to form a small pellet in a \u201cV\u201d shape 96-well plate. The cell pellets were cultured in either MSC growth medium (as control) or chondrogenic differentiation medium consisting of DMEM (F12, Gibco) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 50 \u03bcg/mL ascorbic acid, 100 nM dexamethasone, 1:100 ITS premix (BD Biosciences), 40 \u03bcg/ml L-proline (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL human recombinant TGF-\u03b23 (R&D systems), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin [16, 20]. The medium was changed every 3 days. After 3 weeks, cell pellets were collected for toluidine blue staining to validate the extracellular chondrocyte matrix [21]. Purple stain of proteoglycans was observed by phase-contrast microscopy.Adipogenic differentiation was carried out by culturing the cells at a density of 1.2 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM-high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15 % horse serum (Sigma), and 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (MSC growth medium as control). After 3 weeks, cells were stained with Oil-red O (Sigma-Aldrich) solution to evaluate differentiation using standard techniques as previously described [22].PCR and quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by quantification with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and qualification by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with approximately 50 ng of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (170\u20138891, Bio-Rad). PCR primers for stemness genes and osteogenic genes are listed in Table 2.For PCR characterization of the expression of stemness genes (OCT4, KLF4, C-MYC, SOX2, GDF3, CRIPTO, UTF1, DPPA4, DNMT3B, LIN28A and SALL4), PCR was performed with pfx DNA Polymerase (11708\u2013039, Invitrogen) using 2 \u03bcl (five times diluted) cDNA as DNA temperate. The following PCR program was optimized for each stemness gene: 1 cycle of 94 \u00b0C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60 \u00b0C or 58 \u00b0C or 53 \u00b0C (see Table 2) for 30 seconds, and 68 \u00b0C for 30 seconds; 1 cycle at 68 \u00b0C for 7 min. The GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control.For quantitative PCR of osteogenic genes (of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), and osteocalcin (OC)), 2 uL (five times diluted) cDNA was used. Quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycle 480 SYBR Green I Master kit on LightCycler 480 (Roche) with the following PCR program: 1 hold at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min; 50 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 seconds, 60 \u00b0C for 10 seconds, and 72 \u00b0C for 15 seconds. To mask the signal from primer dimers, fluorescent signal was measured at 77 \u00b0C for RUNX2, 80 \u00b0C for ALP, 82 \u00b0C for GAPDH and COL1A1, and 84 \u00b0C for OC. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394ct method after normalization to the reference gene GAPDH.StatisticsAll values are reported as mean \u00b1 SD. Data were checked for normal distribution using QQ-plots. The osteogenic gene expression between growth and osteogenic media were compared by t-test in each cell line. Quantitative calcium deposition was investigated using two-way analysis of variance (media type \u00d7 cell line). If interactions were observed, the variables were investigated separately by the Scheffe method. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Protocol for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Proteins", "keywords": " Molecular dynamics simulations, Conformational studies, Gromacs, Structural studies, Protein dynamics", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2051", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Obtain Protein Coordinates"}, "1.1": "Download the protein structure coordinate file in PDB format from the RCSB website.", "1.2": "Use RasMol tool for visual inspection of the protein structure and graphics rendering.", "1.3": "Use Gedit tool to open and edit the text files.", "1.4": {"title": "Pre-format the PDB File"}, "1.4.1": "Check for the presence of ligands or water molecules in the structure.", "1.4.2": "Extract the coordinates of the ligand and separate it from the main PDB file if necessary.", "1.4.3": "Construct a separate topology for the ligand and add the information to the main topology file.", "1.4.4": "Remove external water molecules from the PDB file if necessary.", "2": {"title": "Convert PDB File to GROMACS Format"}, "2.1": "Use the pdb2gmx command to convert the PDB file to a GROMACS specific molecular geometry file format (.GRO).", "2.2": "Select an appropriate force field for the simulations using the pdb2gmx command.", "2.3": "Generate a topology file with a.top extension using the pdb2gmx command.", "3": {"title": "Setup Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)"}, "3.1": "Define a box (supercell) around the protein using the editconf command.", "3.2": "Specify the box edge and type (e.g., cubic, triclinic, dodecahedron) using the editconf command.", "3.3": "Keep the protein in the center of the box using the -c flag.", "4": {"title": "Solvate the Box"}, "4.1": "Use the solvate command to add water molecules around the protein based on the box dimensions.", "4.2": "Update the topology file to include the topology of water molecules.", "5": {"title": "Neutralize the System"}, "5.1": "Use the genion command to add counter ions according to the total charge of the system.", "5.2": "Generate a gromacs pre-processor file containing the atomic description and topology of the molecule.", "6": {"title": "Preprocessing"}, "6.1": "Use the grompp command to collect parameters, topology, and coordinates into a single run input file.", "6.2": "Generate a.tpr file in binary format.", "7": {"title": "Energy Minimization"}, "7.1": "Use the grompp command to prepare the input file for energy minimization.", "7.2": "Submit the job for energy minimization using the mdrun command.", "7.3": "Generate output files including an energy file (.edr), trajectory file (.trr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).", "8": {"title": "Position Restraint Run (Optional)"}, "8.1": "Use the grompp command to prepare the input file for position restraint run.", "8.2": "Submit the job for position restraint run using the mdrun command.", "8.3": "Generate output files including an energy file (.edr), trajectory file (.trr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).", "9": {"title": "MD Simulations"}, "9.1": "Adjust the parameter file (md.mdp) for production run.", "9.2": "Use the grompp command to prepare the input file for MD simulations.", "9.3": "Submit the job for MD simulations using the mdrun command.", "9.4": "Generate output files including a trajectory file (.trr), energy file (.edr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).", "10": {"title": "Continuing or Extending MD Simulations"}, "10.1": "Use the tpbconv command to produce an input file for continuing or extending MD simulations.", "10.2": "Submit the job for continuing or extending MD simulations using the mdrun command."}, "text_flat": "Protocol for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Proteins\n\n1.

Obtain the protein coordinatesThe basic ingredient to start MD simulations is a protein structure coordinate file in PDB format that can be downloaded from RCSB website (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). RasMol tool is used for visual inspection of the protein structure and also for graphics rendering. Gedit tool is used to open and edit the text files.Note: The Protein Databank (http://www.pdb.org/) contains thousands of high resolution protein structures that are derived by X-ray/neutron scattering and NMR methods. When the protein structure of our interest is not available, a homology model as an initial starting structure may be built by a variety of software tools like Modeller, iTassar, Discovery Studio, Pepbuild web server etc. However, once the PDB is available and downloaded, it is necessary to pre-format it depending on the presence of ligands or water molecules in the structure. It occurs that ligand coordinates are present in the PDB file and the GROMACS software doesn\u2019t recognize the ligand. In this case, ligand chemistry needs to be explicitly defined by extracting the coordinates of the ligand and separated from main PDB file. A separated topology is constructed manually for the ligand and the information is added in the main topology file. It is also advised to remove external water molecules that are present in the PDB file.For this study, we have prepared a protein coordinate file named \u2018protein.pdb\u2019. And, every MD simulations software follows their specific format to handle the files. First, the PDB file is converted into a GROMACS specific molecular geometry file format (.GRO) by using the pdb2gmx command as shown below. The <.GRO> file contains the molecular structure coordinates with continuous atom numbering. Moreover, pdb2gmx command also generates a very important file called topology with \u2018.top\u2019 extension. The topology file contains the molecular description such as molecular parameters, bonding, force field and charges etc. It is noticeable that the pdb2gmx program adds the missing hydrogen atoms in the structure by default.pdb2gmx  -f  protein.pdb  -p  protein.top  -o protein.gro# where,-f flag reads the pdb file, -p flag is used for output of the topology file, -o flag is used to write into the Gromacs coordinate format.Note: The pdb2gmx prompts you to select an appropriate force field for the simulations. For example, in Gromacs v 5.1, a force field \u2018ffG53A7\u2019 is recommended for the simulations of proteins with explicit solvent.2.  Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC): Setup the box for simulations Periodic Boundary Conditions were applied for the protein to be simulated to keep track of the motion of all particles and to avoid/minimize the edge effect on the surface atoms. For this purpose, a box (supercell) is defined, and that supercell is surrounded by infinitely replicated, periodic images of itself (Li, 2005). Therefore a surface particle may interact not only with particles in the same supercell but also with particles in adjacent image supercells (Li, 2005). The command to generate a cubic box around the protein with a box edge of approximately 14A^\u00b0 from the proteins periphery is:# editconf  -f   protein.gro  -o  protein_editconf.gro  -bt  cubic  -d  1.4 \u2013cThe -c flag keeps the protein in the center of the box. The default measurement units are represented  in  nanometers.  There  are  also  other  box  types  available,  e.g.,  Triclinic, dodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron and octahedron. While cubic is a rectangular box with all sides equal, whereas dodecahedron represents a rhombic dodecahedron, a truncated version of octahedron.Note: An ideal value for the distance is at least 1.0\u00c5 or more for most systems.3.  Solvate the boxTo mimic the physiological environment for a protein, the simulation system (box around the protein) need to be solvated. This step is not necessary for simulations in vacuum. However, it is an essential step for the simulations of protein both in water and/or membrane. To solvate the protein, the \u2018solvate\u2019 command needs to be used. The \u2018solvate\u2019 command adds the required number of water molecules around the protein based upon the dimensions/box type that is specified in \u2018editconf\u2019 of step 2 above.# gmx solvate -cpprotein_editconf.gro   -p  protein.top   -o  protein _water.groNote: The topology (.top) file is updated and now it contains the topology of water molecules in addition to protein topology.It is necessary to neutralize the system prior to simulations. For that it is necessary to add counter ions according to the total charge of the system by using \u2018genion\u2019 command. Prior to use \u2018genion\u2019 command, a gromacs pre-processor file has to be generated which contains the atomic description ^+ topology of the molecule being studied.4.  PreprocessingThe preprocessing in Gromacs is done by using \u2018grompp\u2019 command that is used to collect parameters, topology, and coordinates into a single run input file for next step, e.g., protein_b4em.tpr as shown below. It is in binary format. Once the .tpr file is generated, it is possible that the simulation can be run from any computer/cluster.# grompp -f em.mdp -c  protein_water  -p  protein.top  -o protein_b4em.tprwhere,-f flag requires a parameter file, usually denoted as \u2018.mdp\u2019 file that can be obtained from Gromacs website (http://manual.gromacs.org/online/mdp.html).The generated .tpr file then passed into \u2018genion\u2019 command as shown below:# genion -s  protein_b4em.tpr -o protein_genion.gro -nn 3 -nq -1 -n index.ndxHere,The flag -s is used to input the pre-processed file generated by \u2018grompp\u2019,-o flag is to output after neutralizing the system,-nn for number of counter ions to be added,-nq for the charge of the ion (in case of positive ions -np 1 should be used).For example, in the case the system has a net charge of +3.00 . Therefore, it is needed to add three chloride ions to neutralize the overall charge. The index.ndx can be used to merge the groups and to setup up coupling groups, let\u2019s say \u2018Protein and Ligand\u2019 as one group.5.  Energy minimizationIn general, energy minimization is commonly used to refine low-resolution experimental structures and to remove steric hindrance that may be caused due to added hydrogen atoms. Gromacs supports different minimization algorithms: the most commonly used are steepest descent and conjugate gradient. The steepest descent algorithm is the quickest in removing the largest strains in the system but converges slowly when close to a minimum.The \u2018grompp\u2019 command processes and prepares the input file necessary for energy minimization run.# grompp -f em -c  protein_genion.gro  -p  protein.top   -o protein_em.tprOnce, the .tpr file is ready, submit the job for energy minimization by following command:# mdrun -s protein_em.tpr -e minim_ener.edr -o protein_em.trr  -c  protein_b4md.groHere the mdrun command is used to perform energy minimization. Mdrun reads the input file with -s flag and generates four output files after successful execution. The energy file (.edr) contains state variables temperature, pressure, etc., and much more information that can be used for further analysis of simulation data. The trajectory file is generated by specifying ^-0^ , flag and it contains coordinates and velocities. The structure file (-c) contains the final coordinates and velocities of the last step of MD simulations. A \u2018.log\u2019 file is generated by default. It is to be noted that the same mdrun command is used to perform final molecular dynamics simulations as well. However, the input parameter (.mdp) file needs to be edited accordingly. Note: There is another step called \u2018position restraining\u2019 before we go for final MD setup. The process is the same as in step 5. This is required to allow the water molecules to adjust with the protein system. Here we restrict the positions of protein atoms and allow the water molecules to flow. Position restraint run is not necessary for simulations in vacuo. The output of this is then passed into the \u2018mdrun\u2019 command, which actually performs the simulation.6.  MD simulationsNow we enter into the final phase of MD simulations. The parameter file (md.mdp) needs to be adjusted accordingly. The difference between position restraint run/equilibration and production run is minimal: For production run, the position restraints and pressure coupling are turned off and simulations are carried significantly longer, say 1ns to 1ms depends on the research question and availability of resources.grompp -f md.mdp -c  protein_b4md.gro  -p  protein  -o  protein _md.tprmdrun -nice 4 -s protein _md.tpr -o protein _md.trr  -g  md_log.log  -e  ener_protein_md.tpr     -c  protein _aft_md\u2013vHere \u2018-v\u2019 displays the live flow of execution on your monitor. After completing a simulation with \u2018mdrun\u2019, four output files are generated same as in earlier case; these are a trajectory file (.trr) and an energy file (.edr), structure file(.gro) and log (.log) file. These files can be used for further analysis. However, it is necessary to relax the system first before making the production run. Note: A most common issue with MD simulations run is abnormal termination of the job. The end user may tend to repeat the whole procedure. However, if the termination is due to power failure or queue limits etc., then the run can be continued from where it has stopped by using a command called \u2018tpbconv\u2019. Moreover, the same command can be used to extend the simulations further for more time period. The usage of tpbconv is similar to \u2018grompp\u2019. Instead of grompp, use \u2018tpbconv\u2019 command to produce input file required for mdrun. It is required to have the last checkpoint file \u2018.cpt\u2019 in order to extend the run.# tpbconv -s previous_md.tpr -extend (new time to be extended) -o new.tprThe command flags are same as in steps above. Now, issue the final mdrun command as shown below:mdrun -s new.tpr -cpiprevious_run.cpt -o protein_new_md.trr -g new_md_log.log-enew_ener  -c  protein _new_md\u2013vIn general the final mdrun is performed on computer cluster or super computer. The remote servers can be connected via ssh clients like putty from windows desktop machines and the file transfers can be performed by using WinSCP tool.\nObtain Protein Coordinates\nDownload the protein structure coordinate file in PDB format from the RCSB website.\nUse RasMol tool for visual inspection of the protein structure and graphics rendering.\nUse Gedit tool to open and edit the text files.\nPre-format the PDB File\nCheck for the presence of ligands or water molecules in the structure.\nExtract the coordinates of the ligand and separate it from the main PDB file if necessary.\nConstruct a separate topology for the ligand and add the information to the main topology file.\nRemove external water molecules from the PDB file if necessary.\nConvert PDB File to GROMACS Format\nUse the pdb2gmx command to convert the PDB file to a GROMACS specific molecular geometry file format (.GRO).\nSelect an appropriate force field for the simulations using the pdb2gmx command.\nGenerate a topology file with a.top extension using the pdb2gmx command.\nSetup Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)\nDefine a box (supercell) around the protein using the editconf command.\nSpecify the box edge and type (e.g., cubic, triclinic, dodecahedron) using the editconf command.\nKeep the protein in the center of the box using the -c flag.\nSolvate the Box\nUse the solvate command to add water molecules around the protein based on the box dimensions.\nUpdate the topology file to include the topology of water molecules.\nNeutralize the System\nUse the genion command to add counter ions according to the total charge of the system.\nGenerate a gromacs pre-processor file containing the atomic description and topology of the molecule.\nPreprocessing\nUse the grompp command to collect parameters, topology, and coordinates into a single run input file.\nGenerate a.tpr file in binary format.\nEnergy Minimization\nUse the grompp command to prepare the input file for energy minimization.\nSubmit the job for energy minimization using the mdrun command.\nGenerate output files including an energy file (.edr), trajectory file (.trr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).\nPosition Restraint Run (Optional)\nUse the grompp command to prepare the input file for position restraint run.\nSubmit the job for position restraint run using the mdrun command.\nGenerate output files including an energy file (.edr), trajectory file (.trr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).\nMD Simulations\nAdjust the parameter file (md.mdp) for production run.\nUse the grompp command to prepare the input file for MD simulations.\nSubmit the job for MD simulations using the mdrun command.\nGenerate output files including a trajectory file (.trr), energy file (.edr), structure file (.gro), and log file (.log).\nContinuing or Extending MD Simulations\nUse the tpbconv command to produce an input file for continuing or extending MD simulations.\nSubmit the job for continuing or extending MD simulations using the mdrun command."}, "consistency": {"doi_match": false, "title_sim": 0.0, "keyword_sim": 0.001, "action_overlap": 0.0, "material_overlap": 0.0, "param_coverage": 0.0, "section_list": ["Methods"], "sections_total_chars": 11768, "sections_total_tokens": 1778, "suspect_mismatch": true, "notes": ""}}

Forward and reverse primer pairs were designed to amplify the respective open reading frame in full. Forward primers contained a ribosomal binding site (RBS), optionally a Kozak sequence, a T7 promoter, a 6\u00d7 His epitope tag sequence, and a transcript-specific portion. Reverse primers were made of the V5 epitope sequence and a transcript-specific sequence; the presence of a T7 terminator sequence was found to be unnecessary. The Kozak sequence, which is important for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, was not added, if prokaryotic cell lysates were used for protein expression. Primers that were attached to solid support had a (dT)10 stretch at their 5\u2032-ends, which acted as a linker. Attachment to the epoxysilane-coated microarray surface occurred via an amino-group, which was chemically added during synthesis to the 5\u2032-end as part of a C6-linker. The fluorescent Cy5- or Cy3-label of oligonucleotides used for hybridisation was added during chemical synthesis. The actual oligonucleotide sequences are provided as Supplementary Materials information.Primer attachmentPrimer oligonucleotides were diluted to a concentration of 5 \u03bcM in 150 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.001% Tween 20. A volume of 1.5 nl was placed onto epoxysilane-coated slides (Nexterion E; Schott, Jena, Germany) using a NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-system (Gesim, Gro\u00dferkmannsdorf, Germany). Printed slides were kept at room temperature and 70% humidity for 24 h and stored dry for a minimum of two days before being used. Prior to the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction, the slides were blocked in superblock buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. The slides were washed three times in distilled water and spin dried in a swing-wing centrifuge.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was extracted from the respective biological material (tumour, chronic pancreatitis and healthy pancreatic tissues as well as the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca-2) using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by absorption measurement on a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany). The RNA was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or used immediately for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was produced from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA by means of the Protoscript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. One tenth of the product was used for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction.On-chip polymerase elongation reactionAn adhesive gene frame (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was fixed onto the microarray and filled with 25 \u03bcl of 1x Qiagen LongRange PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 100 ng DNA and 1 U LongRange PCR polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primer extension was done in a 16 \u00d7 16 dual-block PTC 200 thermocycler (BioRad, Munich, Germany) by initial heating to 93 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 93 \u00b0C for 45 s, 50 \u00b0C for 45 s, 68 \u00b0C for 3 min, and a final elongation step at 68 \u00b0C for 10 min. The microarrays were extensively washed with water to remove the PCR cocktail and dried using pressurised air.Detection of on-chip DNA-products by oligonucleotide hybridisationFluorescently (Cy3 or Cy5) labelled oligonucleotides were diluted to 1 \u03bcM in 3\u00d7 SSC (450 mM NaCl, 45 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.1% SDS. After 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, hybridisation was at 60 \u00b0C overnight. The microarrays were subsequently washed in 3\u00d7 SSC supplemented with 0.1% SDS, then in 3\u00d7 SSC and finally in 0.3\u00d7 SSC for 10 min each. The arrays were briefly rinsed with water and dried with pressurised air. The signal intensities were detected on a Power Scanner (Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland).Detection of on-chip DNA-products by PCR in solutionThe microarrays were extensively washed with water and dried. Adhesive gene frames (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed on the microarrays and filled in with 1x Qiagen PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 \u03bcM of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). However, no DNA template was added but for the DNA present on the microarray spots. The amplification reaction was performed as described for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction. The PCR-products in the supernatant were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. As a negative control, spots were used on which there was no DNA-template.In situ cell-free protein expressionFor protein expression, slides with PCR-products were washed twice in 1xSSC for 5 min and dried. Multiple spotting (MIST) was used for in situ cell-free expression as described in detail before11. In short, the slides were placed into the NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-element system (Gesim) in the same orientation they had been during primer spotting. First, 0.6 nl of 0.5 M betaine was spotted onto the position of each PCR-product, followed by 2.1 nl of S30 T7 High-Yield Protein Expression System (Promega, Madison, USA). In a humidified chamber, the slides were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently at 30 \u00b0C overnight. After washing, the microarrays were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h before use. Usually, we use a density of about 2,000 proteins per slide of 7 \u00d7 2 cm. At higher densities, there is a higher risk that the individual droplets, in which the reactions take place, may get in contact, thus causing contamination. However, spot density can be adapted to the respective requirements.Protein detectionSypro Ruby stainingFor a quick determination of overall array quality, protein microarrays were incubated with Sypro Ruby staining solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting luminescence signal is equivalent to the amount of protein present at each location.Antibody detectionFor a more detailed analysis, expressed proteins were detected with directly fluorescence-labelled antibodies that recognise the N-terminal 6xHis epitope (Penta-His Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate; Qiagen) or the C-terminal V5 epitope (monoclonal anti-V5-Cy3; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). In addition, protein-specific monoclonal antibodies were used (e.g., anti-CDK2, clone AN4.3 and anti-P53, clone DO-1; Sigma-Aldrich). The microarrays were blocked with 2% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (137 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 10.0 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.76 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min. Blocking with 2% BSA was required so as to cover the regions in between protein spots, since otherwise the labelled antibodies would bind preferentially to these areas. There was very little unspecific binding to the actual protein spots even without blocking, but the blocking does not harm specific binding events. After washing the arrays surface in PBST three times, antibody incubation was in PBST, 2% BSA at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 1 h. While 0.1 \u03bcg/ml binder was used for epitope tag detection, protein-specific antibodies had a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml. For detection of the latter, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and incubated with a 1:10.000 dilution of fluorescent dye conjugated secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Cy5-conjugated antibody; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) for another hour. Finally, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and air-dried in a ventilated oven.DARPin targetsTarget proteins were enzymatically biotinylated using the ImmunoProbe Biotinylation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation of 5 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated protein on the DARPin array, detection was performed with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-Etravidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h.Data acquisition and analysisFor signal detection, microarrays were scanned on a Power Scanner (Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). In all measurements, the instrument\u2019s laser power and photomultiplier tube were adjusted to avoid signal saturation. The scanner settings were kept identical for all arrays of an experimental series. Relevant parameters, such as concordance of the two colour detection channels, were carefully validated throughout. Spot segmentation was performed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Union City, USA). The mean local background intensity was subtracted from the mean signal intensity for each spot to obtain background-corrected signal intensities. Data were analysed using the linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) package20 of R-Bioconductor. For normalisation, a specialised invariant Lowess method was applied21."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Assessment of TCR-induced Sumoylation of PKC-\u03b8", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1979", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Cell Preparation and Cell Culture"}, "1.1": {"title": "Blood Dilution and Ficoll Layering"}, "1.1.1": "Dilute 500ml blood with 500ml HBSS.", "1.1.2": "Carefully layer 35ml of diluted blood over 15ml of Ficoll in a 50ml conical tube.", "1.2": {"title": "Centrifugation and Mononuclear Cell Layer Separation"}, "1.2.1": "Centrifuge at 350\u00d7g for 40 minutes at 25\u00b0C in a swinging-bucket rotor without brake.", "1.2.2": "Aspirate the upper layer leaving the mononuclear cell layer undisturbed.", "1.3": {"title": "Mononuclear Cell Layer Transfer and Washing"}, "1.3.1": "Carefully transfer the mononuclear cell layer to a new 50ml conical tube.", "1.3.2": "Fill the tube with HBSS, mix, and centrifuge at 300xg for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C.", "1.4": {"title": "Cell Pellet Resuspension and Centrifugation"}, "1.4.1": "Carefully remove supernatant.

The selected TSC patients were reported with mental retardation and seizures along with other TSC-related abnormalities. iPSC reprogramming was done based on polycistronic construct with OCT3/4, c-MYC, SOX2, and KLF4 (Warlich et al., 2011). All the iPSC lines were cultured in Essential 8 medium (Gibco) on Geltrex LDEV-free (Gibco). Generation of in-direct contact iPSC-neuronal mono-cultures was performed as described earlier (Nadadhur et al., 2017) with slight modifications. Neuronal mono-cultures with a density of 62.5 K/2.0 cm2 in the Std condition medium contained Neurobasal composition with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (20 ng/mL; Peprotech) and cAMP (1 \u03bcM; Sigma). The Std + IGF-1 and Std + Rapa conditions contained Std medium with IGF-1 (10 ng/mL; Peprotech) or Rapa (30 nM; Sigma), respectively. For detailed culturing methods and culture conditions for MEA experiments please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Glial Cells and Co-culturesOLs were obtained as described previously (Izrael et al., 2007). Before neuron-OL co-cultures were generated, we first separately created neuron mono-cultures (62.5 K/2.0 cm2 density) until day 37 (Nadadhur et al., 2017) and OL progenitors until day 65. To generate neuron-OL co-cultures, the neuronal coverslips were removed from rat astrocyte feeder plates and OL progenitors were passaged with Accutase (Millipore) and plated at a density of 200 K/2.0 cm2 on neuronal coverslips. The co-cultures were maintained in Std co-culture medium (DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal [1:1; both Gibco], 1% N1 supplement [in-house], 2% B27 supplement [Gibco], 1% NEAA [Gibco], 60 ng/mL T3 [Sigma], 100 ng/mL Biotin [Sigma] medium with NT3 [10 ng/mL; Peprotech], mouse laminin [1 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma], BDNF [20 ng/mL], and cAMP [1 \u03bcM]). From day 1 to 7 of co-culture, all cells were refreshed with Std medium. From day 8 to 28 of co-culture, cells were refreshed with either Std, Std + Guana (5 \u03bcM; Sigma) or Std + Rapa (10 nM) medium twice a week. At day 28 of co-culture, the cell culture coverslips were processed for immunocytochemistry.Calcium ImagingAt day 56, neuronal mono-culture coverslips were incubated with Fluo-5-AM ester 1 \u03bcM in Neurobasal medium without growth factors for 5 min at 37\u00b0C and imaged under constant perfusion at 0.5 mL/min rate with Tyrode's solution (119 NaCl. 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 30 glucose; all in mM) in an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss) using a 40\u00d7 oil objective (numerical aperture 1.3; Zeiss), a Polychrome IV light source (TILL Photonics), a 488/6 nm excitation filter (Semrock), a 525/50-nm emission filter (Semrock), and a 500-nm beam splitter (Semrock). Images (1 image/s) were acquired using a Cascade 512 EM-CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and Metamorph 6.2 software (Molecular Devices). The total length of 4.5 min was recorded per FOV, and a minimum of five FOVs per coverslip was recorded each from two to four differentiations for three controls and three TSC lines. For analysis, image series were stacked using z stack projection in ImageJ, and regions of interest were placed on a minimum of 12 neurites per FOV. Calcium traces were detected using \u201cevent detection analysis (EVA)\u201d with previously described methods in MATLAB (Hjorth et al., 2016).MEA60MEA200/30iR-Tigr MEAs were used. Spontaneous activity was recorded, for a period of 10 min, every 10 days at 37\u00b0C using MC Rack at a sample rate of 25,000 Hz. Electrode data were filtered online with a 200 Hz high pass and a 5,000 Hz low pass filter (both second-order Butterworth). Data were stored as .mcd files, which contain the filtered continuous traces for each electrode together with the spikes detected using the online threshold detection built into MC Rack. After selecting electrodes for analysis, chosen data were converted to asci files for offline analysis using the MC Data tool. Offline analysis was achieved with custom scripts written in MATLAB. Spikes were detected from filtered data using an automatic threshold-based method set at \u22125.5\u00d7\u03c3, where \u03c3 is an estimate of the noise of each electrode. Spike timestamps were analyzed to provide statistics on the general excitability of cultures. The average spike rate (Hz) represents the median of the average spike rate for all electrodes (AvgSpkRateE1-n). The average spike rate for each electrode (AvgSpkRateE) was calculated as AvgSpkRateE = number of spikes/tmax, where tmax is the total length of the recording in seconds. This is used to control for particularly high or low firing rates.ImmunofluorescenceFor immunocytochemistry, neuronal mono-cultures and neuron-OL co-culture coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min and processed for staining. For immunohistochemistry, slides were washed with PBS (6 times for 5 min each in PBS 1\u00d7), optionally treated for 2 min with citrate buffer (0.01 M [pH 6]) for antigen retrieval, followed by washing in PBS (5 min for 1 time). All the coverslips/slides were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in blocking buffer (5% NGS, 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS 1\u00d7), incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next day, after washing again with PBS (6 times for 5 min each), the coverslips/slides were incubated with secondary antibody solution for 2 hr, washed again (6\u00d7 for 5 min), and then mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) on glass slides (VWR; Super frost plus)/glass coverslips. Images were acquired from stained slides using either a Carl Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope with 40\u00d7 (1.2 numerical aperture) oil objective or a Leica DM6000B fluorescent microscope with 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, and 40\u00d7 magnification. For details of primary antibodies used please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Cell Property AnalysisCell properties such as axonal density, dendritic density, soma size, and the number of synapses; OLIG2- and MBP-positive cells were measured using Columbus 2.5 online software. Precisely, images acquired with confocal and fluorescent microscope were analyzed with algorithms for morphology, soma recognition, and co-localization tools using pixel density measurement and the number of objects present, respectively. To quantify the soma sizes and morphological parameters, pixel densities were measured in each FOV (6\u201310 per condition/coverslip) with images of 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 magnification. To quantify dendritic branching, the NeurophologyJ tool was used in ImageJ.Western Blot AnalysisCell lysates were collected from feeder-free iPSCs at day 3 or 4 after passage and from neuroepithelial stem cells between P1 and P5. SDS-PAGE was run on Bolt 4%\u201312% Bis-Tris Plus Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween, followed by primary antibody incubations at 1:1,000 concentration in 5% BSA in TBS-0.05% Tween and incubated ON at 4\u00b0C (primary antibodies are listed in Supplement Information). The blots were then washed thrice for 10 min with TBS-Tween and incubated with secondary antibody in milk-TBS-Tween for 1 hr at RT. After washing thrice again, bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific) on Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR). Primary antibodies against TSC1 (no. 6935) and TSC2 (no. 4308; both from Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1,000 concentrations. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase rabbit antibody (1:1,000; no. 7074S, Cell Signaling Technology).Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 software. All the raw data were tested for normal distribution and then analyzed using unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA, depending on group numbers. In cases where significant differences were obtained in the ANOVA (p < 0.05), a Tukey's post hoc test was performed."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Extraction and Quantification of Tryptophan and Kynurenine from Cultured Cells and Media Using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System Equipped with an Ultra-sensitive Diode Array Detector", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1781", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Tryptophan and Kynurenine Extraction Overview"}, "1.1": "The protocol requires a minimum of 1\u00d710^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels.", "1.2": "If tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect 2 mL of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80\u00b0C.", "2": {"title": "Cell Collection and Media Preparation"}, "2.1": "If cells of interest are adherent cells, proceed to step A2a.

The protocol requires a minimum of 1\u00d710^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels. If tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect _2 m of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80^\u00b0C . This sample will be used to measure the baseline levels of tryptophan and kynurenine in the media.2.  If cells of interest are adherent cells, then proceed to step A2a. If cells of interest are suspension cells, then proceed to step A2b. If desired, the cell culture can be spiked with an internal standard such as 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (a final concentration of 20-50~uM is generally appropriate) at this time. The internal standard can be used to quantify metabolite recovery.a.  At the completion of the treatment schedule, collect 2 ml media in _2~scriptsize~m~ microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000xg at 4~^\u00b0C in centrifuge to pellet cells/debris from the media. Without disturbing the pellet, transfer media into two labeled tubes of equal volume. One will be used for immediate analysis while the other will serve as a backup. At this point, cell-free, centrifuged culture media can be stored at -80~^\u00b0C until analysis. Media can be analyzed by HPLC without the need for extraction. Next, aspirate off remaining media in plate/flask where cells are grown. Wash cells with cold (4~^\u00b0C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Afterwards, dislodge cells from culture plate/flask by scraping. Collect liberated cells and place into _2m l microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 xg at 4^\u00b0C in centrifuge. Proceed to step A3.b.  At the completion of the treatment schedule, collect all media containing cells into appropriate volume conical tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g at 4^\u00b0C in centrifuge to pellet cells/debris from media. Without disturbing the pellet, transfer 1~ml of media into two labeled tubes. One will be used for immediate analysis while the other willserve as a backup. At this point, cell-free, centrifuged culture media can be stored at -80~^\u00b0C until analysis. Media can be analyzed by HPLC without the need for extraction. Next, wash pelleted cells with cold (4~^\u00b0C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Proceed to step A3.3.  Centrifuge cells at 2,000\u00d7 g at 4^\u00b0C and aspirate PBS without disturbing the cell pellet. Keep cells on ice while pipetting PBS. To quench metabolism and extract metabolites, add 200ul ice-cold 50% methanol 150% PIPES-EDTA to the cell pellet.4.  To the quenched cell mixture, add 200ul ice-cold chloroform and vortex vigorously for45 min at -20 \u00b00 . (Note: This extraction length is important when extracting metabolites from organisms with cell walls including bacteria and yeast. A shorter extraction time of 5-10 min is adequate for mammalian cells. Vigorous vortexing is most effective for metabolite extraction. Use of a multi-tube vortex mixer head is recommended.) Afterwards, centrifuge at 21000\u00d7 g at 4^\u00b0C for 10m i n .5.  Collect upper, water/methanol phase in a clean labeled tube. This is the first metabolite extract. Place tube on ice.6.  Re-extract the chloroform phase by adding 200~ul of ice-cold 50% methanol/ 50% PIPES-EDTA. Vortex for 1 min and centrifuge again at 21, 100xg at 4^\u00b0C for 10m i n .7.  Just as before collect the upper, water/methanol with the extract from step A5. Freeze the extract until analysis.B.  Detection and quantification of tryptophan and kynurenine1.  Analyze metabolites from cell culture media and from cell extracts by HPLC. To separate and quantify tryptophan and kynurenine, inject 5-20~uI (Note: The required injection volume will vary depending on the concentration of metabolite in the sample and is a recommended range.) of the cell extract obtained from step A7, spent culture media collected in step A2, or the cell-free media collected from step A1 in an HPLC equipped with an ultra-sensitive diode array detector and a Hypersil GOLD C18 column ^50\u00d72.1 m m, 3um ), which is a reverse phase column packed with spherical, fully porous ultrapure silica. Set column temperature to be maintained at 30~^\u00b0C . Use an isocratic mobile phase of 15~m M potassium phosphate (p H6.4) , with 2.7% (v/v) acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0.8m l/m i n . The run time should be set for 10 min.2.  Quantify the area under the peaks that display absorbance at 286 nm and 360~n m to calculate the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine, respectively, in the samples. Generate standard curves ranging from 0 to 200~uM for both tryptophan andkynurenine and other metabolites of interest as well as any internal standard (if applicable) using authentic standards. Standards of each concentration should be prepared in triplicate and measured in triplicate. A recipe for a standard mix is included in the Recipes section.# bio-protocolNote: Details of standard curve generation will vary depending on the chromatography system and data analysis software used. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s documentation to generate a standard curve with your instrument\u2019s software.\nTryptophan and Kynurenine Extraction Overview\nThe protocol requires a minimum of 1\u00d710^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels.\nIf tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect 2 mL of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80\u00b0C.\nCell Collection and Media Preparation\nIf cells of interest are adherent cells, proceed to step A2a.

To extract genomic DNA, fungal tissue was cultured in potato dextrose broth (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 24 \u00b0C in the dark for 2 days. The genomic DNA of MAFF 305635-RFP was extracted from fungal tissue using CTAB and Qiagen Genomic-tip 500/G (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described for the 1,000 fungal genomes project (http://1000.fungalgenomes.org; last accessed on April 26, 2019). Genomic DNA was extracted from other strains using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR to detect genes on minichromosomes and highly variable effector candidate genes with presence/absence polymorphisms was performed using KOD FX Neo (Toyobo, Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primers are listed in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online. Fungal strains for infection assays were grown on potato dextrose agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 24 \u00b0C for 12 h under black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions for 1 week.Genome Sequencing and AssemblyWhole genome shotgun sequences were obtained using a PacBio RSII sequencer (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). The filtered subreads (3.47-Gb, 65\u00d7 average coverage) from three single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells were assembled using the RS_HGAP_Assembly.2 protocol in SMRT Analysis v2.3.0 by setting the estimated genome size to 53.4 Mb, which is the reported genome size of C. higginsianum IMI 349063 (O\u2019Connell et al. 2012). This whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number MWPZ00000000. The version described in this article is version MWPZ01000000. To evaluate the coverage of gene-coding regions in the assembly, BUSCO v3.0.2 (Sim\u00e3o et al. 2015) was utilized to search Pezizomycotina universal single-copy orthologs using default settings. Additional SOLiD reads were generated from the MAFF 305635 wild-type strain (BioProject accession: PRJNA352900). Genomic DNA for preparing this library was obtained as described by Gan et al. (2013). Genomic sequencing was performed using a SOLiD3 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a 600\u2013800-base pair (bp) insert mate-paired library with 50-bp read lengths. A total of 109,156,072 paired-reads were generated.Gene Prediction and Functional AnnotationThe BRAKER1 (Hoff et al. 2016) pipeline was utilized for gene prediction using the ab initio gene predictors Augustus-3.1.0 (Stanke et al. 2006) and GeneMark-ET v.4.30 (Lomsadze et al. 2014) with additional evidence from transcriptome data derived from IMI 349063 published by O\u2019Connell et al. (2012) (SRR364392.sra, SRR364393.sra, RR364394.sra, SRR364395.sra, SRR364396.sra, SRR364397.sra, SRR364398.sra, SRR364399.sra, SRR364400.sra, SRR364401.sra, SRR364402.sra, SRR364403.sra, SRR364404.sra, SRR364405.sra, SRR364406.sra, SRR364407.sra, SRR364408.sra, and SRR364409.sra). RNA-seq reads were aligned to the MAFF 305635-RFP assembly using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.6 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) and TopHat2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al. 2013) with the default settings for both programs. These programs were also utilized for gene prediction. Some gene structures were manually corrected by referring to closely related fungal species. To examine the conservation of IMI 349063 minichromosome-encoded genes in MAFF 305635-RFP, reciprocal best hit analysis was performed with BlastP (cutoff E-value = 10\u22126) as described by Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer (2008) using all the predicted protein sequences from both strains. Only MAFF 305635-RFP proteins that were reciprocal best hits of proteins encoded by genes located on the minichromosomes of IMI 349063 were considered as potential homologs of minichromosome genes.Whole-Genome AlignmentsWhole-genome alignments were performed with nucmer in MUMmer 3.23 (Kurtz et al. 2004) using \u2013mumreference (default settings). To remove spurious hits, the alignments were subsequently filtered by length, retaining alignments with \u226599% identity and \u226515 kb referring to Faino et al. (2016). Shared genomic regions were calculated after combining overlaps in aligned regions using BEDTools version 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the merge option. Strain-specific regions were defined as genomic regions that were not aligned to the other genome after filtering. To confirm large-scale rearrangements, PacBio and SOLiD reads were mapped using SMRT analysis v2.3.0 and CLC Genomics Workbench8 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark), respectively, using the default settings for both programs and visually examined using Integrated Genome Browser 9.0.1 (Freese et al. 2016). Whole-genome alignments were also performed in three additional fungal pathogenic fungi, V.dahliae (VdLs17 and JR2) (Faino et al. 2015), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (4287 and D11) (Ayhan et al. 2018), and M.oryzae (BTJP4-1 and BR32) (Win et al. 2019). Mapping analysis using Illumina MiSeq reads derived from MAFF 305635 wild-type (CK7444), vir-49, and vir-51 generated by Plaumann et al. (2018) (.fastq accessions: SAMN08226879, SAMN08226880, and SAMN08226881) was performed using Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) with default settings.Prediction of Transposable ElementsTransposable elements (TEs) were predicted as described by Castanera et al. (2016). TEs in the two C. higginsianum genome assemblies were predicted using RECON version 1.08 (Bao and Eddy 2002), RepeatScout version 1.0.5 (Price et al. 2005) (integrated into the RepeatModeler pipeline), and LTRharvest from GenomeTools-1.5.9 (Ellinghaus et al. 2008) with default settings for all programs. The results from LTRharvest were used as queries for BlastN (cutoff E-value = 10\u221215) against the genome assembly and for BlastX (cutoff E-value = 10\u22125) against the Repbase peptide database (downloaded on February 1, 2014) (Bao et al. 2015). Only sequences longer than 400 bp with more than five copies or yielding a significant hit to the described sequences in Repbase were further analyzed. The outputs from the genome assemblies of the two strains using the three programs were merged and identical sequences were eliminated using USEARCH v9.1.13 (Edgar 2010) with the -fastx_uniques option. The obtained sequences were clustered at 80% similarity using USEARCH v9.1.13 with the -cluster_smallmem option to create a custom TE library. Consensus sequences in the library were classified using BlastX (cutoff E-value = 10\u22125) against the Repbase peptide database, and the final libraries were used as input for RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org; last accessed on November 25, 2016). Consensus sequences without similarity to any Repbase entry were removed from the library. RepeatMasker outputs were parsed using the One_code_to_find_them_all version 1.0 (Bailly-Bechet et al. 2014) to reconstruct TE fragments into full-length copies. Among the reconstructed fragments of TEs, those longer than 400 bp were used for analysis. To perform Monte Carlo tests, 1,000 trials to model TEs randomly located on the genome were generated using BEDTools version 2.25.0 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the shuffle -noOverlapping option. Overlap between TEs and strain-specific regions were calculated using BEDTools version 2.25.0 with the coverage option. As the default settings of nucmer ignores nonunique sequences in the reference, to analyze regions regardless of their uniqueness in the reference strain, we repeated nucmer with the \u2013maxmatch settings and redefined strain-specific regions. Then, Monte Carlo tests were repeated as described above.Analysis of Genome CompartmentalizationFlanking intergenic regions (FIRs) were calculated using R scripts as described by Saunders et al. (2014). Two-dimensional plots were created by referring to Frantzeskakis et al. (2018). Distances from genes to the nearest TEs were calculated using BEDTools version 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the closest -D a -iu -a or -D a -id -a option. Fungal universal single-copy orthologs in the two strains were identified as the best hits from BlastP (cutoff E-value = 10\u22125) results using fungi_odb9 sequences provided in BUSCO v3.0.2 (Sim\u00e3o et al. 2015) as queries and C. higginsianum predicted proteomes as references. For synteny analysis, Easyfig 2.2.2 (Sullivan et al. 2011) was used with an identity cutoff of 70%.Comparative Secretome AnalysisTo predict secreted proteins, SignalP 4.1 (Petersen et al. 2011), TMHMM 2.0 (Krogh et al. 2001), and big-PI Fungal Predictor (Eisenhaber et al. 2004) were used with the default settings. In this study, effector candidate proteins were defined as predicted secreted proteins (with a signal peptide present but no transmembrane domains and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchors) with lengths of <300 amino acids. To assess the overlap between effectors predicted with our pipeline and those predicted by the effector prediction programs EffectorP 1.0 and 2.0 (Sperschneider et al. 2016, 2018), we ran both versions of EffectorP using the default settings. To examine whether effector candidates show similarity to known proteins, BlastP analysis using the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded at October 22, 2016) was performed (cutoff E-value = 10\u22125). To detect variations in effector candidates, the protein sequences of effector candidates from each strain were queried against the genome assembly of the other strain using exonerate version 2.2.0 (Slater and Birney 2005) with the protein2genome option. Query coverage values of homologous sequences were calculated by reciprocally performing BlastP between effector candidates and exonerate-predicted protein sequences. The results were inspected and manually corrected. A dendrogram based on the presence/absence patterns of highly variable effector candidate genes was drawn using the R package heatmap.2 from gplots v3.0.1.Conservation Patterns of Highly Variable Effector Candidate GenesThe details of the genome and proteome sequences of 25 ascomycetes used in this analysis are shown in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online. To identify orthogroups containing highly variable effector candidates among the 25 ascomycetes, orthoMCL v2.0.9 (Li et al. 2003) was used with an E-value = 10\u22125 as the threshold and inflation value of 1.5. The alignment of CH35J_007515, CH35J_007516, and their homologs was generated using protein sequences with their predicted signal peptides removed. Sequence alignments were performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench8 (CLC bio).Phylogenetic AnalysesThe phylogenetic tree to classify 16 C. higginsianum strains was generated based on the combined alignments of actin (ACT), chitin synthase I (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone H3 (HIS3), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and tubulin-2 (TUB2). This tree was drawn using previously identified sequences from other species in the Colletotrichumdestructivum complex (Damm et al. 2014). The DNA sequences of 16 strains were determined by direct Sanger sequencing of PCR products amplified with KOD -Plus- Neo (Toyobo) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primers are listed in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online. The phylogenetic tree of 25 ascomycetes was generated based on the combined alignments of single gene orthogroups conserved in all 25 ascomycetes obtained from the orthoMCL results. For both trees, DNA or protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7.215 (Katoh et al. 2002) with the auto setting and trimmed using trimAL v1.2 (Capella-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2009) with the automated1 settings. The concatenated trimmed alignments were then utilized to estimate the maximum-likelihood species phylogeny with RAxML version 8.2.11 (Stamatakis 2014) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To generate the maximum-likelihood tree of species in the C. destructivum complex, the GTRCAT model was used. To generate the maximum-likelihood tree of 25 ascomycetes, PROTGAMMAAUTO was used to find the best protein substitution model and autoMRE was used to determine the appropriate number of bootstrap samples. Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences were used as the outgroup in this tree. Trees were visualized using iTOL version 4.1 (Letunic and Bork 2016).Infection AssaysPlants were grown at 22 \u00b0C with a 10-h photoperiod for 4 weeks. Three leaves per plant were inoculated with 5-\u03bcl droplets of conidial suspensions at 5 \u00d7 105 conidia ml\u22121. Plants were maintained at 22 \u00b0C with a 10-h photoperiod under 100% humidity conditions after inoculation. The symptoms were observed at 6 days after inoculation and lesion areas were measured using the color threshold function in ImageJ 1.51k (Schneider et al. 2012) using the following settings: Hue, 0\u2013255; saturation, 110\u2013140; and brightness, 0\u2013255 with a square region of interest."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Super-resolution Imaging of Live BY2 Cells Using 3D-structured Illumination", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1697", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Sample Preparation"}, "1.1": {"title": "Cell Culture"}, "1.1.1": "Culture 40ml of BY2 cell lines stably expressing a fluorescent reporter in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks with sterile Murashige and Skoog Basal Salts media supplemented with 3% sucrose and 2ug/ml 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.", "1.1.2": "Grow cultures at 28\u00b0C, in the dark, on an orbital shaker at 140 rpm.", "1.1.3": "Aseptically sub-culture cells to fresh media weekly using a dilution of 1ml of cells to 40ml of media.", "1.2": {"title": "Cell Staining"}, "1.2.1": "Pipette 1ml of cells into an Eppendorf tube and stain cell walls (if required) with a final concentration of 3.5ug/ml Calcofluor white for 5 minutes at room temperature.", "1.2.2": "Remove excess stain by allowing the cells to settle to the bottom of the tube and exchanging the media for fresh, twice.", "1.3": {"title": "Plasmolysis"}, "1.3.1": "Plasmolyse cells by removing 450ul of media and replacing it with 450ul of 1 M Mannitol.", "1.3.2": "Note: Plasmolysis is not required, but enables observation of plasmodesmata more accurately.", "1.4": {"title": "Cell Preparation for Imaging"}, "1.4.1": "Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes, gently inverting the tube every 2 minutes to keep cells in suspension.", "1.4.2": "Pipette 40ul of cells onto a microscope slide and lay a rectangular coverslip gently on top.", "1.4.3": "Remove excess media by gentle pressure using a folded flat piece of absorbent tissue paper.", "1.5": {"title": "Coverslip Sealing and Imaging"}, "1.5.1": "Seal all edges of the coverslip with nail varnish.", "1.5.2": "Begin imaging as soon as the varnish has dried.", "2": {"title": "Cell Location and Fluorescence Check"}, "2.1": {"title": "Cell Location"}, "2.1.1": "Locate candidate cells for imaging using a PersonalDV DeltaVision live-cell imaging system.", "2.1.2": "Use low-level bright field illumination and mark the position on the slide using the point visiting tool.", "2.2": {"title": "Fluorescence Check"}, "2.2.1": "Expose all marked cells to the appropriate wavelength of fluorescent light to check the calcofluor stain.", "2.2.2": "Check that the cells are expressing a good level of fluorescent reporter.", "3": {"title": "3D-SIM Imaging"}, "3.1": {"title": "OMX Setup"}, "3.1.1": "Acquire 3D-SIM images using a DeltaVision OMX Blaze fitted with an Olympus PlanApo N 100x 1.42 NA oil objective.", "3.1.2": "Place the slide on the OMX and apply immersion oil.", "3.1.3": "Adjust the type of immersion oil to match the Refractive Index (RI) of the sample and imaging depth.", "3.2": {"title": "Cell Centering and Z-Stack Determination"}, "3.2.1": "Find the selected cells using the Point List and then the Spiral Mosaic function to center the cell in the image.", "3.2.2": "Determine the top and bottom limits of the z-stack quickly and efficiently, continuing to minimize the cell's exposure to light.", "3.3": {"title": "Image Acquisition"}, "3.3.1": "Select the lowest possible laser power and exposure times for each channel to minimize photo bleaching.", "3.3.2": "Adjust exposure times and laser power to achieve optimal intensities.", "3.3.3": "Acquire the image stack.", "3.4": {"title": "Image Reconstruction"}, "3.4.1": "Reconstruct super-resolution 3D image stacks with SoftWoRx 6.0 using channel-specific OTFs and Wiener filter setting of 0.002.", "3.4.2": "Adjust images from the different color channels with the SoftWorx 6.0 alignment tool."}, "text_flat": "Super-resolution Imaging of Live BY2 Cells Using 3D-structured Illumination\n\n1.

Culture 40ml of BY2 cell lines stably expressing a fluorescent reporter in 250~m~l~ Erlenmeyer flasks with sterile Murashige and Skoog Basal Salts media supplemented with 3% sucrose and 2u gm l^-12,4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Grow cultures at 28^\u00b0C , in the dark, on an orbital shaker at 140 rpm. Aseptically sub-culture cells to fresh media weekly using a dilution of 1~ml of cells to 40 mI of media. Healthy cultures are pale yellow to light beige in colour and there should be sufficient growth that the cell suspension is more viscous than the media (Figure 1).2.  At 4 days post-subculture, pipette 1~ml of cells into an Eppendorf tube and then stain cell walls (if required) with a final concentration of 3.5ug m^-1 Calcofluor white for 5 min at room temperature. Excess stain is removed by allowing the cells to settle to the bottom of the tube and exchanging the media for fresh, twice.3.  Plasmolyse cells by removing 450~ul of media and replacing it with 450~ul of 1 M Mannitol. Note: Plasmolysis is not required, but enabled us to observe plasmodesmata more accurately.4.  Incubate at room temperature for 10min , gently inverting the tube every 2 min to keep cells in suspension and then pipette 40~ul of cells onto a microscope slide. Lay a rectangular coverslip gently on top. Remove excess media by gentle pressure using a folded flat piece of absorbent tissue paper. Note: It is important not to damage the cells, so the pressure must be light.5.  Seal all edges of the coverslip with nail varnish and begin imaging as soon as the varnish has dried.6.  Locate candidate cells for imaging using a PersonalDV DeltaVision live-cell imaging system, which has stage coordinates mapped to the OMX. Use low level bright field illumination and mark the position on the slide using point visiting tool.7.  Expose all marked cells to the appropriate wavelength of fluorescent light to check the calcofluor stain (a b s350~ n m/e m455~ n m) has worked well and that the cells areexpressing a good level of fluorescent reporter (Figure 2). It is vital to keep this exposure as brief as possible in order to minimize bleaching prior to 3D-SIM imaging. The point visiting function allows the marked cells to be found swiftly on the OMX, thus avoiding unnecessary exposure to light.# B.  3D-SIM Imaging1.  We acquire 3D-SIM images using a DeltaVision OMX Blaze fitted with an Olympus PlanApo N 100x 1.42 NA oil objective. The 3D-SIM imaging protocol is based on that described in Schermelleh et al. (2010). Place the slide on the OMX and apply immersion oil. To minimise spherical aberration and optimize illumination modulation contrast, adjust the type of immersion oil to match the Refractive Index (RI) of the sample and imaging depth. Ideally, BY2 cells would be mounted in glycerol or similar to maintain the RI of the oil immersion objective but to keep the ER in good condition the cells must be mounted in media. Cells also need to be as close to the coverslip as possible.2.  Find the selected cells using the Point List and then the Spiral Mosaic function to center the cell in the image. Determine top and bottom limits of z-stack quickly and efficiently, continuing to minimize the cell\u2019s exposure to light.3.  In the OMX 3D-SIM system, light from solid state lasers (405, 488 and 564 nm), shuttered by high speed tilt mirrors and coupled into a broadband single mode optical fiber is split into three beams. 3D-interference patterns in the sample plane are generated by focusing the beams onto the back focal plane of the objective lens. Striped illumination patterns are shifted by five phase steps and rotated by 3 angles (-60^\u00b0 , 0^\u00b0 and +60^\u00b0 ), providing a set of 15 images per unprocessed z-section. Interference patterns are phase shifted by directing the outer two beams through a separate pair of windows with individual tilt control. Phase of the interference pattern at the sample plane is shifted due to the change in the path length for the respective outer beam, while lateral refractive beam translation is canceled by tilting a given window pair in complementary directions. Angles of pattern orientation are shifted by a tilt mirror, directing the three beams pattern to one of three mirror clusters; the beam pattern from each of the three rotation paths is redirected back to a common exit path by reflecting a second time from the tilt mirror.

Adjust exposure times similarly, typically between 100 and 200 ms, and also adjust the power of each laser to achieve optimal intensities of between 1,000 and 3,000 counts in a raw image acquired by a 15-bit dynamic range Edge sCMOS camera.

Genomic data for around 1000 cell lines are available for public access and use. To be precise, National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) legacy archive hosts RNA sequencing data for 935 cell lines, whole exome sequencing (WES) data for 326 cell lines and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for 12 cell lines (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). The names of cell lines are used as is listed in NCI GDC archive and are listed in Additional file 1. We were able to download the RNA-seq bam files for all cell lines except one cell line named \u2018G27228.A101D.1\u2019 and whole exome sequencing bam files for all 326 cell lines. These bam files were processed using our in-house pipeline for variant calling. Variant calling process included removal of duplicate reads (samtools [21] and picard [https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard]), followed by local re-alignment and re-calibration of base quality scores (GATK [22]), and finally variant calling using VarScan [23] which includes both SNP and Indels. Downstream filtering (region-based to only include exome regions, sufficient coverage, and detectable allele frequency) and all other analyses were done using in-house Perl and MATLAB scripts. No filtering based on mutation types (specific to missense, nonsense or frameshift indels) or allele types (such as bi-allelic) were applied to CCLE samples. An illustrative depiction of the overall pipeline is shown in Fig. 1a. CCLE gene expression data were collected from (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/data) and it contains RPKM values for all the genes in 1019 cell lines, covering all 935 CCLE RNA-seq set.Independent RNA-seq datasetsWe also used two publicly available RNA-seq datasets from GEO as independent test sets. First one is comprised of 12 MCF7 cell lines (GSE86316) whereas the second one has data for eight HCT116 cell lines (GSE101966) [24, 25]. These were generated to profile mRNA expression levels in MCF7 cells after silencing or chemical inhibition of MEN1 [24] and in HCT116 cells after loss of ARID1A and ARID1B [25], respectively. We downloaded the fastq files for all these samples; aligned using RSEM [26] to align all reads to UCSC hg19 transcriptome, followed by variant calling using pipeline described earlier (Fig. 1a). We purposefully used a different aligner, RSEM [26], here to check the effect of different read aligners.Correlation and hierarchical clusteringTo assess the confirmation of two cell-lines to be either identical or highly similar in terms of their sequence variation profiles genome-wide or their expression levels, we choose to use Pearson Correlation to evaluate altered allele frequencies (FREQ) across two cell-lines or expression levels, facilitated by the number of non-zero FREQ shared between two cell-lines with at least 10 fold coverage in both cell lines. We choose FREQ, instead of direct counting of altered allele depth (AD), because that majority of altered allele fractions does not change with the expression level, and allele-specific expression may appear in cell lines with certain treatments but hopefully it will be a small proportion over a typically massive number of SNPs under consideration. To be specific, for any two cell lines \u2329 i, j \u232a, the variants to be tested are1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ V\\in \\left\\{{V}_k,\\kern0.5em where\\kern0.5em {d}_{i,k}\\ge \\kern0.5em 10\\kern0.5em \\&\\kern0.5em {d}_{j,k}\\ge 10\\kern0.5em \\&\\kern0.5em \\left({f}_{i,k}>10\\%\\left|{f}_{j,k}>10\\%\\right.\\right)\\right\\} $$\\end{document}V\u2208Vkwheredi,k\u226510&dj,k\u226510&fi,k>10%fj,k>10%where di,k and fi,k are the depth of coverage (DP) and altered allele frequency at genomic location k of ith cell line, respectively. Note that we require variant has to exist in at least one cell line with 10 fold coverage. If a gene does not express, all mutations within this gene will not be considered unless its partner cell-line expresses this gene at a sufficient level. Therefore, the expression difference is already embedded in Pearson correlation, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ {\\rho}_{ij}={\\sigma}_{ij}^2/{\\sigma}_i{\\sigma}_j $$\\end{document}\u03c1ij=\u03c3ij2/\u03c3i\u03c3j, where covariance and standard deviations will be evaluated over all variants in V. Similarly, correlations over gene expression levels between two cell lines are evaluated also by Pearson correlation coefficient, with requirement that genes with expression level > 0.1 (RPKM level) in at least one cell line. Hierarchical clustering was performed using MATLAB, using Pearson correlation of FREQ as the distance measure (over SNPs determined by Eq. 1), and with average linkage method.To determine the significance of a detected correlation coefficient for a given cell line, we generated all pair-wise correlations for 934 RNA samples, and its distribution follows normal distribution N(\u03bc, \u03c3). Similar distribution is also observed in pair-wise correlation from WES samples. To estimate distribution parameters, we removed correlation coefficients less than 0 (unlikely) and greater than 0.8 (most likely due to replicate and derivative cell lines in CCLE collection), therefore it forms a truncated normal density function within an interval (a, b), as follows,2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ f\\left(x;\\kern0.5em \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, b\\right)=\\frac{\\phi \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)/\\sigma }{\\left(\\Phi \\left(\\frac{b-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)-\\Phi \\left(\\frac{a-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)\\right)} $$\\end{document}fx\u03bc\u03c3\u03b1b=\u03d5x\u2212\u03bc\u03c3/\u03c3\u03a6b\u2212\u03bc\u03c3\u2212\u03a6a\u2212\u03bc\u03c3where we fixed cut-off a = 0, and b = 0.8. \u03d5 and \u03a6 are standard normal density and distribution functions, respectively. We chose b = 0.8 as a cut-off threshold since pairs with correlation > 0.8 are derived from same parental lines or with some other biological relevance (see subsection Cell line authentication using variant comparisons in Results Section). Maximum-likelihood estimate (using MATLAB mle() function) was employed in this study, and distribution parameters from distribution (scaled to match the histogram setting) for CCLE collection were estimated. For any given correlation coefficient \u03c1i for the test sample against ith sample in CCLE, its p = P(\u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1ij) = 1 \u2212 F(\u03c1ij; \u03bc, \u03c3, a, b), where F is the cumulative distribution function of Eq. 2, we consider they are possibly related if p < 0.001, and they are most likely derived from same cell origin if p < 10\u2212 4. Multiple samples are identified as matching cells, we can revise Eq. 1 to exclude all variants that shared from these matching cells, and then repeat the process.For gene expression level, the distribution of pair-wise correlation coefficient is more skewed towards 1.0; therefore, it is difficult to separate matching cells from mismatch cells (data not shown).Contamination estimation using linear mixture modelIn addition to authenticate cells, one may also want to know whether or not the processed cells are contaminated by other cells, possibly from CCLE or additional cell lines collected in the lab, along with RNA-seq data. Assuming the test sample is a mixture of cell lines x1 and x2, with unknown proportion q1 and q2, and we denoted the mixture cell as y, or,3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ y\\sim {q}_1{x}_1+{q}_2{x}_2+e $$\\end{document}y~q1x1+q2x2+ewhere y, x1, x2 are vectors of FREQs from selected variant sites of test mixture sample and CCLE cell lines. Eq. 3 can be re-formatted into matrix Y = qX, where q = [q1, q2, \u2026], if more than two cell mixture is hypothesized. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, our current implementation takes top 200 sites, each direction that has most difference in FREQ comparing two samples (total of 400 SNPs). To further simplify the procedure, we also use our CeL-ID to identify the dominant cell, say x1 first. Following the similar studies for de-convoluting cell type proportions [27, 28], we then test all 934 cell lines within CCLE collection, as x2, using robust linear model regression method (implemented in MATLAB fitlm() function) to estimate q1 and q2, provided q1 + q2 \u2264 1. Slightly different to typical cell-type deconvolution methods, after determining the first contaminator, we can iteratively add other candidates from the entire CCLE collection and perform linear regression, and terminate the process until q value becomes negative or regression fails (Fig. 1b).We designed a simulation procedure to evaluate the effectiveness of the robust linear model y, by the following method,4a\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ z={x}_1\\bullet N\\left({q}_1,{\\sigma}_{q_1}\\right)+{x}_2\\bullet N\\left({q}_2,{\\sigma}_{q_2}\\right) $$\\end{document}z=x1\u2219Nq1\u03c3q1+x2\u2219Nq2\u03c3q24b\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ y=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}0& N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)<0\\\\ {}N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)& 0\\le N\\left(z,{\\upsigma}_f\\right)\\le 100\\\\ {}100& N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)>100\\end{array}\\right. $$\\end{document}y=0Nz\u03c3f<0Nz\u03c3f0\u2264Nz\u03c3f\u2264100100Nz\u03c3f>100where, in Eq. 4a, N(\u03bc, \u03c3) is the Gaussian noise we added to q values (vectorized to the size of number of variants, each taking a Gaussian random number with mean of q1 and q2, normalized such that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ \\frac{1}{L}\\left(N\\left({q}_1,{\\sigma}_{q_1}\\right)+N\\left({q}_2,{\\sigma}_{q_2}\\right)\\right)=1 $$\\end{document}1LNq1\u03c3q1+Nq2\u03c3q2=1 .

Then, the liver is perfused with the perfusion solution containing collagenase by using a peristaltic pump at 3m l/m i n .()Figure 1. A schematic view of liver perfusion. After anesthesia, the abdomen is opened and the portal vein is identified by putting the gastrointestinal tract to the right side. A butterfly needle is inserted into the portal vein and fixed by a vascular clamp.

Live cells in the propidium iodide-negative (PI) fraction are further gated to get singlet cells on FSC-H (height)/FSC-W (width) plot. Next, non-hematopoietic (CD45TER119)/non-endothelial (CD31) cell are selected to isolate EpCAM cells.6.  In order to examine clonal proliferation capability and differentiation potential as LPCs, 5,000 to 8,000 of E p C A M^+ cells are plated in 35m m dish coated with laminin 111. Laminin 111 is diluted to 10 u/ml in PBS. One ml of the solution is added to a 35~m m dish and incubated at room temperature for 1~h~ . After 6-9 days of incubation, cells are washed with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA solution at 4~^\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Medium is changed at day 7 of culture. Non-specific antibody binding is blocked by Blockace and then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse CK19 and goat anti-mouse ALB for 4 h or overnight at 4^\u00b0C . Signals are visualized by Alexa488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor555  conjugated  anti-goat  IgG.  Nuclei  are  counter-stained  with Hoechst33258. Cells are treated with Hoechst and secondary antibodies at the same 4h 4^\u00b0C 35m m 1~ul time for 2 to at . For staining cells in a dish, 1 ml of PBS containing 4# bio-protocolof each antibody or Hoechst is used. After washing with PBS, images are captured on a fluorescence microscope by using 10x or 20\u00d7 objective lens. For a long-term storage, a plate is mounted with Prolong Gold. Colonies containing more than 50 cells are categorized into 2 groups; bipotential colonies, which consist of A L B^+ hepatocytes and C K19^+ cholangiocytes, and cholangiocyte ones, which consist of only G K19^+ cells. We define a cell forming bipotential colonies as LPC (Figure 3).()Figure 3. Typical cholangiocyte and bipotential colonies derived from a EpCAM+ cell.  A  colony  containing  only C K19^+ cholangiocytes  (green)  is  defined  as \u201ccholangiocyte colony\u201d (panel 1), whereas a colony containing both A L B^+ hepatocytes (red) and G K19^+ cholangiocytes (green) is as \u201cbipotential colony\u201d (panel 2). These colonies are derived from EpCAM+ cells isolated from 6W mice.7.  For analyzing effect of microRNA (or any target molecules) on hepatocyte or cholangiocyte differentiation, microRNA mimic and small interference RNA are introduced to cells forming colonies. First, clonal culture is continued for 1 month. Each large colony is surrounded by a cloning ring and then treated with 50ul of 0.05% trypsin at 37~^\u00b0C for 10 min. Cells are resuspended in fresh culture medium and then split into 2 wells of a 96-well plate. Two days after plating, cells were transfected with negative control or microRNA mimic by using RNAiMAX. Stealth RNA can be also used to knockdown a target gene. Cells are incubated in the presence of microRNA mimic for 2 days. Cells are suspended in lysis solution provided as RLT solution in RNeasy mini kit and then total RNA was extracted to prepare first strand DNA by using a RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instruction.# Notes1.  It is expected to acquire 2\u00d710^4 EpCAM+ cells from 6W liver.2.  For vigorous stirring, use a round-shaped stirring bar rather than a typical one. If red blood cells are abundant in pellet after hyaluronidase treatment, hemolysis in 16.5mM Tris-HCl/105 mM NH4Cl solution should be performed. If you need to increase efficiency of colony formation, add 20~uM Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor to culture medium.# Recipes1.

Prior to enrichment, all rats were housed in standard opaque plastic cages (45 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 22 cm high) in groups of three or four, from weaning until placement in enrichment at the stated ages. For each age group, on the first day of enrichment, 24 rats were re-housed in two enrichment cages (12 per cage) for either 14 or 28 days (1 cage per time-period; Enriched-14-day and Enriched-28-day). Twelve remaining rats were re-housed with new cage mates in standard cages (3 rats per cage) for the same time periods (2 cages per time-period; 6 rats total per time-period; Standard-14-day and Standard-28-day). All rats were rehoused with novel cage mates. Rats were maintained on a reversed light-dark cycle (lights off 08:00\u201320:00 h) and colony rooms were maintained at 22\u00b0C and 48% relative humidity. Food and water were available ad libitum. All procedures conformed to the NIH guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the University of Canterbury Animal Ethics Committee.EnrichmentA standardized enrichment protocol developed at the University of Canterbury was used (Harland et al., 2014; and see http://www.psyc.canterbury.ac.nz/Standardized%20Enrichment.shtml for details of, objects, arrangements and procedures). Enrichment cages were made of wire mesh with a sawdust covered metal floor and measured 85 cm x 60 cm x 30 cm high. Each day of enrichment consisted of a different combination of \u201cjunk\u201d objects such as ceramic figurines, metal chains, PVC pipes and junctions and other small items, along with an ever-present wooden block to discourage chewing of enrichment objects. Enrichment configurations differed over 40 different days (though a maximum of 28 was used here) and ensured no object was repeated within 5 days of itself. On every seventh day, PVC pipes and junctions were presented in a \u201ctubing only\u201d day, and on every eighth day, all objects (except the wooden blocks) were removed from the cage. Additionally, food and water positions were changed daily, and cages were rotated through one of four possible positions in the colony room every fourth day. Objects were changed at the start of the dark period (between 09:00 and10:00h), during which rats from one enrichment cage were held together in a large opaque plastic cage (62 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 22 cm high).Sacrifice and tissue extractionAfter either 14 or 28 full days of enrichment, or the same period of standard housing with new cage mates, rats were placed in standard cages at the same time enrichment objects were usually changed and held in a novel, dimly lit room separate to both the colony room and tissue dissection room. Rats from Enriched and Standard Housing were euthanised throughout a single day, with two Enriched rats sacrificed per one Standard Housed, and order of sacrifice randomized within these groups of three. Rats were deeply anesthetised with an overdose of Sodium Pentobarbitone (1mL, 300 mg/mL, ip). Once unresponsive to both tail pinch and plantar reflex (~5 min following injection), with no discernible heartbeat, rats were decapitated, and brains rapidly removed from the skull and placed in a brain matrix (Ted Pella). An initial coronal cut was made at the level of the optic tract. Additional coronal cuts were made 5 mm anterior and posterior to the initial cut, resulting in two \u201cslabs\u201d of fresh tissue (anterior extent approximately equivalent to Bregma +3.20 mm; posterior extent approximately equivalent to Bregma \u22126.30 mm; from the atlas of Paxinos and Watson, 1998). These tissue slabs were placed anterior-face-upwards on a glass petri dish, previously sterilized with 70% ethanol and rinsed with saline. Sterilization and rinsing was repeated between rats. Microdissection scissors were used to acquire tissue samples from seven regions of interest, starting in the posterior slab, in the order: occipital cortex, retrosplenial cortex (containing both dysgranular and granular B tissue), dorsal hippocampus (left and right hemispheres separately), mammillary bodies, hypothalamus and medial prefrontal cortex. Tissue samples were placed in pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes, weighed, and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen, within 15 min post-sacrifice, before long-term storage at \u221280\u00b0C.Tissue preparation and peptide measurementsCNP and NTproCNP were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), described in detail in (Yandle et al. (1993) CNP) and (Yandle et al. (1993) NTproCNP). Prior to assay, frozen tissue samples were transferred to dry ice chilled scintillation vials, then 10 mL of boiling distilled water containing 0.01% Triton X-100 was added and the vials were held at 98\u00b0C in a water bath for 5 min. Samples were acidified with 610 \u03bcL glacial acetic acid and homogenized prior to extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Following extraction, samples were dried under an air stream and frozen for later re-suspension in assay buffer for RIA. All tissues from an individual rat were processed in the same extraction, with tissues from housing groups counterbalanced across extractions.CNP assayCNP-22 is identical in all mammals studied thus far. CNP-22 and the amino terminal extended form CNP-53, both contain the 17-amino acid ring essential for bioactivity and show 100% cross reactivity in the assay used to measure CNP. Antiserum to CNP-22 (G-012-03, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) was diluted 1:2,000 with assay buffer. Labeled CNP was prepared by chloramine-T iodination of [Tyr0] CNP-22 (Peninsula Labs) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fifty microliters each of antiserum and CNP standard (0.7\u2013235 pmol/L) or sample extract (all in duplicate) were mixed and incubated for 22\u201324 h at 4\u00b0C, followed by addition of 50 \u03bcL labeled CNP containing 2,000 cpm for 22\u201324 h at 4\u00b0C. Bound and free labeled CNP were separated by a solid-phase secondary antibody method (Sac-cell, Rabbit-Anti Goat, IDS Ltd., England). CNP assays had a detection limit of 0.6 pmol/L and ED50 of 7.3 pmol/L; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5.9 and 7.4%, respectively, at 17 pmol/L.NTproCNP assayFor NTproCNP an in-house antiserum was used that recognizes the C-terminal epitope in the region of proCNP (38\u201350), which is identical in human, mouse, and rat (Prickett et al., 2012). Fifty microliters of sample extract or 0.5\u2013372 pmol/L proCNP(36\u201350) standards (again in duplicate) were incubated with 50 \u03bcL ovine antiserum (Sheep43) for 22\u201324 h, followed by addition of 50 \u03bcL tracer solution (proCNP(38-50)-[125I]Tyr37) containing 2,000 cpm for 22\u201324 h at 4\u00b0C. Bound and free labeled proCNP were separated by solid-phase second antibody method (Sac-cell, Donkey-Anti Sheep, IDS Ltd., England). NTproCNP assays had a detection limit of 0.4 pmol/L and ED50 9.9 pmol/L; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 6.8 and 7.5%, respectively, at 45 pmol/L.Statistical analysesCNP and NTproCNP concentrations were expressed as femtomoles per gram of wet tissue (fmol/g). NTproCNP:CNP ratio was calculated by dividing NTproCNP concentration by CNP concentration. In young rats, CNP assay failed in one sample from each of retrosplenial (Standard-14-day group) and occipital (Enriched-14-day group) cortices and data was excluded, reducing sample Ns in these regions. In aged rats, a portion of one sample from the hypothalamus (Enriched-28-day group) was lost, and data subsequently excluded. Two tissue samples had NTproCNP concentrations beyond the detection limit of the assay: one from mammillary bodies (Enriched-14-day group) and one from hypothalamus (Enriched-28-day group). Thus, sample Ns for aged rats are reduced for each of these regions (mammillary bodies and hypothalamus). In both age groups, final Ns for all other regions were: Enriched-14-day, N = 12; Enriched-28-day, N = 12; Standard-14-day, N = 6; Standard-28-day, N = 6. Initial analysis indicated there were no differences in any measure (CNP, NTproCNP or ratio) between left and right hemispheres of the dorsal hippocampus. Data was averaged across hemispheres for each rat and analyzed as a single value. Data acquisition and analysis for Young rats was conducted prior to acquisition of Aged rat data. As the Null Hypothesis was rejected in most cases for Young rats (see results), data from Aged rats were compared directly using cohen's d effect sizes. Analysis of data for Young rats was by Robust 2-way ANOVA with 20% trimmed means (after Mair and Wilcox, 2016; using WRS2 package for \u201cR\u201d). The statistical outcome measure of this test\u2014Q\u2014is interpreted in the same fashion as the traditional F statistic. Post-hoc testing of Young rats and Aged rat comparisons by effect size (cohen's d [\u00b1 95% CI]) calculations were all based on trimmed measures (using compute.es package for \u201cR\u201d). Figures provide boxplots displaying trimmed mean, standard error and 95% confidence intervals, overlaid with all data points (constructed using ggplot2 for \u201cR\u201d)."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Cell Wall Biomass Preparation and Fourier Transform Mid-infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy to Study Cell Wall Composition", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1494", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Biomass Preparation - Organic Solvent Wash"}, "1.1": {"title": "Pre-freeze and Freeze-dry Lignocellulosic Biomass"}, "1.1.1": "Pre-freeze and freeze-dry lignocellulosic biomass (time may vary depending on sample source, for whole Miscanthus spp. tillers, the samples were freeze-dried for an excess of 7 days to ensure complete dryness).", "1.2": {"title": "Grind Tissues"}, "1.2.1": "Grind tissues to a particle size in the range 0.18\u20130.85mm (suggested equipment: IKA A11 Handheld Analytical Mill;

Press the sample into optimal contact with the ATR crystal using the anvil of the Golden Gate ATR accessory.3.  Collect spectra in duplicate for each biomass sample Note: Each spectrum is collected by ATR in a mid-infrared range of 4,000-600 cm-1 and consists of the average over 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-1. Spectra were corrected for background absorbance by subtraction of the spectrum of the empty ATR crystal.4.  Recover the sample using a spatula or a razor blade (Video 1).# Video 1. Collection of FTIR spectra from cell wall biomass()5.  Clean the contact areas with a laboratory tissue wipe and ethanol between samples.6.  Repeat steps C1-5 for all samples.Convert each collected spectrum into an individual text file containing the spectral two dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x,y) (Figure 1) in two separate columns (we used the Bruker OPUS IR spectroscopy software). Subsequently, matrices containing the raw data may be created and the underlying relationships between the spectra may be investigated using numerical or statistical computing software (such as R or MATLAB). As an example, we used PCA to identify the features most distinctive of spectra collected from Miscanthus spp. leaf and stem cell wall biomass (Figure 2).()Figure 1.

In addition, organ-cultured corneoscleral tissue (n = 42) with appropriate research consent was provided by the Erlangen Cornea Bank after corneal endothelial transplantation. Informed consent to corneal tissue donation was obtained from the donors or their relatives. Experiments using human tissue samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical Faculty of the University of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (No. 4218-CH) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.Laser capture microdissection (LCM) and amplification of RNALCM and amplification of RNA was performed as previously described32. Briefly, corneal specimens destined for LCM were obtained from five donors (mean age, 69.6 \u00b1 10.4 years) within 15 hours after death. After labeling of the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants of donor globes, tissue sectors were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek Europe) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial cryosections of 12 \u03bcm thickness were obtained under RNAse-free conditions from the superior or inferior quadrants, placed onto UV-irradiated (3000 mJ/cm2) PEN (polyethylene naphtalate) Membrane Slides (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany), and stained with 0.01% cresyl violet. The PALM MicroBeam IV system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) was used to isolate clusters of basal limbal epithelial cells (LEPC) and basal epithelial cells from central cornea (BCEC). From each donor eye, 100 cryosections were dissected (50 from the superior and 50 from the inferior quadrants, respectively) yielding a total of 500 cryosections used for sample collection.RNA isolation from these specimens was achieved using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including an on-column DNase digestion step according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quality control was performed on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples with an RNA concentration of 650\u20132,000 pg/\u00b5l and a RIN (RNA integrity number) of \u22657.0 were used for further analysis. Following RNA-amplification using the MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, aRNA (amplified RNA) concentration was measured on a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and quality control was again performed using Agilent technology.Real time RT-PCRFirst-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 5 \u00b5g of aRNA from tissue samples or RNA from cultured cells and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) as previously described32. PCR reactions were run in triplicate in 1\u00d7 TaqMan Probe Mastermix (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) or 1\u00d7 SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, M\u00fcnchen, Germany), respectively, according to the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. Primer sequences (Eurofins, Anzing, Germany) are given in Table 2. For normalization of gene expression levels, ratios relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH were calculated by the comparative C T method (\u0394\u0394C T). Genes were considered as differentially expressed when their expression levels exceeded a two-fold difference in all specimens analyzed.Immunohisto- and immunocytochemistryCorneoscleral tissue samples obtained from 10 normal human donor eyes (mean age, 72.3 \u00b1 11.6 years) and 3D-cultures were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and frozen in isopentane-cooled liquid nitrogen. Cryosections of 4 \u03bcm thickness were cut from the superior or inferior quadrants, fixed in cold acetone for 10 minutes, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and incubated in primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Antibody binding was detected by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and nuclear counterstaining was performed with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). Immunolabelled cryosections and cultured LEPC were examined with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) or a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss Microscopy). In negative control experiments, the primary antibodies were replaced by PBS or equimolar concentrations of an irrelevant isotypic primary antibody.Cell cultureLEPC clusters were isolated from 42 corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 69.2 \u00b1 7.1 years) as previously described32. Briefly, organ-cultured corneoscleral tissue with appropriate research consent was provided by the Erlangen Cornea Bank after corneal endothelial transplantation. After rinsing in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution, the tissues were cut into 12 one-clock-hour sectors, from which limbal segments were obtained by incisions made at 1 mm before and beyond the anatomical limbus. Each limbal segment was enzymatically digested with 2 mg/mL collagenase A at 37 \u00b0C for 18 hours to generate epithelial-mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell clusters. Cell clusters were isolated from single cells by using reversible cell strainers with a pore size of 37 \u00b5m (Stem Cell Technologies, K\u00f6ln, Germany). Isolated cell clusters were further dissociated into single cells by digestion with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C for 10\u201315 min. Single cell suspensions were seeded into T75 flasks (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) in Keratinocyte serum free medium (KSFM) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies) and 1\u00d7 penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B mix (Pan Biotech) to enrich epithelial cell population (LEPC) and the flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. To enrich the associated mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSC), single cell suspensions were seeded into T75 flasks in Mesencult media (Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The media was changed every second day. Cultivated cells were used for real time PCR (n = 10), flow cytometry (n = 3), functional assays (adhesion: n = 4, integrin blocking: n = 4, migration: n = 3, proliferation: n = 13) and tissue engineering (n = 5).Flow cytometryLEPC cluster derived and enriched mesenchymal cells (LMSC, P1) were isolated from 3 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 66.5 \u00b1 4.6 years) and characterized by flow cytometry using anti-CD90, -CD73, -CD105, -CD44, -CD34, -CD45, -CD31 and isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). LEPC were characterized using anti-\u03b13 integrin-APC, anti-\u03b16 integrin-APC, anti-\u03b21 integrin-FITC and anti-\u03b24 integrin-eFluor660 antibodies (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany). Single cell suspensions (0.5\u20131 \u00d7 106 cells) were incubated with saturating concentrations of respective primary antibodies or conjugated antibodies in 100 \u00b5l PBS, 0.1% sodium azide and 2% fetal calf serum for 40 min. After three washes, the cells were centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Primary antibody reactions were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Cells were then washed and re-suspended in ice-cold PBS. After addition of 5 \u00b5l of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) to exclude dead cells, cytometry was performed on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) by using FACS Diva Software. A total of 10,000 events were acquired to determine the positivity of cell surface markers.Cell adhesion assayLEPC isolated from 4 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 74.2 \u00b1 5.8 years) were seeded onto 96 well-plates coated with recombinant LN-111, -211, -332, -411, -421, -511, -521 (1.0 \u00b5g/cm2; BioLamina, Sundbyberg, Sweden) and recombinant LN-511-E8 (0.5 \u00b5g/cm2; Nippi, Tokyo, Japan) as per manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. Coating solutions were prepared in 1x DPBS (Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline) with calcium and magnesium and incubated in culture wells either for two hours at 37 \u00b0C (fast coating) or overnight at 4 \u00b0C (slow coating) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells (P1-P2) were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 and left to adhere for 30 and 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. Standard tissue culture treated plates were used as control. After incubation, plates were washed with DPBS using a Static Cell Adhesion Wash Chamber (Glycotec, Maryland, USA) to remove non-adherent cells, and the adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. After three washes with water, stained cells were extracted with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and quantified by measuring optical density (OD) at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). All experiments (n = 4) were performed in quadruplicates. The fold change values were calculated as OD of the LN/OD of control.The effect of an interaction between cellular integrins and extracellular LNs on cell adhesion was evaluated by seeding LEPC (50,000 cells/cm2) in 96-well plates coated with recombinant LN-332, -511, -521, and LN-511-E8 in the presence or absence of integrin-neutralizing antibodies, i.e., anti-\u03b13 integrin (20 \u00b5g/ml) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-\u03b16 integrin (20 \u00b5g/ml) (Merck Millipore) and anti-\u03b21 integrin (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). 60 minutes after seeding, the numbers of adherent cells were determined as described above. LEPC used for integrin blocking assays were isolated from 4 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 67.7 \u00b1 6.1 years) and all experiments were performed in quadruplicates.Cell migration assayTo exactly measure the change in the cell-covered area over time, 2 well-culture inserts with a defined cell-free gap were used (ibidi GmbH, Planegg, Germany). Briefly, the wells were coated with LN isoforms as described above and seeded with 70 \u00b5l of a LEPC suspension containing 5 \u00d7 105 cells/ml. LEPC were isolated from 3 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 71.3 \u00b1 6.1 years). After formation of a cellular monolayer (24 hours), the silicone inserts were removed and the culture medium was supplemented with 2.5 \u00b5g/ml of soluble LNs. Images of each well were acquired immediately following insert removal (0 hours) and after 3 and 6 hours by using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus). Image analysis software Cell F (Olympus) was used to measure areas that were free of migrating cells. All experiments (n = 3) were performed in triplicates.Cell proliferation assaysLEPC used for cell proliferation assays were isolated from a total of 13 corneoscleral buttons after corneal endothelial transplantation (mean age, 70.0 \u00b1 8.0 years).The effect of LNs on LEPC proliferation was quantified using the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Colorimetric Assay Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells (P1-P2) were seeded into 96-well plates, coated with LN isoforms as described above, at a density of 5000 cells/well, cultured for 48 and 72 hours, and labeled with BrdU according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum), and fold change values were calculated as described above. Experiments (n = 5) were performed in quadruplicates.For immunocytochemical analysis of cell proliferation, LEPC (n = 3) were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well into 4 well- glass chamber slides (LabTek; Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany), cultured for 72 hours, and stained with antibodies against Ki-67 (Abcam; Cambridge, UK). Ki-67 positive cells were counted in the 4 wells using CellF image analysis software (Olympus). Ki-67 expression was also analyzed by real time PCR as described above (n = 5).In addition, cell numbers were counted after trypsinization of LEPC 7 days after seeding (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) in 6-well culture plates using CASY technology (Sch\u00e4rfe System GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) (n = 3).Tissue engineering of epithelial constructsScaffolds for tissue engineering and 3D-cell culture were prepared from fibrin as previously described38. Briefly, the gels were prepared by dissolving fibrinogen and thrombin stock solutions (Tisseel; Baxter Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) in 1.1% NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml fibrinogen and 3 IU/ml thrombin. Recombinant LN-511-E8 (10 \u00b5g/ml) was incorporated into the gels, which were placed into 24 well-culture inserts and allowed to polymerize at 37 \u00b0C. After washing with PBS, gels were additionally coated with LN-511-E8 (5 \u00b5g/ml) overnight. LN-511-E8 free gels served as controls. LEPC (P1) were isolated from 5 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 65.0 \u00b1 7.5 years) and seeded onto coated and uncoated control gels at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2 and cultivated in KSFM media under low calcium concentrations (0.09 mM Ca2+) for 5 to 6 days. Culture conditions were switched to DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 (Hyclone; GE Health Care Life Sciences, Freiburg, Germany) supplemented with Human Corneal Growth Supplement (Life Technologies), 10% FCS (GE Health Care Life Sciences), and high calcium concentrations (1.2 mM Ca2+) in order to promote cell differentiation. After another 6 to 8 days of cultivation, gels were fixed for immunohistochemistry as described above and for light and electron microscopy.For light and electron microscopy, gels were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin or epoxy resin, respectively, according to standard protocols. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate and examined with an electron microscope (EM 906E; Carl Zeiss Microscopy).Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad InStat statistical package for Windows (Version 5.04; Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean from individual experiments. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess statistical significance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Data availabilityAny additional data beyond those included in the main text that support the findings of this study are also available from the corresponding author upon request."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Determination of Mitochondrial DNA Upon Drug Treatment", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1377", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Cell Seeding"}, "1.1": "HepG2 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 2\u00d710^5 cells per well and allowed to attach overnight.", "1.2": "The volume of medium was 1.0ml in each well.", "2": {"title": "Incubation with Tested Compounds"}, "2.1": "After the overnight incubation, the media in each well was replaced with 1.0 ml of fresh media containing tested compounds and controls.", "2.2": "Incubated for 10 more days, with media replacement every 3 to 4 days.", "2.3": "The DMSO concentration was kept at 1.0% for all treatments, including control samples (no drug, DMSO only).", "3": {"title": "DNA Extraction"}, "3.1": "Following the incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS.", "3.2": "The total DNA was extracted from the cells using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.", "4": {"title": "Real-Time PCR"}, "4.1": "Real-time PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan universal mastermix in an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.", "4.2": {"title": "Quantification of mtDNA and Chromosomal DNA"}, "4.2.1": "Quantification of mtDNA was achieved by amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial specific cytochrome b gene.", "4.2.2": "Chromosomal DNA was quantified by the amplification of a fragment of the \u03b2-actin gene using a \u03b2-actin Assay-on-Demand kit.", "4.3": "Amplification reactions for the quantification of mitochondrial and chromosomal DNA were performed independently using approximately 25 ng of total DNA in a volume of 20 \u03bcl.", "5": {"title": "Data Analysis"}, "5.1": {"title": "Relative Quantification of mtDNA"}, "5.1.1": "The relative amount of mtDNA in treated samples was determined using a relative quantification method based upon the 2^(-\u0394CT) formula.", "5.1.2": "The amount of mtDNA (%) in compound-treated samples relative to the DMSO-treated controls was calculated.", "5.2": {"title": "Validation of the 2^(-\u0394CT) Method"}, "5.2.1": "The 2^(-\u0394CT) method was validated for cytochrome b and \u03b2-actin genes by determining the CT values for amplification reactions containing various amounts of total cellular DNA.", "5.2.2": "Minimal differences were observed in the \u0394CT values in samples containing 5 to 40 ng of total cellular DNA.", "5.3": "The effect of a positive control compound ddC (dideoxy cytidine) is shown in Table 3.", "6": {"title": "Recipes"}, "6.1": {"title": "Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium"}, "6.1.1": "GlutaMAX", "6.1.2": "10% fetal bovine serum", "6.1.3": "100 units/ml penicillin", "6.1.4": "100 units/ml streptomycin", "6.1.5": "1 mM sodium pyruvate"}, "text_flat": "Determination of Mitochondrial DNA Upon Drug Treatment\n\n1.

Following the incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS and the total DNA was extracted from the cells using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.4.  Real-time PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan universal mastermix in an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.5.  Quantification of mtDNA was achieved by amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial specific  cytochrome  b  gene  using  the  primers  and  probe  described  in  table  1. Chromosomal DNA was quantified by the amplification of a fragment of the  -actin gene using a  -actin Assay-on-Demand kit.6.  Amplification reactions for the quantification of mitochondrial and chromosomal DNA were performed independently using approximately 25 ng of total DNA in a volume of 20 \u03bcl.Table 1. Real-Time PCR primers and probe used in the quantification of the cytochrome b gene from HepG2 cells()# 7.  Data analysisa.  The relative amount of mtDNA in treated samples was determined using a relative quantification method based upon the 2^C_T formula (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).b.  The amount of mtDNA % mtDNA) in compound treated samples relative to the DMSO treated controls was calculated based upon the following formula:% m t D N A=100\u00d72^- CT C_T=C_T , treated \u2013 \u2206CT, control C_T , treated = (CT, cyt b \u2013 CT,  -actin) treated C_T , control = (CT, cyt b \u2013 CT,  -actin) controlCtau , cyt b and C T ,  -actin represent the cycle threshold values for the amplification of cytochrome b and  -actin, respectively, as determined by the computational analysis of amplification curves using the ABI Prism software. The final results are presented as the mean % mtDNA \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.c.  The 2^-CT method was validated for cytochrome b and  -actin genes by determining the C_T values for amplification reactions containing various amounts of total cellular DNA. Minimal differences were observed in the tau values in samples containing 5 to 40 ng of total cellular DNA; indicating that neither the amplification nor detection efficiencies of cytochrome b and  -actin were affected by the amount of DNA template within the dilution range relevant for the quantitative analysis performed in this study table 2.d.

Prior to experiments, worms were synchronized by hypochlorite isolation of eggs from gravid adults, followed by hatching of eggs in S Basal. Six thousand synchronized L1 larvae were transferred onto 10-cm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or NGM plates supplemented with 25 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin and 1 mM IPTG that were seeded with appropriate RNAi strains. After transfer, worms were grown at 20 \u00b0C for 50 h prior to use. Young adult worms were used for all assays unless otherwise noted.Bacterial strainsRNAi experiments in this study were done using RNAi-competent HT115 obtained from the Ahringer or Vidal RNAi library [82, 83]. All plasmids were sequence-verified prior to use.C. elegans chemical exposure assaysPrior to exposure to mitochondrial-damaging agents and/or antioxidants, synchronized young adult worms were washed from NGM plates seeded with OP50, and then resuspended in S Basal supplemented with one of the following: 50 \u03bcM antimycin A (Sigma), 50 \u03bcM rotenone (Sigma), 3 mM TTFA (Sigma), 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma), 20 \u03bcM CCCP (Sigma), 10% ethanol (Fisher), 1 mM phenanthroline (Sigma), 7 mM sodium selenite (Alfa Aesar), 1 mM H2O2 (Sigma), 60 \u03bcM tunicamycin (Thermo Fisher), 12.5 \u03bcM bortezomib (Thermo Fisher), 50 \u03bcM juglone (Sigma), 5 or 2.5 mM NAC (Acros Organics), 25 mM ascorbate (TCI), 5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical), and 10 \u03bcM mitoquinol (Cayman Chemical) in the presence of OP50. When specified, treatments were combined (e.g., rotenone/NAC, rotenone/NAC/ascorbate, etc.). Worms were imaged every 2 h for 20 h. Three biological replicates per experiment were performed, with ~ 400 worms per replicate.Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)Six thousand young adult worms were used for RNA purification and subsequent qRT-PCR (performed as previously described [84]). Prior to RNA extraction, worms were grown on RNAi bacteria from L1 stage to young adult stage. Primer sequences are available upon request. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates were used.Imaging and fluorescence quantificationFor visualization of the ALF86, CF1553, CL2166, GR2183, NVK90, NVK93, SJ4005, SJ4100, SLR115, WY703, and WY756 young adults exposed to mitochondrial-damaging agents in 96-well plates, Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) was used. All the imaging was performed with identical settings. GFP quantifications were performed by using Gen5 3.0 software and via flow vermimetry on COPAS FP (Union Biometrica). Approximately four hundred worms were used for Cytation 5 imaging and ~ 1000 worms were used for flow vermimetry per biological replicate, and three biological replicates were used for each experiment.ROS quantificationsSuperoxide was measured by using dihydroethidium (DHE) (Thermo Fisher) dye. Amplex Red assay was performed to measure hydrogen peroxide levels as described (Thermo Fisher). Worms were treated with mitochondrial-damaging agents for 10 h in 96-well plate before fluorescence measurement was taken. DHE was added at a final concentration of 3 \u03bcM and was let stained for 1 h in the dark. Worms were washed three times before reading to remove any remaining drugs or dye. Fluorescence intensities were recorded by using COPAS Biosort for DHE staining or Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) at 545/590 nm for Amplex Red. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates were used with ~ 400 worms per replicate.Cell cultureRWPE-1 cells were maintained in defined keratinocyte SF media (Sigma), supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher). 16HBE cells were maintained in minimum essential medium eagle (MEM) supplemented with 10% HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GE Healthcare) and 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher). All media were supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) at a final concentration of 1%. All cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Non-supplemented MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine was used for experiments. Cells were exposed to 20 \u03bcM CCCP or DMSO, alone or in combination with 0.5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical) or 2.5 \u03bcM MitoTEMPO (Cayman Chemical) in MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 16 h prior to RNA extraction and purification. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates of ~ 106 cells were used.Statistical analysisRStudio (version 3.6.3) was used to perform statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to calculate the significance of a treatment when there were three or more groups in the experimental setting. To follow, Dunnett\u2019s test (R package DescTools, version 0.99.34) was performed to calculate statistical significance or p values between each group of the statistically significant experimental results. Student\u2019s t test analysis was performed to calculate the p values when comparing two groups in an experimental setting. Both Dunnett\u2019s test and Student\u2019s t test results were indicated in graphs, NS not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.Figure 3c and Fig. S10E (Additional File 1) are generated with R package ggplot2 (version 3.3.0).

The mutagenesis-PCR was setup as followed: 1.25ul wtClcF plasmid (6 kbp) (20n g/u l) 1.25ul forward Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) ) with the respective mutation site 1.25ul reverse Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) with the respective mutation site5 \u00b5l dNTP-Mix (2.5 mM)5 \u00b5l Pfu-Ultra buffer1 \u00b5l Pfu-Ultra 2.5 U/\u00b5l35.25 \u00b5l WaterPCR-Program:()2.  At the end the reaction was supplemented with 1/10 volume of 10\u00d7 DpnI buffer and 10 U DpnI were added. The reaction was incubated at 37^\u00b0C for 1 h .3.  Afterwards 1.25ul of this mixture was transformed in ultracompetent E.coli DH5\u03b1.4.  Sequence integrity has to be proved by sequencing.5.  For expression purposes the plasmid with the codon sequence of ClcF or its mutants was transformed in E.coli BL21 (DE3)-CP-RIL.6.   For large scale protein production an overnight culture was setup with a colony from the transformation plate. The culture was incubated at 37~^\u00b0C and 250 rpm for 16~h in LB medium.7.  Afterwards 1 L LB medium was inoculated with the overnight culture in a ratio of 1/100 and further incubated at 37^\u00b0C and 250 rpm.8.  If the culture reached an optical density (OD600 nm) of 0.6 (app. 2-2.5 h) the protein production was induced by adding 1 M IPTG stock solution to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was further incubated for 4h at 30^\u00b0C .9.  After 4h induction the cells were harvested at 4,500\u00d7 g for 25 min at 4^\u00b0C .10. The resulting pellet was resuspended in app. ^20ml wash buffer and again pelleted at 4,500xg for 45 min at 4^\u00b0C .11. The resulting pellet was stored at -20~^\u00b0C until further usage.# B.  PurificationTo get protein of sufficient puritiy eq95~% (estimated from a SDS-gel) a three step strategy including a heat precipitation followed by a two step column chromatography was necessary.1.  The cell pellet from 1 liter culture volume was resuspended in ^25ml lysis buffer. A 2 M MgCl2 stock solution was added to a final concentration of 3m M and 0.5 U DNase were used to the digest DNA.2.  Cells were disrupted using a precooled French Press at 1,500 Psi. The cells were passed three times through the French Press to ensure complete lysis.3.  The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 50,000\u00d7 g for 1 h .4.  The supernatant was heated up to 65~^\u00b0C for 10 min in a water bath and afterwards cooled down on ice.5.  The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000\u00d7 g for 1~h~ .6.  The resulting supernatant (app. ^25~ml ) was applied on a Q -sepharose, preequilibrated with IEX-A buffer.7.  The protein was applied on the column and the ClcF containing flowthrough (app. 30~ml ) was collected.8.  Solid ammonium sulfate (AMS) was added to a final concentration of 1.6 M to the flowthrough of the previous step (app. 6 g).9.  The resulting solution was applied on a Phenyl-sepharose preequilibrated with HIC buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 0 M AMS over 20 column volumes by means of an Aekta chromatography system. ClcF containing fractions were identified by activity assay as described in the underlying paper (Roth et al., 2013).10. ClcF containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 250 times the protein volume of 25~m M Tris (p H7.5) at 4^\u00b0C . The dialysis buffer is changed once after 12h .11. Prior crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 10 m g/ m l (determined using the Bradford assay) with a VivaSpin concentrator with a MWCO of 30,000 k D a at 4,000 xg. . Aliquots of the protein were directly frozen at -80~^\u00b0C till further usage.# C.  Crystallization1.  Based on the recipes of the commercial or published screens (e.g. sparse matrix, grid screen), all necessary buffer solution were prepared as stock solutions at a concentration of 1 M at the relevant pH Jancarik and Kim, 1991; Brzozowski and Walton, 2001; Hampton Research (see Reference 5); Jena Bioscience (see Reference 6).2.  All salt solutions and precipitant solutions were prepared as stock solutions at the highest concentration possible and filtered if applicable. For ClcF, 1 M Bis-Tris solutions with a p H6.0 and 7.0 with a spacing of 0.2 pH units are produced (pH adjusted with NaOH/HCl). Furthermore a 2 M MgCl2-solution and a solution of 50 % (w/v) PEG 3350 are necessary. All solutions are prepared with double distilled water.3.  The conditions of the respective screens were generated by mixing the appropriate stock solutions, previously prepared, in an Eppendorf tube.4.  A screen was setup by a pipetting robot with a reservoir of 90ul in a Greiner Crystalquick96 well crystallization plate.5.  Drops were setup by pipetting 0.2~ul reservoir solution and 0.2~uI protein solution respectively together. No further mixing is required. The plates are stored afterwards at 19~^\u00b0C . The plates were then regularly examined (in the first week every day, afterwards weekly) for crystal formation. Crystals usually appears between one day and up to 3 months, but occasionally even longer periods might be necessary to obtain crystals. If a promising condition (crystals, microcrystals or crystalline precipitate) was identified a fine screen was setup in a hanging drop 24 well format usually by varying the pH around the initial condition in a range of pm~1.5~p H units and the precipitant concentration within an applicable range (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Typical scheme for a 2-dimensional 24 well grid screen, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time6.  The reservoir was prepared as described and drops were setup with a total drop volume of 2~ul by mixing 1~ul protein with 1~ul reservoir over a reservoir of 500~ul in a 24 well Linbro crystallization plate.7.  For orthorhombic crystals of ClcF the screen, with a constant concentration of 0.4~M M g C l_2 in all conditions, is shown in Figure 2.()Figure 2. Typical screen for orthorhombic ClcF crystals, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time. In all conditions is M g C l_2 in a final concentration of 0.4 M.8.  For a complex the protein was premixed with 10m M substrate (5-chloromuconolactone), dissolved in a concentration of 1 M in water at pH 7 (adjusted with NaHCO3). No elongated  incubation  period  is  required  prior  crystallization.  The  setup  of  the crystallization plate was carried out as described.()Figure 3. Promising crystalline material within protein precipitate as starting point for further fine screens (left) and typical single crystals of ClcF (right). Further pictures could be found on the Hampton Research website (see Reference 5).D.  Cryoprotection1.  A condition with good looking crystals was chosen and the reservoir solution was prepared with 2% elevated precipitant concentration supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol.2.  Subsequently small amounts, 0.1 to 0.2ul of the cryosolution was added to the drop and the drop solution slowly exchanged against the cryosolution.3.  In the case of the complex the cryosolution contained the precipitant in a final concentration of 25% plus the ligand in a concentration of 10m M . No additional ethylene glycol is required.4.

All other proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21-Gold (DE3) (Agilent). All primers used to construct plasmids for recombinant gene expression were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Their sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Cloning and expression and purification of pOA-mDHFRThe coding sequence for the first 178 amino acids of pOA were amplified by PCR from a parent pOA plasmid using primers for Gibson assembly that added a GSGS linker at the C-terminus. The entire mDHFR ORF was PCR amplified from a mDHFR plasmid with a C-terminal AviTag fused to the mDHFR fragment using Gibson Assembly (NEB). The backbone contained a T7 promoter. Cysteines were added at the desired positions using either site directed mutagenesis or insertion of synthetic DNA fragments (gBlocks, IDT). The p86 peptide sequence VSGWRLFKKIS34 was added to the end of the of the construct via PCR. The resulting plasmid (termed pOA-mDHFR) was transformed into E. coli strain MM52, which contains temperature sensitive SecA allele. A starter culture was grown at the permissive temperature (30 \u00b0C) until it reached OD600 of 0.5. The culture was then shifted to the restrictive temperature (37 \u00b0C), and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h. The cell pellet was harvested and washed with cold 1X PBS. Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) in 1X PBS pH 7.5. Inclusion bodies were washed with 1X PBS three times. Inclusion bodies were pelleted and frozen in liquid N2. The substrate protein was solubilized from inclusion bodies in 6 M urea before use.Expression and purification of SecYEGPlasmid pSOS334, encoding cysteine-free His-SecY, SecE and SecG, was a generous gift from Dr. Shu-ou Shan. Transformed BL21-Gold(DE3) cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.4\u20130.6 at 37 \u00b0C before expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 30,000g to remove cell debris, membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and solubilized in dodecyl-\u03b2-maltoside (DDM). SecYEG was isolated by ion exchange chromatography on a sulfo-propyl resin, followed by affinity purification with NiNTA resin. The purified protein was flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5, 150 mM KOAc, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.2% DDM.Expression and purification of SecAA plasmid encoding cysteine-free SecA with an N-terminal His tag was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG at 37 \u00b0C in cultures with an OD600 of 0.4 to 0.6. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KOAc, 10% glycerol with 1 tablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris, the protein was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography on a NiNTA resin in 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KOAC, 10% glycerol, and eluted with 300 mM imidazole. The eluted product was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer without imidazole. Protein aliquots were flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.Cloning and purification of NanoLuc 11 S and GST-darkThe codon optimized 11S sequence was obtained as a synthetic DNA fragment (IDT DNA) and cloned into a His-SUMO backbone (Addgene Plasmid #37507) for expression. The coding sequence for the p86 \u201cdark\u201d peptide (VSGWALFKKIS)33 was inserted into a plasmid encoding glutathione S transferase (GST) to generate a C-terminal fusion in the same backbone and termed \u201cGST-dark.\u201d For expression, plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.2% arabinose at 37 \u00b0C when the OD600 reached 0.4\u20130.6. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction at 37 \u00b0C and lysed by sonication in 1x PBS pH 7.5 with 1 tablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris, the protein was affinity purified from the supernatant using a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) in 1XPBS pH 7.5 and eluted with 300 mM imidazole. After cleavage of the His-SUMO tag, pure protein was obtained by reverse Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in 1x PBS pH 7.5. The protein was concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen in liquid N2.Encapsulation of 11S in SecYEG/SecA proteoliposomesUnilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion of E. coli polar lipids (Avanti) suspended in 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl through membranes with a 200-nm pore diameter. In order to swell the liposomes, 4.7 mM DDM was added to 5 mM lipids. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, proteins (5 \u00b5M SecYEG, 5 \u00b5M SecA, and 50 \u03bcM 11 S) were added to liposomes. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, followed by 4 incubations with BioBeads SM-2 (BioRad) to remove the detergent. The proteoliposomes were isolated by centrifugation at 250,000g, 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and run over a Sephacryl 200 column in order to remove unincorporated 11S from the proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes were recovered by ultracentrifugation before resuspension. They were flash frozen in liquid N2 for storage at \u201380 \u00b0C.Intramolecular disulfide bond formation in pOA-mDHFRIntramolecular disulfide bond formation in pOA-mDHFR was achieved by incubation with Cu2+/phenanthroline60. 1 mM Cu2+/phenanthroline was added to 10 \u00b5M protein and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h. Disulfide bond formation was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Oxidized protein was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until needed for translocation experiments.Protease-protection translocation assayTranslocation substrates were synthesized in vitro using the PURExpress system (NEB) in the presence of [35S]-methionine for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The translation reaction was transferred to ice and precipitated with three volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate in 20 mM HEPES. Precipitated protein was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 6 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Disulfide bond formation was achieved by incubation with 400 \u03bcM sodium tetrathionate for 30 min. Translocation reactions were performed in the presence of 0.2 \u03bcM SecYEG in proteoliposomes, 1.2 \u03bcM SecA, and in vitro synthesized substrate diluted 1:50, and in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 20 \u03bcg ml\u22121 BSA. After addition of 5 mM ATP, translocation up to the disulfide bond was allowed to proceed for 15 min. Subsequently, the disulfide bond in the substrate was reduced with 50 mM DTT, marking time zero. After translocation at 37 \u00b0C, sample were taken at defined time points and the reaction was quenched by addition of 18 mM EDTA and 1.5 M urea. Samples were then treated with 2 mg ml\u22121 proteinase K on ice for 30 min, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Real-time translocation assayExperiments conducted in the presence of MTX included 10 \u00b5M MTX in the buffer. Experiments conducted in the presence of both MTX and NADPH contained both 10 \u00b5M MTX and 10 mM NADPH in the buffer. Experiments for the apo conditions did not contain either ligand. For translocation measurements, 11S encapsulated proteoliposomes were incubated with buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 8, 100 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.1% Prionex) and 10 \u00b5M GST-dark for 10 min at room temperature. pOA-mDHFR containing a disulfide bond was added along with NanoGlo Live Cell Assay Buffer with NanoGlo substrate. After the addition of 5 mM ATP the reaction was taken to a plate reader (Promega GloMax Navigator) and the luminescence collected for approximately 30 min. During this time, additional GST-dark (0.5 \u00b5M) was added. After the luminescence signal plateaued, 1 mM DTT was added to reduce the disulfide bond and restart translocation, followed by luminescence data collection for 30 min. Background luminescence readings were collected in parallel for each reaction, using the same conditions and protocol described above except that water was added instead of ATP. Luminescence readings were collected continuously at a sampling rate of 0.2 Hz.Cloning and expression and purification of mDHFRTo generate an expression construct for mDHFR, we amplified the open reading frame from a mouse cDNA library using polymerase chain reaction and inserted it into a pBAD His6 Sumo TEV LIC cloning vector (Addgene Plasmid #37507) that had been engineered to encode an N-terminal Avi tag and C-terminal ybbR tag61. The mDHFR plasmid was transformed into BL21-Gold(DE3) (Agilent Technologies) host cells, and protein expression was induced with final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose (AMRESCO) at 37 \u00b0C when OD600 reached 0.4\u20130.6. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin) in 1X PBS pH 7.5 with two tablets of CompleteMini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris, the protein was affinity purified from the supernatant using a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The protein was dialyzed against 1X PBS overnight in the presence of 1:1000 (w/w) Ulp1 to remove the His6-SUMO tag. The cleaved protein was applied to the HisTrap column again to remove the His6-SUMO moiety and the His6-tagged Ulp1 enzyme. The purified protein in the flow through was then incubated with 1 \u00b5M BirA biotin ligase in 1X biotinylation buffer (25 \u03bcM d-biotin, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM Mg-acetate) at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h to ensure complete biotinylation of the Avi-tagged protein. Insoluble protein was removed via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C. The product was concentrated and loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column, and the flow through collected. After concentration, protein aliquots were flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.Derivitization of mDHFRIn order to immobilize mDHFR on polystyrene beads for optical tweezers experiments, we modified the biotinylated, ybbR-tagged protein with a CoA-modified double-stranded DNA (dsOligo-CoA) that also contained a \u201csticky end\u201d for ligation in an Sfp-mediated reaction61. After the reaction, the sample was centrifuged briefly (10 min, 16,000g, 4 \u00b0C) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) to remove Sfp and unreacted dsOligo-CoA. Successful derivatization was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, and the modified protein was flash frozen in small aliquots and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.Optical tweezers experimentsWe carried out optical tweezers experiments using a single trap optical tweezers instrument with two counter-propagating 845 nm diode lasers62. Single mDHFR molecules were tethered as described by Liu et al.61. All optical tweezers experiments were performed in 1X PBS, 1 mM EDTA and ligand depending on the experimental condition. One bead was held in the optical trap while the other was held on the micropipette. Force ramp data were collected with pulling velocity of 20 nm s\u22121 or 150 nm s\u22121 and a trap stiffness of ~0.1 pN nm\u22121. The force was increased until an unfolding event was observed, after which the force was decreased to 2 pN and the protein was allowed to refold for 15 s. Unfolding forces and extension changes were determined as described in detail in Liu et al.61. Contour length changes were calculated from extension changes using a worm-like chain model with a persistence length of 0.65 nm. Expected contour length changes were calculated using a contour length increment of 0.36 nm per amino acid for the unfolded polypeptide and a native-state end-to-end distance of 1.6 nm, determined from the mDHFR crystal structure coordinates pdb 1u70.Determination of kinetic rates from translocation dataThe time evolution of the luminescence signal in translocation experiments reflects the kinetics of sequential processes that result in substrate protein import, as well as interfering side-processes. The productive processes considered in our mathematical model are translocation, stalling at the disulfide loop, and unfolding. A competing process results in translocon incapacitation, i.e. the irreversible loss of translocation activity. Our model quantitatively describes translocation of pOA-mDHFR as a series of events: translocon engagement, stalling at the disulfide loop, translocation to the folded mDHFR roadblock, mDHFR unfolding and completion of translocation. We also take into account complicating processes that contribute to the total signal, namely the presence of substrate without a disulfide loop, incapacitation, and luciferase substrate depletion. Supplementary Fig. 2 provides a graphical overview of the model. A full description of the mathematical model is provided in Supplementary Methods.Determination of unfolding ratesThe protein unfolding rate in force spectroscopy measurements depends on the applied force. This force dependence is reflected in the distribution of rip forces from force ramp experiments. Dudko et al.48 developed a method to transform unfolding force distributions into force-dependent lifetimes. The force-dependent lifetimes can then be fit with an appropriate model to obtain an analytical expression for the unfolding rate as a function of force. This approach typically requires binning of the unfolding forces, resulting in loss of force resolution due to finite bin size. To avoid this information loss, we developed an analysis procedure that converts the force dependence of the unfolding rate into a probability distribution, which we then fit to our data using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach allowed us to use the experimentally observed loading rate for each molecule individually and calculate a global fit for datasets that cover a wide range of loading rates. A full description of the analysis method is provided in Supplementary Methods."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Virulence Studies of Clostridium difficile", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1002", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Weigh Hamsters"}, "1.1": "Weigh each hamster.", "2": {"title": "Gavage Clindamycin"}, "2.1": "Gavage 100ul clindamycin to each hamster (30mg clindamycin / kg body weight).", "2.2": "Note: Dilute the stock clindamycin to the appropriate concentration using DMEM.", "3": {"title": "Gavage C. difficile Spores"}, "3.1": "After 5 days, gavage 100 \u03bcl C. difficile spores.", "3.2": {"title": "Notes on Infectious Dose"}, "3.2.1": "Depending on the strain of C. difficile used, the infectious dose can vary.", "3.2.2": "In several strains, inoculation with approximately 100 spores will result in lethal disease.", "3.2.3": {"title": "Methods for Reproducible Infectious Doses"}, "3.2.3.1": "Suspending spores in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).", "3.2.3.2": "Using Teflon-coated tubes to reduce spore adherence.", "3.2.3.3": "Using water to achieve reproducible infectious doses.", "4": {"title": "Monitor Animals for Signs of Infection"}, "4.1": "Closely monitor animals for signs of infection including: wet tail, poor fur coat, lethargy, loss of 15% body weight.", "4.2": "Note: Signs of disease are commonly observed in 2 \u2013 4 days post infection.", "4.3": "Be sure to closely monitor the animals for the above symptoms.", "4.4": "Moribund animals can succumb to disease quickly.", "5": {"title": "Euthanize Moribund Animals"}, "5.1": "Humanly euthanize moribund animals, in accordance with your protocol that was approved by your Institutional Care and Animal Use Committee (IACUC).", "5.2": "Score the time required to reach a moribund state."}, "text_flat": "Virulence Studies of Clostridium difficile\n\n1.

Mice were fed with pellets containing vehicle or NR (400 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. The pellets were prepared by mixing powdered chow diet (2016S, Harlan Laboratories) with water or with NR dissolved in water. Pellets were dried under a laminar flow hood for 48 h. Mice were housed in groups of two to four animals per cage and randomized to 7\u20138 animals per experimental group according to their body weight.

The pCAX APPSwe/Ind plasmid was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #30145) and the human APPSwe/Ind gene was cloned into pLX304 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Plasmid #25890) by gateway cloning. The newly generated pLX304-APPSwe/Ind vector and lentiviral plasmid packaging mix (pCMV-dR8.2 with pCMV-VSV-G) were transfected into HEK293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo, #11668019). 48 hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was collected as a source of viral particles. Then C2C12 myoblasts were infected with lentivirus-containing medium with polybrene for 24 hours. Cells were selected in 5 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich, #15205). The C2C12 control and APPSwe-expressing myoblast cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), penicillin-streptomycin (1x, GIBCO) at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. After cells reach confluence, differentiation was initiated by replacing 10% FBS to 2% horse serum. The differentiation media were changed every two days.Human primary myoblasts lines were purchased from \u201cHospices Civils de Lyon.\u201d VCP IBM myoblasts were derived from a patient with heterozygote variation in the VCP gene: c.475C > T (p.Arg159Cys), previously associated with IBM in another study (Watts et al., 2004).

Briefly, for the generation of these lines, SJ4103 males were generated after exposure of L4 worms to 30\u00b0C for 5.30 h, and allowed to mate with L4 hermaphrodites from CL2122 or GMC101 mutant strains. The derived progeny was selected for homozygosis of SJ4103 by the presence of GFP in body wall muscle and for homozygosis of CL2122 and GMC101 by the intestinal GFP marker for a few generations. For RNAi experiments, worms were exposed to atfs-1 and dct-1 RNAi starting from egg stage to ensure robust knock down of the investigated genes.Method detailsBioinformatics analysisHuman or mouse gene expression data from muscle aging or various muscle diseases were obtained from GEO under the respective accession identifiers (Table S1). To identify the enriched gene sets across the different conditions, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) using the fgsea package (Sergushichev, 2016). Specifically, genes were ranked based on the fold change in muscle aging or muscle diseases against controls, and enriched gene sets were determined by enrichment analysis.For the analysis using GTEx datasets (GTEx Consortium, 2013), the skeletal muscle RNA-seq data and covariates were obtained from the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org) under version v7. The expression residuals after accounting for the known and hidden covariates were used for further analysis. To identify the enriched gene sets correlated with age of the sample donors, we ranked the genes based on their Pearson correlation coefficient against age and performed GSEA to determine the enriched gene sets.The modules associated to the amyloid beta formation (GO:0034205) module were determined using muscle datasets with over 80 samples through GeneBridge at https://www.systems-genetics.org/mmad (Li et al., 2019).Imaging and image processingConfocal images were acquired with Zeiss LSM 700 Upright confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) under non-saturating exposure conditions. The worms were immobilized with 7.5 mM solution of tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in M9 and mounted on 6% agarose pads on glass slides. For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 1 \u00d7 Formal-Fixx (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min. After 15 min permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were blocked in PBS supplemented with 5% FBS for 1 h and immuno-stained overnight at 4\u00b0C the anti-TOM20 antibody or stained using Proteostat. For aggregate detection with this dye, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at 21\u00b0C. Then cells were washed with PBS, followed by permeabilization for 30 min on ice using permeabilizing solution. Next, the cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated with Proteostat\u00ae dye for 30 min at 21\u00b0C. Cells were then washed with PBS, covered with glass coverslip, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Proteostat\u00ae Aggresome Detection kit (ENZ-51035-K100) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc and all components were prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. For cell immunostaining procedures, the secondary antibody was coupled to an Alexa 488 fluorochrome (Thermo Scientific) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306). Cell slides were mounted with DAKO mounting medium (DAKO, S3023) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Image processing was performed with the Fiji software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij; version 1.47b).Mitochondrial circularityTo quantify mitochondrial morphology, we used an ImageJ macro publicly available for download from the ImageJ Wiki site (https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/morphology/mitochondrial_morphology_macro_plug-in/start) and previously validated(Dagda et al., 2009). Briefly, the color channel of cells stained with TOM20 or worms expressing mito-GFP was extracted to grayscale, inverted to show mitochondria-specific fluorescence as black pixels, and thresholded to optimally resolve individual mitochondria. The macro traces mitochondrial outlines using \u201canalyze particles.\u201dGene expression analyses in C. elegans and miceTotal RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using TriPure RNA isolation reagent (Roche) according to the product manual. To analyze N2 worms at day 11 of adulthood a total of approximately 3,000 worms per condition, divided into three biological replicates, was recovered in M9 buffer from NGM plates and lysed in the TriPure RNA reagent. Each experiment was repeated twice. Total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Expression of selected genes was analyzed using the LightCycler480 system (Roche) and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master reagent (Roche). For worms two housekeeping genes were used to normalize the expression data, actin (act-1) and peroxisomal membrane protein 3 (pmp-3); for mice, the \u03b22-microglobulin (B2m) gene was used as housekeeping reference.Pharmacological treatment of C. elegansNicotinamide riboside triflate (NR) was custom synthesized by Novalix (http://www.novalix-pharma.com/) and dissolved in water, and used at a final concentration of 1 mM. Olaparib (AZD2281) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich dissolved in DMSO to experimental concentrations of 300 nM. Thioflavin T (ThT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference T3516-5G) dissolved in methanol and used at final concentrations of 5 and 50 uM (provided from L4 stage). Paraquat was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference 856177), dissolved in water and used at final concentration of 4mM. Compounds were added just before pouring the plates. To ensure a permanent exposure to the compound, plates were changed twice a week.Worm phenotypic assaysMobilityC. elegans movement analysis started from day 6 (N2) or day 1 (GMC101) of adulthood, using the Movement Tracker software (Mouchiroud et al., 2016). The experiments were repeated at least twice.Paralysis and death score45 to 60 worms per condition were manually scored for paralysis after poking, as described (McColl et al., 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2017). Worms that were unable to respond to any repeated stimulation were scored as dead. Results are representative of data obtained from at least two independent experiments.TMRM stainingWorms were incubated 24h on NGM agar plates containing TMRM (5uM) added to the medium before pouring the plates. Before imaging, worms were washed 3 times with M9 and incubated 30 minutes on regular NGM agar plates in the dark.Phalloidin stainingA population of 100 L4 worms was incubated for 24 h at 25\u00b0C. The worms were then washed in M9 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immediately after, worms were lyophilized using a centrifugal evaporator and permeabilized using acetone. 2 U of phalloidin (Thermo Scientific) was resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of a buffer containing: Na-phosphate pH 7.5 (final concentration 0.2 mM), MgCl2 (final concentration 1 mM), SDS (final concentration 0.004%) and dH2O to volume. The worms were incubated for 1 h in the dark and then washed twice in PBS.Real-time PCR for mitochondrial:nuclear DNA ratioRelative quantification of the mtDNA copy number in worms was performed by real-time PCR. Relative values for mtce-26 and act-3 were compared within each sample to generate a ratio representing the relative level of mitochondrial DNA per nuclear genome. The results obtained were confirmed with a second mitochondrial gene, nd-1. The average of at least two technical repeats was used for each biological data point. Each experiment was performed on at least ten independent biological samples.Cell culture and treatmentsDifferentiated C2C12 cells were treated with 1uM AZD or 3mM NR in differentiation medium for 24 hours after 4 days differentiation. Human primary cells were treated with AZD or NR after 14 days myotubes differentiation. Then myotubes were collected or fixated for analysis.For TMRM staining, cells were exposed to medium containing TMRM (100 nM final) and Hoechst (5ug/mL) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, then washed 3 times with PBS and imaged. Proteostat staining was performed using the manufacturer protocol.Mitochondrial oxygen consumptionMitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was evaluated using Seahorse analyzer (XF96, Agilent Technologies). OCR was measured using 1 \u03bcM of oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase, 2 \u03bcM of the protonophore Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and 1 \u03bcM rotenone/antimycin to block mitochondrial respiration and determine non\u2010mitochondrial OCR. ATP\u2010linked respiration was calculated by subtracting the uncoupled (after the addition of oligomycin) from the basal OCR. Maximum respiratory capacity was determined after FCCP addition, and spare capacity was determined by subtracting basal from the FCCP\u2010induced OCR. All Seahorse measurements were normalized by protein quantified by Bradford assay.Western and dot blot analysisC.elegans were lysed by sonication with TBS buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), and analyzed by western and dot blot. The concentration of extracted protein was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Membranes were blocked in 10% milk for 2h or overnight. Homogeneous loading was monitored by ponceau red. Antibody detection reactions for all immunoblot experiments were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Advansta) and imaged using the c300 imaging system (Azure Biosystems). Each immunoblot experiment was repeated at least twice using at least three biological replicates each containing approximately 1,000 worms.C2C12 cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting as for C.elegans. Each experiment was repeated at least twice using 3 biological replicates.For mouse tissues, frozen forelimbs samples were lysed by mechanical homogenization with RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for western blot analysis. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by dot blot as described for worms.HistologyTA muscles and brains were harvested from anaesthetized mice and immediately frozen in Tissue-TEK\u00ae OCT compound (PST). 8-\u03bcm cryosections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunostainings, heat activated antigen retrieval was performed in pH 6.0 citrate buffer for 10min at 95\u00b0C. After washing with PBS-0.1% tween 20 (PBST), the sections were blocked with 10% affinipure Fab goat anti mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) in PBS for 60min and PBST containing 2% BSA and 5% goat serum for 30min at room temperature. The primary anti-Oligomer A11 (Thermo Scientific, AHB0052) or anti-A\u03b2 4G8 (Biolegend, 800701) or laminin (Sigma, L9393) antibodies were then applied over night at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the slides were washed in PBST and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and labeling dyes. For immunofluorescence, secondary antibodies were coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa-568 fluorochromes (Life technology), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306). After washing in PBST, tissue sections were mounted with Dako mounting medium (Dako, S3023). Images were acquired using Leica DMI 4000 (Leica Microsystems) or Olympus Slide Scanner VS120 (Olympus) at the same exposure time. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence data was carried out by histogram analysis of the fluorescence intensity at each pixel across the images using ImageJ (Fiji; National Institutes of Health). Appropriate thresholding was employed to all the images of each single experiment to eliminate background signal in the images before histogram analysis. Fluorescence intensity and signal positive areas were calculated using the integrated \u201canalyse particles\u201d tool of the Fiji software.Quantification and statistical analysisNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Differences between two groups were assessed using two-tailed t tests. Differences between more than two groups were assessed by using two-way ANOVA. Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses. Variability in all plots and graphs is presented as the s.e.m. All p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. \u2217p < 0.05; \u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.01; \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.0001 unless stated otherwise. All mouse experiments were performed once. Animals that showed signs of severity, predefined by the animal authorizations were euthanized. These animals, together with those who died spontaneously during the experiments, were excluded from the analysis. These criteria were established before starting the experiments. For motility, fitness, and death scoring in C. elegans, sample size was estimated based on the known variability of the assay. All experiments were done non-blinded and repeated at least twice.", "Experimental model and subject details": "Experimental model and subject detailsAnimal experiments and ethical approvalMale 24 months old C57BL/6JRj mice were purchased from Janvier Labs. Mice were fed with pellets containing vehicle or NR (400 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. The pellets were prepared by mixing powdered chow diet (2016S, Harlan Laboratories) with water or with NR dissolved in water. Pellets were dried under a laminar flow hood for 48 h. Mice were housed in groups of two to four animals per cage and randomized to 7\u20138 animals per experimental group according to their body weight. All experiments were performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and authorized by the local animal experimentation committee (Commission cantonale pour l\u2019exp\u00e9rimentation animale) of the Canton de Vaud under license 2890.Cell cultureThe C2C12 cell line expressing the APP Swedish K670N/M671L double mutation (APPSwe) was generated in house. The pCAX APPSwe/Ind plasmid was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #30145) and the human APPSwe/Ind gene was cloned into pLX304 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Plasmid #25890) by gateway cloning. The newly generated pLX304-APPSwe/Ind vector and lentiviral plasmid packaging mix (pCMV-dR8.2 with pCMV-VSV-G) were transfected into HEK293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo, #11668019). 48 hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was collected as a source of viral particles. Then C2C12 myoblasts were infected with lentivirus-containing medium with polybrene for 24 hours. Cells were selected in 5 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich, #15205). The C2C12 control and APPSwe-expressing myoblast cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), penicillin-streptomycin (1x, GIBCO) at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. After cells reach confluence, differentiation was initiated by replacing 10% FBS to 2% horse serum. The differentiation media were changed every two days.Human primary myoblasts lines were purchased from \u201cHospices Civils de Lyon.\u201d VCP IBM myoblasts were derived from a patient with heterozygote variation in the VCP gene: c.475C > T (p.Arg159Cys), previously associated with IBM in another study (Watts et al., 2004). The IBM diagnosis in the patients was validated by the \u201cHospices Civils de Lyon\u201d through scores for inflammation, p62-positive aggregates in fibers and vacuoles, mitochondrial dysfunction, and indicative clinical signs. Cells were grown in DMEM/F-10, supplemented with 12% FBS (GIBCO) and penicillin\u2013streptomycin (1 \u00d7 , GIBCO). Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and tested for mycoplasma using Mycoprobe (CUL001B, R&D systems).C. elegans strains and RNAi experimentsC. elegans strains were cultured at 20\u00b0C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with E. coli strain OP50 unless stated otherwise. Strains used in this study were the wild-type Bristol N2, SJ4103 (myo-3::GFP(mit)), GMC101 (unc-54p::A-beta-1-42::unc-54 3\u2032-UTR + mtl-2p::GFP) (McColl et al., 2012), CL2122 ((pPD30.38) unc-54(vector) + (pCL26) mtl-2::GFP) and RW1596 (myo-3p::GFP).

Heterozygous individuals of F1 progeny were grown at 25\u00b0C. Progeny resulting from Canton-S crossed with flies harbouring the reporter system was used as control in order to evaluate the iRNA effects in the same genetic background of the reporter system.Commercial cigarette smoke administrationBy means of a homemade device (Gomez et al., 2019), two doses of 10 cc of commercial cigarette smoke (composition in mg for each cigarette: 10 tar, 0.7 nicotine and 10 carbon monoxide) were administered daily for 7 days starting on day 3 after hatching. Flies were exposed to the tobacco smoke for 5 min each time at an interval of 6 h. Afterwards, the flies were dissected and hearts were used for assessing intracellular calcium handling.Acute administration assays: pulse of nicotineIn order to assess if one of the main components of commercial cigarettes, nicotine, was responsible for the effects associated with the administration of tobacco smoke, nicotine was added to the hemolymph (final concentration of 1.69 mM in the preparation).Semi-intact preparation was mounted in a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss 410) and the fluorescent signal of the calcium sensitive reporter was recorded for 30 s. Next, nicotine was added to the preparation and calcium signal was immediately recorded for the following 30 s.Heart dissectionHearts were dissected and prepared as described by Santalla et al. (2014). Briefly, adult flies were anaesthetized with CO2, and thorax and legs were removed from the fly. Flies were bathed in oxygenated hemolymph buffer (in mM, 108 NaCl, 5 KCl, 8 MgCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 4 NaHCO3, 5 HEPES, pH 7.1, 10 sucrose, 5 trehalose and 2 CaCl2) (Vogler and Ocorr, 2009; Santalla et al., 2014; Balcazar et al., 2018) at room temperature. After dissection, semi-intact preparations of adult hearts were maintained for 40\u201345 min. In cases in which this procedure might take longer time for analysis, other hemolymph preparations have been shown to be useful to preserve the physiological states of the organ (de Castro et al., 2014, 2019).Functional analysisBeating hearts from semi-intact preparations were observed under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss 410), and changes in GCaMP3 fluorescence in the first cardiac chamber (conical chamber) were recorded. Transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that precedes cardiac contraction was detected as a fluorescent signal. Measurements included: Ca2+ transient amplitude (\u0394F/F0, expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence, AU), maximal rates of increasing and decreasing fluorescence (+d\u0394F/F0/dt) (in AU/second), (\u2212d\u0394F/F0/dt) (in AU/second), time to peak of Ca+2 transient (TTP) (seconds) and half-relaxation time t1/2 (seconds). Number of fluorescent events per minute were counted to obtain heart rate, and the diastolic periods (stable fluorescent signal between calcium transients) were measured. Arrhythmicity index (AI) was calculated as the standard deviation of periods (time between maximal fluorescence of consecutive beats) normalised by their average (Balcazar et al., 2018).Statistical analysisAll results from functional analyses of calcium handling were expressed as mean\u00b1s.e.m.

All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma.Cloning of the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/\u0394N cDNAcDNAs (Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/\u0394N were synthesized from the GenScript company (the N gene is replaced with gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP)). PCR was conducted to amplify fragments A, B, C, D and E using high fidelity PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara). T7 promoter was introduced upstream of 5\u2019 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genome in fragment A. To guarantee a seamless assembly of the full-length cDNA, type IIS restriction endonuclease sites (BsaI or BsmBI) were introduced at both ends of PCR fragments. The primers used for the PCR assay were listed in S1 Table.Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV-2 GFP/\u0394N cDNAPCR fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) to get specific sticky end. Digested fragments are purified by E.Z.N.A gel extraction kit (Omega). Fragment A, B are ligated first by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in 40\u03bcl system. At the same time, fragments C, D, E are also ligated in another tube at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours. Then, fragment A, B and C, D, E are combined together added with 2\u03bcl T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2\u03bcl T4 DNA ligase to 100\u03bcl at 4\u00b0C for another 24 hours. At the end of ligation, we took 5\u03bcl product to run an agarose gel to check the efficiency of ligation. Full-length assembly cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, isopropanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10\u03bcL nuclease-free water.

Twenty micrograms of viral RNA and 20\u03bcg N mRNA were mixed and added to a 4-mm cuvette containing 0.4 mL of Caco-2-N cells (8\u00d7106) in Opti-MEM. Single electrical pulse was given with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with setting of 270V at 950\u03bcF. GFP signal can be observed 17 hours post electroporation. Three days post electroporation, P0 virus was collected and Caco-2-N cells were infected with P0 virus to amplify virus.Lentivirus packagingVesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced by transient cotransfection of the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog number 12260; Addgene) and the transfer vector pLVX by VigoFect DNA transfection reagent (Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection. Supernatants were collected at 36, 60 and 84 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80\u00b0C refrigerator.RNA isolation and RT-qPCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo, 15596018). To analyze the RNA level of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. In brief, 1\u03bcg total RNA was reverse transcribed using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-101) to produce cDNA with random primers. Reactions of qPCR were carried out using the 2\u00d7RealStar Green Power Mixture (Genstar, A311) according to the instruction. The qPCR primers for viral RNA were as follows: THU-2190 (5\u2019- CGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCC-3\u2019) and THU-2191 (5\u2019- TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3\u2019). The sequences of the qPCR primers for GAPDH was described previously[44]. Relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. All data were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.RNA-seq and data analysisTotal RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The rRNAs were removed by using Ribo-Zero Gold module of Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA library prep kit (RS-122-2201) and then cDNA libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA-seq was performed by using the Illumina Novaseq platform. The reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947) was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore /MN908947. After removing low-quality reads, remaining Illumina sequence reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) and SARS2 genome by using HISAT2.1.0 with parameters:\u2014rna-strandness RF\u2013dta. RNA-seq coverage was visualized by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). To quantify the expression levels of SARS2 genes, RPKM of each virus genes and GFP gene were calculated. Heatmaps were drawn by using R package \u201cpheatmap\u201d (https://www.r-project.org). To quantify the junction-reads from subgenomic RNAs, the STAR2.7.5c was used for reads mapping. The junction-reads was defined and collected as described[45]. A Sankey diagram was drawn by using R packages named \u201cnetworkD3\u201d and \u201cdplyr\u201d.IFN-\u03b2, neutralizing antibody and drug treatmentTo assess the antiviral efficacies of the materials, 1\u00d7104 Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 GFP\u0394N virus at MOI of 0.05. For neutralizing antibody treatment, virus was incubated with neutralizing antibody for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C before infection. For IFN-\u03b2 (Sino Bioligical, 10704-HNAS-5) test, cells were pre-treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 8 hours before infection. For remdesivir (MedChemExpress, HY-104077), lopinavir (biochempartner, BCP01395) or ritonavir (biochempartner, BCP03777) treatment, drugs were added simultaneously upon infection. Two days after infection, flow cytometry was performed to analyze GFP positive rate. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50; compound concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% reduction of GFP positive cells) were determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Cell viability assayCaco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plate (1\u00d7103 cells/well). After 12 hours, cells were treated with drugs with different concentrations. Cell viability was measured two days post treatment with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7570) following standard protocol. In brief, cells in 100 \u03bcl culture medium were added with 100 \u03bcl CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 15 minutes, luminescence was recorded with GloMax (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Flow cytometry analysisCells were detached in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA and then washed once with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRFortessa SORP (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.Western blottingSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting was conducted as follows: After trypsinization and cell pelleting at 1500 r/m for 10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 4\u201312% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked at room temperature for 0.5 h using 5% nonfat milk in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-N (05\u20130154, AbMax), S (40589-T62, Sino Biological), \u03b2-Tubulin (CW0098, CWBIO), Flag (F7425, Sigma), ACE2 (10108-T24, Sino Biological) in 5% nonfat milk in 1\u00d7PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were then washed in 1\u00d7PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After 1h exposure to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent washes were performed as described for the primary antibodies. Membranes were visualized using the Luminescent image analyzer (GE).Antiviral screeningTwelve hours prior to infection for the antiviral screening 5 \u00d7 104 Caco-2-Nint cells were seeded in 96 well plates. The next day, a single dilution of each compound of the Topscience Natural Product Library at 5 \u03bcM final concentration was added to the cells (50 \u03bcL/well). DMSO or remdesivir (3.5\u03bcM) were included in each plate as the internal control. After 2 hours, 50 \u03bcL of virus was added to the wells at MOI 0.05. Two days after infection, cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis to determine the GFP expression.Evaluation of antiviral activity using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virusA549 cells stably expressing human ACE2 were seeded in a 96-well plate (4\u00d7104 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with drugs (Lycorine chloride (TargetMol, T2774), Tubeimoside I (TargetMol, T2715), Nigericin sodium (TargetMol, T3092), Monensin sodium (MedChemExpress, HY-N0150), Salinomycin (MedChemExpress, HY-15597)) of different concentration for 2 hours prior to infection. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS culture medium for 24 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1 \u03bcg/ml) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo #A32732, 2 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by staining with 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an Operetta High Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). For high content imaging, two biological replicates for each concentration of drug were scanned and five representative fields were selected for each well of 96-well plates. Image analysis was performed using the PerkinElmer Harmony high-content analysis software 4.9. Cells were automatically identified by DAPI (nuclei). Mean fluorescent intensity of channel Alexa 555 (viral nucleocapsid) of each cell were subsequently calculated, respectively. For the 0% inhibition control, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in N protein expression. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the dose-response (variable slope) equation (four parameter logistic equation).SARS-CoV-2 infection and biosafetyThe SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-SH01 (GenBank accession no. MT121215) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and propagated in Vero E6 cells for use. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of Tsinghua University has approved the SARS-CoV-2 trVLP cell culture system use in BSL-2 if the Caco-2-Nint cells were used for infection by SARS-CoV-2 trVLP within 8 passages. All other experiments in this study involving authentic virus or SARS-CoV-2 trVLP infections were performed in the biosafety level 3 facility of Fudan University following all regulations.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used to test for statistical significance of the differences between the different group parameters.

Prepare the conversion cassette SU32 by PCR using a plasmid pSU32 as template. To obtain this template, visit the following webpage. http://www.iac.saga-u.ac.jp/lifescience/su32/index.htmb.  For PCR amplification, the primer pair was pSU30-14 and pSU30-23 (40 cycles of 98~^\u00b0C for 10 sec, 55~^\u00b0C for 15 sec, and 68~^\u00b0C for 75 sec using Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase) (Goto and Nagano, 2013). When we conduct the PCR reaction, we use Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase, but you can use the other proofreading DNA polymerases. Note: Although we purified the amplified conversion cassette in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential (purification is required for DNA quantification).c.  Confirm the amplification by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicon size is about 2.7 kb (2,651 bp) (Figure 3).()Conversion cassette SU32# Figure 3. Conversion cassette SU322.  Preparation of the linearized E. coli plasmid vector a.  Digest the E. coli plasmid vector within the crossover region by using restriction enzyme.Notes:i.   The required restriction ends can be located anywhere within the crossover regions of the vector. You can use both blunt-end restriction enzyme and sticky-end restriction enzyme, because restriction ends are not positions where joining reactions occur.ii. This E. coli plasmid vector must contain the Ampr gene.iii.  PCR amplification of the E. coli plasmid vector is another way to prepare the linearized E. coli plasmid vector.iv.  Although we purified the digested plasmid in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the digestion by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.c.  Next Figure shows one of the examples of the restriction digestion (Figure 4 also shows how to join the DNA fragments).()pUC19 digested by EcoRI-HF and Xbal# Figure 4. pUC19 digested by EcoR I-HF and Xba I3.  Preparation of the DNA fragment to be cloned.a.  Amplify a DNA fragment of interest by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerase suchas Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase.# Notes:i. PCR primers should be designed to carry the sequences with more than 20 bp of homology to the crossover region. We often use the sequences with 30-40 bp of homology to the crossover region. For the highest efficiency, we recommend you to use PCR primers purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the PAGE purification is not essential.ii.  Although we purified the DNA fragment of interest in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis.# 4.  Transformation of DNA fragments into yeast.# Notes:i.   In our laboratory, we perform the transformation procedure at half or quarter scale of this method. ii.   The molar ratio of the 3 DNA fragments was 1:1:1. However, this ratio is not important (Goto and Nagano, 2013). (Ten-fold variation of the ratio probably does not affect the efficiency.) Required amount of the conversion cassette SU32 is < 50n g. . b.  Select the transformants by incubating yeast cells on synthetic complete plates lacking tryptophan at 30~^\u00b0C for 2 or 3 days.# 5.  Purification of plasmid from yeast.Note: To purify plasmid DNAs from yeast, we use a Mini-M Plasmid DNA ExtractionSystem, but you can use the other Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit for E. coli.a.  Scrape all colonies from the plates with plating beads, and collect yeast cells by the centrifuge. Using the microfuge, centrifuge cells at 14,000\u00d7 g for 5 sec (we often use the picofuge at a maximum speed for 30 sec). Remove the supernatant.b.  Add the suspension buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 200~ul of MX1 buffer), and suspend the yeast cells by vortexing.c.  Scoop equal amounts of acid-washed glass beads (350-500~um) to the suspended solution using 1.5~m~ tube, add glass beads into tube containing the suspended solution, and then disrupt yeast cells by shaking 3 times for 20 sec at speed 5.5 using the FastPrep FP100A. Alternatively, vortex 5 times for 1 min at maximum speed. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()d.  Add denaturation buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 250~ul of MX2 buffer), and gently mix.e.  Punch a hole in the bottom of the tube by needle (18 gauge). Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()()f.   Attach another tube to the bottom of the tube, and centrifuge them to recover the denatured solution in the bottom tube. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()g.  For subsequent procedures, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. However, use elution solution preheated to 70~^\u00b0C . Because DNA concentration of the eluted solution is low, you cannot determine the concentration of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometer. However, the DNA concentration of the eluted solution is sufficient for next procedures. Therefore, the condensation of the eluted solution is not required.6.  Pretreatment of the eluted solution (Optional)a.  For the highest efficiency, digest 5~ul of the recovered plasmids (the eluted solution) with small amounts (in.g. 0.2 lHl) ) of an appropriate restriction enzyme by directly adding the enzyme to the eluted DNA solution. Note: Because the principle of this method is complicated, read our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013) carefully. Do not add an enzyme reaction buffer, because the salt may affect the next electroporation step.b.  Incubate the tube at an appropriate temperature for more than 1 h.7.

Both lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium, high glucose (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) (D10). Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for the duration of experimentation.A number of VACVs were used within this study. Non-recombinant, VACV Western Reserve strain (VACV WR), was a kind gift of B. Moss, NIH. A recombinant virus possessing lacZ and mCherry gene insertions within the thymidine kinase (TK) gene was denoted VACV-mCh. This virus was generated by homologous recombination using the pSC11-mCh plasmid described below, and screened for fluorescence prior to plaque purification. VACV F5-GFP and VACV-A3-GFP have been described previously, and express eGFP fusions at the carboxy-terminus of F5 and amino-terminus of A3, respectively37,38. VACV B5-GFP has the same eGFP construct as A3, but fused to the 3\u2032 end of gene B5R in its native location. This virus has not been described elsewhere but was made by conventional homologous recombination with a transfer plasmid by published methods61. The identity of VACV B5-GFP was verified by PCR fragment length and sequencing of the region of the genome that was manipulated. VACV infections were carried out as follows. Briefly, cells were exposed to virus diluted in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (D0) for 1 h before rescuing with 2% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM (v/v) L-glutamine-containing DMEM (D2). Virus titres were quantified by standard plaque assay on BS-C-1 cells, whereby confluent cell monolayers were infected with 10-fold serially diluted virus in D0 for 1 h, before media removal and overlay with 0.4% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose in D2. At 48\u201372 h post-infection (hpi), plaques were either visualised microscopically or by crystal violet staining using a 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet and 15% (v/v) ethanol fixing solution.Plasmids and single-guide RNAs (gRNAs)Four homologous recombination plasmids were used for the majority of the work in this study. Briefly, pSC11-mCh contained an mCherry gene (NCBI #MK160997.1) under the control of a p7.5 early VACV promoter, which has been inserted into a previously characterised pSC11 VACV recombination vector62,63. This backbone possesses a lacZ gene under the control of a p11 late VACV promoter and regions of homology to the TK gene of VACV64. The pSC11-Venus plasmid was created from the same backbone, but instead possesses a venus gene (NCBI #DQ092360.1) under the p7.5 promoter. pBII-\u0394R was used previously to generate a recombinant VACV with a 23 kb deletion in the right arm of the genome39. In this case, recombination was utilised to replace VACV WR genes from Spi2 to C11R with mCherry. Alternatively, the pSpi2 plasmid was synthesised by Integrated DNA Technologies, and contains a modified Spi2 gene insertion in a pUCIDT-Amp commercial vector backbone. The gene insert has 500 bp homology arms which flank a region of interest in Spi2. This 20 bp sequence contains a premature stop codon at position 147, introduced EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites and bases that have been altered for evasion of recognition by the Spi2-gRNA (5\u2032-AAAGGAGGAGAACATGGATA-3\u2032).Other gRNA sequences used in this study include those specific to TK (TK-gRNA: 5\u2032-TCACAGAATTCAACAATGTC-3\u2032), mCherry (mCh-gRNA: 5\u2032-GGATAACATGGCCATCATCA-3\u2032), eGFP (eGFP-gRNA: 5\u2032-GCTGAAGCACTGCACGCCGT-3\u2032)33 and A23R (A23R-gRNA: 5\u2032-GAAAGAACGCATTTCCTCAG-3\u2032)33. All gRNA sequences were ordered as single RNA molecules, where the gene-specific sequence prefaced a common tracrRNA sequence (5\u2032-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCCGTTATCAACTTGAAAAAGTGGCACCGAGTCGGTGC-3\u2032). A list of each virus used in this study can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1.CRISPR/Cas9 transfectionsThe standard method for the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in this study followed an infection/transfection approach. Briefly, a 1 h VACV infection (MOI 0.05) preceded transfection of sub-confluent 293A cells with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and in some cases templates for homologous recombination. These pre-formed RNP complexes contained Cas9 nuclease (20 \u03bcM) lacking a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) (New England Biolabs) and 2 \u03bcg of appropriate gRNAs. Complex formation was allowed to progress for 30 min prior to transfection. All transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in D0 media for 4 h, before replacement with fresh D2 media and incubation for 48 h. At this point, wells were imaged to assess fluorescence and cells and supernatant were retained for further analysis. Virus titres and CRISPR-editing capacity were monitored using flow cytometry. Briefly, scraped cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and resuspended in 2% (v/v) FBS-containing PBS. Venus and mCherry expression, as well as cell counts were captured with an ACCURI (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Cytometry data was compiled using FlowJo software (v10.6.2). In addition, plaque assays (described above) were used to titrate viruses on BS-C-1 cells and count edited viral plaques. Note, for experiments involving recombination, plasmids were first linearised by overnight digestion and then co-transfected with the Cas9/gRNA complexes.To investigate the temporal effects of transfection and infection on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, this protocol was reversed. That is, cells were first transfected for 4 h before reagents were removed and the appropriate virus was added to cells. Again, transfection/infections were allowed to progress for 48 h.Cas9 selectionFor Cas9 selection experiments, sub-confluent 293A cells were first infected with VACV (MOI 0.05) for 1 h, then transfected with linearised plasmid alone for 24 h. Cells and supernatant were obtained as before and used to infect fresh 293A cells that had been pre-transfected with Cas9/gRNA complexes. At 48 h, this process was repeated to give a total of two rounds of CRISPR/Cas9 selection and analysed by fluorescence or PCR screening techniques. Note that at each point, virus titres were determined by plaque assay.Viral genome quantitation by qPCRTo assess genome copy numbers and relative proportions of whole and cleaved genomes, two qPCR analyses were performed using TaqMan probe chemistries. To enhance the sensitivity of these assays, the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection/infection protocol above was followed with minor changes. First, 293A cells were transfected for 4 h, as before, with pre-formed Cas9/gRNA complexes. Subsequently, infections were carried out with a higher titre of VACV-mCh virus (MOI 1) for a shorter period of time (10 min). At this point, cells were washed in PBS to remove unattached virions and re-supplied with fresh D2 media. Infections were then allowed to progress for the specified times prior to DNA extraction.For DNA isolation, cells and supernatant were collected and snap-frozen in a dry ice and ethanol bath. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) protocol was followed to retrieve DNA from each sample, the concentration of which was determined by Nanodrop (ThermoFisher) spectrophotometer analysis. For DNA standards, DNA was isolated from a sucrose cushion purified stock of VACV WR. A Qubit dsDNA BR (Broad-Range) Assay Kit and Qubit Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher) were utilised to determine the concentration of the DNA standard.For qPCR analysis, custom TaqMan Gene Expression assays were designed by ThermoFisher to analyse A23R and mCherry gene levels. Proprietary probes for these genes were complexed to FAM and VIC dyes, respectively, to facilitate multiplexing. With these pre-designed assays, 1.25 \u03bcg DNA was added to each well alongside 5 \u03bcL of TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (ThermoFisher) and 0.5 \u03bcL of the probe and primer pre-mix. All qPCRs were performed using the QuantStudio 1 (Applied Biosystems) or 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) apparatuses. The thermocycling conditions involved a 2 min, 50 \u00b0C and 10 min, 95 \u00b0C holding stage, followed by 40 cycles of 95 and 60 \u00b0C for 15 s and 1 min, respectively. Gene copy number was calculated relative to the DNA standard, whereby 10-fold dilutions of 109 VACV-mCh genomes were used to generate standard curves for A23R and mCherry. Note that calculations for the DNA concentration to genome copy number conversion were done using a known VACV WR sequence (NCBI #NC_006998).Immunofluorescence analysisTo examine viral factory formation, immunofluorescence assays were performed. 293A cells were seeded on glass coverslips that had been pre-coated with Poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. At 70\u201380% confluency, cells were transfected with the appropriate Cas9-gRNA complexes, as described above. Four hours post-transfection, media was replaced with D2 for 16 h, before infecting cells with VACV-mCh (MOI 0.5) in D2. Infections were allowed to progress for the specified times before fixation of cells in 1% (v/v) PFA. To confirm the presence of infection, fixed cells were blocked in 1% (w/v) BSA and 2% (v/v) FBS in PBS for 20 min. Samples were then probed with a rabbit anti-VACV antibody and a corresponding secondary, anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (Silenus, 1:200)37. Nucleic acids were visualised with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1:10,000). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with a mounting media containing 10% (w/v) Mowiol (Poly(vinyl alcohol)) 4\u201388, 25% (w/v) glycerol and 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and allowed to dry overnight prior to examination. All fixed cell imaging was conducted on the Zeiss Axio Observer wide-field microscope and the Leica SP5 confocal system.Live-cell imagingFor live-cell imaging, the IncuCyte Live Cell S3 system (Sartorius) was used. Briefly, the CRISPR/Cas9 selection protocol was followed as described above with cells at 70\u201380% confluency. All imaging was then conducted using the 6-well plate format, with micrographs taken at 20 min intervals from 1 to 72 hpi. During this time cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. ImageJ software (v1.53) was used to annotate video files.Plaque isolation of virus and PCR screeningTo screen viral plaques in our marker-free model of CRISPR selection, we used a standard PCR screening method. Briefly, following Cas9 selection, viruses were grown on BS-C-1 cells, single plaques were identified by microscopy and cells and virus were collected with a pipette and added to D2 media for expansion before testing by PCR. This involved freeze-thawing three times, before plating these virus isolates onto uninfected BS-C-1 cells in a 96-well plate and allowing viral replication to progress for 3 days. At this point, cells were lysed by addition of proteinase K (10 \u03bcg/mL) diluted in 1X ThermoPol buffer (New England Biolabs) and PBS. Following a freeze-thaw step at \u221280 \u00b0C, lysates were heated at 56 \u00b0C for 20 min, then 85 \u00b0C for 10 min. DNA obtained in this manner was used as template for a PCR with insertion specific Spi2 screening primers (Spi2 screening FW: 5\u2032-GAAGAATTCAAGCTTATGTAAAAGG-3\u2032, Spi2 REV: 5\u2032-CTTACATCTACCATTTCCGTCG-3\u2032) and the presence of bands was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Spi2 PCR products were also digested overnight with HindIII to confirm the presence of the inserted 20 bp by RFLP analysis on agarose gels. Note for this experiment, PCR primers used were a FW primer specific to both wild-type and recombinant Spi2 (Spi2 sequencing FW: 5\u2032-GTATTCATTTCTCCAGCGTCA-3\u2032) with the Spi2 REV used above.Sanger sequencingTo sequence the Spi2 region of the VACV genome, a DNA fragment was amplified by standard PCR using the Spi2 sequencing FW and Spi2 REV primers described above. The amplified fragment was separated from the primers using agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently purified by gel extraction according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Machery-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean Up Kit). DNA yield and purity was assessed by Nanodrop spectrophotometry (ThermoFisher). For sequencing, a 20 \u03bcL reaction containing 40 ng DNA, 1 \u03bcL BigDye Terminator (ThermoFisher), 3.2 pmol Spi2 FW sequencing primer and 3.5 \u00b5L 5X sequencing buffer. Samples were cycle sequenced at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of 96 \u00b0C (10 s), 50 \u00b0C (5 s) and 60 \u00b0C (4 min), then a 4 \u00b0C hold stage. Prior to Sanger sequencing using the AB3730 capillary sequencer, DNA was ethanol precipitated and air-dried. All sequencing was then performed by the Australian Cancer Research Foundation Biomolecular Resource Facility (BRF) at the Australian National University.Statistics and reproducibilitySample sizes were determined based on the assay. For virus plaque analysis, 30\u201350 plaques are considered standard for analysis. We increased this number to 100 to gain a better insight into virus frequencies within mixed populations. For flow cytometry analysis, 25,000 cells were considered sufficient per sample. All other samples were analysed in their entirety. All experiments were replicated 2\u20133 times independently.All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (v8.4.2) software. Typically, one- or two-way ANOVA were used with a Tukey post-test to make multiple pair-wise comparisons, or where appropriate a Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. Unless stated otherwise error bars refer to SD.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Drug Sensitivity Assay of Xanthomonas. citri subsp. citri Using REMA Plate Method", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.861", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Prepare Stock Solutions"}, "1.1": "Prepare stock solutions of chemicals (dried-powder samples) dissolving in 10% in DMSO (diluted in sterile water).", "2": {"title": "Prepare 96-Well Plate"}, "2.1": "Add 100ul of water to columns 1 and 12 to avoid evaporation (Table 1).", "2.2": {"title": "Dilute Stock Solutions"}, "2.2.1": "Dilute the stock solutions in LB medium directly in a 96-well plate using a 2-fold scheme (final volume of 100~ul per well).", "2.2.2": "After serial dilution, the most concentrated sample should have a maximum of 1% DMSO.", "3": {"title": "Cell Growth"}, "3.1": "Grow cells in LB medium at 30~^\u00b0C under rotation (200 rpm) until OD600 0.6 (log phase).", "3.2": {"title": "Add Bacterial Inoculum"}, "3.2.1": "Add 10ul of bacterial inoculum (standardized to 10^5 CFU/well).", "3.2.2": {"title": "Controls"}, "3.2.2.1": "Negative control: 1% DMSO dissolved in LB.", "3.2.2.2": "Positive control: Kanamycin at 15.6 ug/ml.", "4": {"title": "Incubation and Measurement"}, "4.1": "Incubate the test plates at 30^\u00b0C for 6h.", "4.2": "Add 15ul of a 0.01% (w/v) resazurin solution, and incubate at 30~^\u00b0C for 2h.", "4.3": "Measure fluorescence at 530 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission) using a fluorescence scanner.", "5": {"title": "Calculate Percentage of Inhibition"}, "5.1": "Calculate the percentage of inhibition using the formula: (average FU negative control) - (average FU test)/(average FU negative control) x 100 FU: Fluorescence Units.", "6": {"title": "Determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)"}, "6.1": "Conduct three independent experiments and use the data to construct plots of chemical concentration versus cell growth inhibition.", "6.2": "Determine the MIC, defined as the lowest concentration of the antibiotic able to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms."}, "text_flat": "Drug Sensitivity Assay of Xanthomonas. citri subsp. citri Using REMA Plate Method\n\n1.

Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Margate, UK) ages 10\u201312 weeks (22\u201326 g) were used (n = 132 in total) for all protocols.In vitro production and labelling of MVsTo provide a defined, inflammation-relevant and abundant source of MVs for in vivo tracking studies in mice, we used the semi-adherent J774A.1 macrophage cell line (ECACC, UK: ECACC-91051511) which produces EVs rapidly in response to extracellular ATP stimulation via the P2X7 receptor signalling pathway [26]. Activation of the P2X7 receptor by a typical danger signal ATP is a potent stimulus for MV release and is central to the development of sterile and infectious inflammation and tissue injury [31]. Confluent cells in 60 mm tissue culture dishes were rinsed multiple times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, with calcium and magnesium) to remove any cellular debris and EVs, and then stimulated for 30 min, with 3 mM ATP (Bio-Techne, UK) in PBS at 37\u00b0C. Although more prolonged exposure (>2 h) to ATP at this concentration can produce non-apoptotic cytotoxicity in J774 cells [32], and other cell types [33], viability was high (>90%) in cells harvested from plates after this brief ATP stimulation, in agreement with the previous study [32]. Released EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation in an Eppendorf angle rotor (FA45-30-11) microfuge at 300 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min to pellet cells, followed by medium speed centrifugation of the supernatant at 20,800 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min to enrich MVs in pellets. EV preparations were labelled with 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK), a lipophilic, far-red fluorescent dye previously used in in vivo and in vitro EV uptake studies [34\u201336] The pellet was resuspended with PBS, 0.5% clinical-grade human albumin solution (HAS) and incubated at room temperature with DiD, prediluted (30 \u00b5M) in Diluent C (Sigma), at a final concentration 5 \u00b5M for 7 min. The mixture was then further diluted with PBS-HAS and washed twice by centrifugation (20,800 \u00d7 g, 15 min) with careful removal of supernatant to remove unbound DiD. MV-specific DiD staining was assessed by flow cytometry in combination with plasma membrane markers and comparison to typical exosome markers. To assess levels of MV incorporated DiD versus unbound DiD, labelled and washed preparations were incubated with anti-CD11b immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 1 \u00d7 108 DiD/CD45/CD11b-positive events per 50 \u00b5l of microbeads for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Application to magnetized LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) was followed by collection of unbound flow-through and column-bound fractions. DiD fluorescence was measured in PBS, Triton X-100 (0.5%) at 635 nm/680 nm excitation/emission in a Biotek FLx800 plate reader.LiposomesLiposomes were supplied by Encapsula NanoSciences (Brentwood, TN, USA) as phosphatidylcholine only (PC-liposomes) and phosphatidylcholine and PS at a 1:1 molar ratio (\u201cPS-liposomes\u201d) sized to 100 nm using high-pressure argon extrusion. DiD labelling of PS-liposomes for in vivo experiments was performed as for MVs.In vivo model of subclinical endotoxemia and MV challengeSub-clinical endotoxemia was induced by single, low-dose LPS (20 ng, Ultrapure Escherichia coli O111:B4; InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) i.v. injection [21]. For determination of MV uptake, a standardized dose of DiD-labelled MVs (2.4 \u00d7 105 fluorescence units/200 \u00b5l, equivalent to a count of ~1.0 \u00d7 108 MVs) suspended in PBS was injected i.v. via the tail vein to either untreated or LPS-pretreated mice. After 1 h, mice were anesthetized, heparinized and exsanguinated, before rapid excision and processing of total lung and spleen, and a weighed portion of the liver, for flow cytometric analysis.Macrophage depletion in vivoIntravascular-resident macrophages and monocytes were depleted by i.v. injection of 0.2 ml of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA). MV challenge experiments were performed after 72 h when vascular Ly6Chigh monocytes were repopulated from the bone marrow reservoir but before significant restoration of blood Ly6Clow monocytes [21,37,38], or liver and splenic macrophages (Supplementary Figure S1) [39,40].Isolated perfused lung (IPL)For assessing pulmonary intravascular uptake of MVs in isolation from the systemic circulation, mouse IPL was performed as described by us in recent publications [41,42]. In brief, untreated or low-dose LPS pretreated (i.v., 20 ng, 2 h) mice were injected i.p. with xylaxine (13 mg/kg)/ketamine (130 mg/kg) to induce general anaesthesia, injected i.v. via a tail vein with 20 IU of heparin, and the trachea intubated and connected to the ventilator on continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H2O. After exsanguination via the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary artery and left atrium were cannulated and perfusion performed with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 4% clinical-grade human albumin solution at a slow rate of 0.1 ml/min increasing gradually to a constant flow rate of 25 ml/kg/min with an open, non-recirculating circuit to remove blood and loosely marginated cells in a total perfusate volume of 3 ml. Perfusion was then switched to the closed, recirculating circuit (volume 2.5 ml) and the same fluorescence-standardized dose of MVs as used in vivo was infused via the perfusion circuit reservoir and recirculated for 1 h.In vitro MV uptake assayMechanisms of MV uptake were investigated in vitro using leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation as the most anatomically relevant and abundant source, contrasting with blood where monocytopenia severely limits cell recovery during endotoxemia. Following terminal anaesthesia and heparinization, inflated lungs were perfused with HBSS (without Ca2+/Mg2+)-albumin (4%) via the pulmonary artery at a high constant flow of 50 ml/h for 12 min for maximal recovery of blood and marginated cells from the left atrium. Based on preliminary evaluations of MV uptake (Supplementary Figure S2), in vitro incubations of MVs with washed perfusate cells were performed at standardized density of 5 \u00d7 104 Ly6Chigh monocytes/ml in HBBS-HAS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) in Eppendorfs with continuous mixing for 1 h.Flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions were prepared from excised tissue as described previously [43] with minor modifications. Tissues were disaggregated in formaldehyde fixative in MACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) with a gentleMACS\u2122 Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Ltd., Bisley, UK) for 1 min. For cell counts, ice-cold flow cytometry wash buffer (PBS, 2% FCS, 0.1 mM sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA) was added directly to suspensions, or for DiD detection, after a further 5 min fixation at room temperature. This method of combining rapid tissue disaggregation and cell dispersal with simultaneous fixation aimed to minimize any MV binding and internalization at the point of tissue harvest, contrasting with standard enzyme-based tissue disaggregation methods that require relatively prolonged incubations at 37\u00b0C. For quantification of cell surface receptor expression, single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzyme digestion with collagenase A (1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNAse1 (0.1 mg/ml, Roche) at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. Cell suspensions were sieved through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer (Greiner Bio-One, UK) and washed prior to antibody staining. The following specificity fluorophore-conjugated rat anti-mouse (unless stated otherwise) mAbs were used: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (BM8), Ly-6G (1A8), Ly-6C (HK1.4), NK-1.1 (PK136), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), CD31 (MEC13.3), CD41 (MWReg30), MerTK (2B10C42), TIM4 (RMT4-54), CD51 (RMV-7), CD9 (MZ3), CD63 (NVG-2), LAMP2 (M3/84), hamster anti-CD61 (HM\u03b23-1), CD68 (FA-11), CD36 (HM36), CD81 (Eat-2) all from Biolegend (London, UK); human anti-CD204 (REA148) from Miltenyi Biotec Ltd.; and anti-MARCO (ED31) from Bio-Rad (Watford, UK). Gating strategies for intravascular monocyte subsets and neutrophils were based on CD11b, Ly6G, Ly6C, F4/80, MHCII, NK1.1 staining as previously described [41,43,44]. Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages were identified as CD45+, CD11b-low/med and F4/80+ [45] (Supplementary Figure S1) and endothelial cells as CD31-positive and CD41/CD45-negative [22]. Cell counts were determined using Accucheck counting beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were acquired using a Cyan ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), with EV events acquired using a side scatter trigger threshold. Analysis of data was performed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). MV uptake for each cell population was quantified as cell-associated DiD mean (geometric) fluorescence intensity (MFI). Total MV uptake per organ was calculated as: [cell-associated DiD MFI for each mouse \u2013 group mean background fluorescence (untreated mice) MFI] \u00d7 group mean cell count/organ.Confocal microscopyCell suspensions were treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (Miltenyi Biotech Ltd.) and leukocytes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Washed cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Ly6C biotin-conjugated mAb (clone HK1.4, BioLegend) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by Alexa Fluor-488 streptavidin (BioLegend) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were cytospin-centrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides (Sigma) and mounted with ProLong\u2122 Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope, with Zeiss KS-300 software and analysed using FIJI software.Data analysisNormality was determined using QQ plots and Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests using IBM SPSS 25 software. Group comparisons were made by Student\u2019s t-tests, by ANOVA with Bonferroni tests, or by Friedman with Dunn\u2019s tests, using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD or median with interquartile ranges (median \u00b1 IQR).

Final extension 5 min 72^\u00b0C * The temperature of annealing depends upon the oligonucleotides used and the extension time at 72^\u00b0C on the length of the fragment amplified. Footprints on fragments greater than 500 bp are not recommended and so 30 sec is usually good for most fragments.10. Test 12 ul on small agarose gel (containing ethidium bromide or other suitable DNA detection reagent) for amplification of a fragment of the correct size and check you have a fragment of the correct size in good yield (i.e. most or all of the oligos have been used up) 30 pmoles of oligos can give maximally 2u of a fragment of 100 bp and 10 u of a fragment 500 bp.  Proceed to purification. In theory you can use the PCR as it is or after passage through a spin column. However any minor, shorter length contaminants will produce artifactual bands in the footprint and the presence of unincorporated radioactivity will not allow you to estimate the amount of radioactive DNA in the footprinting reactions. So we always proceed to purify the labeled DNA from an agarose gel. In exceptional cases e.g. to eliminate a close running contaminant band from a short (100-200 bp) fragment, the fragments can be purified on a native acrylamide gel (see step A-14 below).11. Run the PCR mixture, mixed with 10~ul of loading dyes, on a small 1% agarose gel in 50 mM TBE buffer. Usually the whole 50ul PCR can be loaded in 3 wells.12. Visualize the gel on a long wavelength (365n m) transilluminator (to minimize damage to the DNA by short wavelength) and cut out the agarose containing the radioactive fragment. Discard rest of gel as radioactive waste.13. Extract the DNA from agarose using a gel purification kit (e.g. Machery-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up). Elute in 50ul elution buffer.14. To purify the DNA from an acrylamide gel: run the PCR mix on a native acrylamide gel ( 5.8% depending upon size in 50~m M TBE at room temperature i.e. do not allow the gel to heat up. Depending upon the size of the apparatus used 100-200 volts should be adequate). Locate the radioactive DNA by short exposure of the wet gel wrapped in Saran wrap to a phosphorimager screen (or X-ray film). The piece of acrylamide containing the radioactive band is cut out and the radioactive DNA eluted by shaking overnight at 37~^\u00b0C in 1 m of 0.5~M~ ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA. Separate the aqueous phase from the acrylamide gel piece by centrifugation and transfer to another tube. Extract with 0.5~ml phenol/CHCl3 and precipitate the DNA with 2.5 volumes ethanol in dry ice for at least 30 m i n . Centrifuge 10 min 4 ^\u00b0C , remove all the supernatant, dry in vacuo 2-3 m i n ) Resuspend in 50~ul elution buffer (as for DNA eluted from agarose.).15. Run 1~ul on a new small agarose gel and estimate the quantity by comparison to the staining intensity of marker DNAs (e.g. 100 bp ladder).16. Count 1 \u03bcl by Kerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter or estimate using a Geiger counter. Expect to have 50,000-150,000 cpm/ul with about 5-50 ng DNA/\u03bcl (yield in range 10\u201350% of  the  moles  of  starting  oligonucleotide.)  You  can  calculate  the  molar concentration of the DNA fragment from the length of the fragment in bp and using 1 bp corresponds to a molecular mass of 660.# B.  The footprinting reaction.  All protein and DNA dilutions are made in 1x binding buffer. Protein dilutions are made at 4^\u00b0C to minimize any instability of the protein in dilute solutions. Binding reactions can be made at RT or at 30~^\u00b0C or 37~^\u00b0C depending upon the experiment. E.g. most prokaryotic transcription factors bind DNA at RT. E.coli RNA polymerase will only form open complexes at 37^\u00b0C .2.  The binding buffer we usually use is Hepes-Glutamate. The concentration of K glutamate can be increased or decreased according to the experiment; generally higher salt favors specificity but decreases affinity.  M g++ salts (1-10 mM) can be added according to the experiment, e.g. M g_++ is required for RNA polymerase binding. The BSA is added to stabilize dilute proteins and prevent non-specific absorption to the microfuge tube. The reaction mix in general consists of 20ul DNA solution to which we add 20ul of the diluted protein (if several components need to be tested at the same time the volume for each component can be reduced accordingly to give a final volume of 40ul) ).3.  To test a range of protein concentrations for binding to the labeled DNA. Make a suitable volume of binding buffer and keep on ice. Prepare a series of dilution tubes for the protein to test over a range of concentrations. This range depends entirely on the protein under study as binding constants can vary from nM to nearly mM. E.g. for 10 serial dilution of ^1/_2 concentration each step, Prepare 10 tubes with 25ul binding buffer on ice.4.  Prepare a suitable volume of labeled DNA e.g. For 12 reactions prepare 240~ul binding buffer and add labeled DNA fragment to have about 20,000 -100,000 cpm/reaction. Mix well. Ideally this should give a final concentration of the DNA of about 1 nM in the 40~ul footprinting reaction, if binding constants of protein to DNA are in the nM range.5.  Dispense 20ul of the DNA mix into 12.5ml microtubes at RT.6.  Make the protein dilutions on ice and immediately mix the diluted protein with the DNA at RT. E.g. Dilute the protein to 1 uM in 50~ul binding buffer. a.  Add 20~ul to one tube of DNA (to give final concentration of 500n M ). Mix by pipetting. Leave at RT until finished all mixes. b.  Take 25ul of the 1 uM dilution and mix with 25ul binding buffer in next dilution tube. c.  Add 20ul of this dilution to the next DNA tube (final concentration 250 nM). d.  Take 25ul of the 0.5uM dilution and mix with 25ul binding buffer in next dilution tube. e.  Continue for the whole series of 10 dilutions.7.  Add 20 u/ \u00d7 binding buffer to two DNA samples for the (essential) controls without protein.8.  Incubate for 10 min at RT (or at chosen temperature for chosen time).9.  Meanwhile prepare a suitable dilution of DNase I in DNase I dilution buffer. It is crucial to find the correct DNase I concentration to get limited DNase attack so that not all the DNA is degraded. As there should in theory be no more than 1 break/DNA strand, the majority (80-90%) ) of the DNA should be full length.It is usually necessary to make a pilot experiment with each new stock of DNase I to test a series of dilutions of DNase I with a DNA fragment (in the absence of binding proteins) to find the concentration which gives an adequate ladder but leaves full length DNA at the top of the gel. The amount of DNase I used should be lower for longer DNA fragments. The amount given below is a guideline only.10. DNase I stock of 5mg/ml in DNase I storage buffer (store in aliquots at -20^\u00b0C_, ). Dilute about 10,000 fold (e.g. 2~ul to 200~ul , in DNase I dilution buffer, then take 2~ul of the first dilution to 200ul DNase I dilution buffer) to give 0.5u/ m l .11. To make the footprint reactions: T=0 add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 1. Mix gently by pipetting. T=15 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 2. Mix gently by pipetting.  T=30 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 3. Mix gently by pipetting.  T=45 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 4. Mix gently by pipetting. T=60 sec Add 100ul phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 1. Vortex to stop reaction T=75 sec Add 100 \u03bcl phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 2. Vortex to stop reaction. T=90 sec Add 100ul phenol pH 8.0 to the footprint mix 3. Vortex to stop reaction. T=105 sec Add 100ul phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 4. Vortex to stop reaction. Repeat until all the tubes have been treated. Precise timings are crucial to get precise and comparable DNase I digestions in each lane (some researchers prefer to use longer times and more dilute DNase I).12. Add 200ul DNase I STOP solution to each reaction. Vortex well.13. Centrifuge 10 min RT.14. Transfer the aqueous upper phase (careful not to take any phenol) to a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube.15. Add 600 \u03bcl 96% ethanol. Mix well and incubate in dry ice for 1 h (or overnight at -80~^\u00b0C_iota ).16. Centrifuge 15 min, 4^\u00b0C , 12,000\u00d7 g. .17. Remove the supernatant carefully with a pipette and 1 ml pipette tip. Depending upon the number of cpm used per reaction and the sensitivity of the available Geiger counter, verify that some radioactivity is in the (invisible) pellet with a Geiger counter. If the herring sperm DNA, used in the DNase I STOP to aid precipitation, has not been sufficiently sonicated or too much has been used, the DNA pellet might not adhere to the microfuge tube and can be lost with the ethanol.18. Centrifuge again, 5 min 4^\u00b0C . Remove the rest of the liquid with a 20~ul pipette tip. Verify that the radioactivity is still in the tube.19. Dry in vacuo 5 min.20. Resuspend in 5 ul H_2O and add 6 \u03bcl gel loading formamide dyes (deionized formamide with Bromophenol blue and Xylene cyanol). Vortex well. Quick centrifuge to put all liquid in bottom of tube.21. Heat to 90~^\u00b0C for 2 min.  Quench in ice and immediately load (5~ul) onto a denaturing (7 M urea) acrylamide sequencing gel, acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide), which has been prerun for 30 min to 1 h to get hot. Voltage and wattage depends upon the apparatus used. We use 60 watts for the Model S2. Use with 5-10% final concentration acrylamide depending on the size of the fragment under investigation.22. To locate the site of protein binding it is necessary to calibrate gels with molecular weight markers. E.g. DNA marker pBR322 digested with MspI, treated with alkaline phosphatase (e.g. Antarctic alkaline phosphatase) and labeled with \u03b3- ^32P ATP and PNK or a sequencing ladder prepared using the same Oligo 1, which was used for the radioactive labeling of the fragment.23. Electrophorese at 60 watts for a 30\u00d730 plates and 1 mM thick gels using the Model S2 apparatus. Adjust volts and power for other sized gels. Time of migration depends upon the size of the fragment and expected position of protein binding sites (generally 80 min to 3 h).24. After migration, allow to cool slightly, open plates, transfer the gel to Whatman 3 m m paper. Cover with Saran wrap and dry on a gel drying apparatus.25. Put the dried gel, still covered with Saran to expose in a Phosphorimager cassette overnight (alternatively expose to X-ray film with an intensifying screen).26. The pattern of DNase I cleavages with and without protein indicates the site of protein binding (Figure 1). Deformations such as bent or looped DNA are indicated by hypersensitive cleavages compared to the control (free DNA), since bending of the DNA has facilitated attack by DNase I in the wider minor groove formed on the outside of the loop or bend (Figure 2).()A.

Principle of DNase I footprinting()# Figure 2. Example of DNase I footprinting27. Using the Image Quant program, it is possible to quantify the amount of radioactivity in specific bands or regions, corresponding to protein protected sites and non-protected regions, and hence to derive binding constants for the proteins.# Recipes1.
