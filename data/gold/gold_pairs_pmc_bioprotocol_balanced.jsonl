The clinical isolate A. baumannii AB41was kindly provided by Dr. Jordi Vila from the University of Barcelona. Unless otherwise stated, for TEM studies, Pseudomonas PAO1 was grown in Tryticase soy agar (TSA, Oxoid) and A. baumannii in Columbia blood agar (Oxoid), and both were incubated at 37°C for 18h, while N. gonorrhoeae was grown in chocolate agar (CHOC, Oxoid) at 37°C for 48h. For membrane vesicle isolation, Pseudomonas PAO1 was grown in Trypticase soy broth (TSB, Oxoid) at 37°C for 5 hours, A. baumannii AB41 in Müeller-Hinton broth (MH, Oxoid) at 30°C for 15h, and both liquid cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. Membrane vesicles from N. gonorrhoeae were retrieved from confluent cultures grown in chocolate agar plates (CHOC) for 65h at 37°C.MV Isolation and purification from culture media A. baumannii AB41 and Pseudomonas PAO1 naturally secrete MVs into media. MVs from both strains were collected from broth cultures (500 ml) in the late log phase using an adaptation of the method described by McBroom and coworkers [23]. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size filters to remove remaining bacterial cells. MVs were obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in an Avanti J-20 XP centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 6.8 (Sigma) and filtered through 0.22-μm-pore-size Ultrafree spin filters (Millipore). Vesicles were again pelleted and finally resuspended in an adequate volume of 50 mM HEPES, pH 6.8 (Sigma). MVs from N. gonorrhoeae were collected from confluent solid cultures grown on CHOC plates. Cells and MVs from 20 agar plates were resuspended in 15 ml of Ringer ¼ (Sigma) per plate and from this moment the MVs were obtained as described for liquid media cultures.For proteomic studies, MVs from N. gonorrhoeae were further purified by ultracentrifugation in OptiPrep gradients as described by Pérez-Cruz et al. [22].TEM observation after High-Pressure Freezing and Freeze Substitution (HPF-FS)TEM observations of the three strains and their isolated MVs were performed as described by Pérez-Cruz et al [22]. Briefly, bacterial colonies were cryoimmobilized using a Leica EMPact high-pressure freezer (Leica, Vienna, Austria). Frozen samples were freeze-substituted in a Leica EM automatic freeze substitution (AFS) system (Leica, Vienna, Austria), where the substitution was performed in pure acetone containing 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide and 0.1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate at −90°C for 72 h. The temperature was gradually increased (5°C/h) to 4°C, held constant for 2 h, and then finally increased to room temperature and maintained for 1 h. Samples were washed for 1 h in acetone at room temperature and infiltrated in a graded series of Epon-acetone mixtures, and pure Epon 812 (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 30 h. Samples were embedded in fresh Epon and polymerized at 60°C for 48 h. Epon-embedded thin sections were examined in a Tecnai Spirit electron microscope (FEI Company, Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.Cryo-TEM observation of pathogenic bacteria cultures and their isolated MVsBacterial suspensions containing MVs from N. gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas PAO1 and A. baumannii AB41 were visualized by Cryo-TEM. Pseudomonas PAO1 and A. baumannii AB41 were incubated overnight in 50 mL of TSB medium. For N. gonorrhoeae, confluent CHOC agar cultures were incubated for 24 hours and resuspended in 50 ml in PBS. For all strains, a large part of the cells were gently removed by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes. The remaining cells and MVs from each strain were sedimented from the supernatants by high-speed centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 30 minutes in an Avanti J-20 XP centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc). The pellet was washed with 50 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 6.8 and centrifuged again at 40,000 x g. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in an adequate volume of 50 mM HEPES pH 6.8 for Cryo-TEM observation. For that purpose, the suspension was adjusted to a turbidity equivalent to 1 McFarland standard. For Cryo-TEM observation of isolated MVs without cells, samples were prepared as described in the above method for MV Isolation and purification from culture media. In all Cryo-TEM analysis, five microliters of the corresponding suspension were applied on freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R 2/2 grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany). The sample was allowed to adhere to the grids for 1 minute. The excess of liquid was then blotted with filter paper, leaving the sample films spanning the grid holes. The samples were vitrified by plunging the grid into ethane, which was kept at melting point with nitrogen using a Vitroblot (FEI Company, Eindhoven, Netherlands), and maintained before freezing at 100% humidity and room temperature. The vitreous sample films were transferred to a Tecnai F20 microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, Netherlands), using a Gatan cryotransfer system (Gatan Inc. Pleasanton, CA). Cryo-TEM visualizations were carried out at a temperature between −170°C and −175°C and at the accelerating voltage of 200kV. Images were acquired using low-dose imaging conditions and an Eagle 4k x 4k Images charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (FEI Company, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The different type of vesicles and the diameters were analyzed using Image J software [24]. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.Proteomic analysis of MVs from N. gonorrhoeae A proteomic analysis of purified MVs from N. gonorrhoeae was carried out using one-dimensional (1-D) SDS-PAGE and nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis as described by Pérez-Cruz et al. with some modifications [22]. Briefly, proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel matrix, pooled, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried-down peptide mixture was analyzed in a nanoAcquity liquid chromatographer (Waters) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. A database was created merging all Uniprot-SwissProt and Uniprot-TrEMBL entries for Neisseria gonorrhoeae with Uniprot-Swissprot all (September 2013). The software Thermo Proteome Discover (v.1.3.0.339) was used to perform a search by the Sequest search engine against this database. The results were filtered and only proteins identified with at least 2 high confidence peptides (FDR≤ 0.01) were included. Bacterial protein subcellular localization was predicted with the software PSORTb v3.0.2 [25].Fluorometric DNA quantificationSurface-associated DNA and DNA contained within MVs were quantified by the PicoGreen assay (Molecular Probes) as described by Pérez-Cruz et al. [22]. MVs were collected from three independent experiments. For each experiment, two 30-μg protein samples from MVs were prepared. One was pretreated with 50 μg/ml pancreatic DNase I (Sigma) and 10mM MgCl2 (1 h at 37°C) to digest DNA located outside the OMVs. Both MVs samples were lysed with 0.125% Triton X-100 solution. Samples were further processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and fluorescence was measured in a Modulus Microplate Multimode Reader (Turner Biosystems). Each experiment was performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).DNA Immunolabeling of MVs from N. gonorrhoeae thin sectionsHPF-FS of isolated MVs from N. gonorrhoeae was carried out as described previously by Pérez-Cruz et al. [22]. Colloidal gold immunolabeling of Lowicryl-HM20 thin sections was carried out as follows. Grids were pre-treated with a solution of 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) to expose the DNA before the immunolabeling. Unless specified, washing steps were carried out by floating the grids face down on the drops. Grids with sections were floated on 0.1 M PBS for 3 min. The grids were blocked on 0.1 M PBS–50 mM glycine and rinsed with 0.1 M PBS, again with 2.5% BSA–0.1 M PBS (1 drop for 3 min and 1 drop for 12 min), and again with 1% BSA–0.1 M PBS (1 drop for 8 s). Next, the grids were incubated with monoclonal IgM specific for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (clone AC-30–10; Novus Biologicals), diluted 1/2 in 0.1% BSA–0.1 M PBS, for 1 h. Grids were washed for 5 min on 5 drops of 0.25% Tween 20–0.1 M PBS, followed by 3 min on 1 drop of 0.1% BSA–0.1 M PBS. After that, grids were incubated for 30 min with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to 12-nm colloidal gold (lot 84359; Jackson) diluted 1/20 in 0.1% BSA–0.1 M PBS. Grids were washed with 0.1 M PBS, followed by double-distilled water and then floated on 1% glutaraldehyde–0.1 M PBS for 5 min. Grids were rinsed with double-distilled water and dried with filter paper. Finally, grids were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate–methanol for 5 min, 70% methanol for 3 min, 50% methanol for 3 min, and 30% methanol for 3 min, jet-washed with double-distilled water, air dried for 20 min, stained with lead citrate for 2 min, and jet-washed with double-distilled water. Two controls were used. First, the dsDNA monoclonal antibody was omitted. Second, the grids were preincubated at 37°C for 16 h with 1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) in PBS plus 7 mM MgCl2, and then the grids were thoroughly washed with water before immunolabeling with the dsDNA monoclonal antibody.Luminescent quantification of ATPATP contained in MVs was measured by a BacTiter-Glo Microbial Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Isolated MVs were retrieved from exponential growing cultures as described above and samples were stored at −80°C to avoid ATP degradation. Aliquots of each MV preparation from the three assayed strains were inoculated into the corresponding fresh culture media and incubated overnight at 37°C to check for bacterial contamination. 100 μl of isolated MVs were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the luminescence was measured in Modulus Microplate Multimode Reader (Turner Biosystems). The standard curve was prepared from 1 μM of Adenosine 5’-triphosphate sodium salt (Promega) initial solution and 10-fold serial dilutions were done (1 μM to 10 pM). ATP concentrations in MV samples were determined by comparing the signal emitted with the ATP standard curve for each assay. The protein concentration of each sample was determined. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and the ATP content was normalized by protein concentration.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC4291224.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Assay of Arabinofuranosidase Activity in Maize Roots","text":"Assay of Arabinofuranosidase Activity in Maize Roots\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) were sterilized in 5% (w/w) solution of NaOCl for 10 min then were washed twice in water. Seeds were placed in the cells of plastic grid that was mounted in a tray with water. Plants were grown in the dark in a thermostat at 27^°C for96 h. While any part of etiolated seedling can be used for the assay, we have used five zones (meristem, early elongation, elongation, late elongation, post-elongation) of primary roots (Figure 1). The recommended amount of plant material in each sample is 30-40 mg. One mm of maize root represents approximately one mg of fresh weight. Thus, root pieces of 10m m length from three or four seedlings or pieces of 1-mm length from 30-40 seedlings are enough for one replica.2. 30-40 mg of fresh plant material was homogenized with mortar and pestle on ice in 1 ml of 50 mM NaOAc buffer (p H6.0) with 3 m M of dithiothreitol to prevent the intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds formation and with 0.03%(W/W)N a N_3 to restrict bacterial contamination. Homogenate was transferred to microcentrifuge tube (1.5-2ml) ). Homogenates that were already prepared could be stored in a refrigerator (-20~^°C) while other samples are being done.3.  1 ml of suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000x g . Then 100ul of supernatant were separated for further estimation of protein content according to Bradford (1976) (step 9) and free arabinose content estimation (step 10). Supernatants could be stored in a refrigerator (-20~^°) . Steps 9-10 could be carried out later. The arabinose and protein contents do not change if samples are frozen.4.  Pellet was resuspended in the remaining 900~ul of buffer solution using Vortex. Plant material was not separated from supernatant because of the potential presence of wallassociated arabinofuranosidases that might be not extracted by the buffer solution. The suspension was divided into two equal parts ( 450~ul each) that were transferred to plastic tubes as control and trial variants of each sample.5. 50~ul of 10~m M 4NPA in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 was added to the trial tubes, and 50~ul of 0.03%(W/W)N a N_3 to the control tubes. Both of the variants were incubated in the thermoshaker  at  600  rpm  at 37 °Sigma for  2  h.  During  that  time  cell  wall arabinofuranosidases (either soluble or wall-associated) in trial tubes removed arabinose residues from 4NPA molecules producing yellow-colored NP. Enzymes in control tubes had no chromogenic substrate for reaction.6.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500~ul of 1 M Na2CO3 both to the control and to the trial tubes. The coloration of the solution has become more pronounced at that moment due to increased pH (11.5).7.  Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000× g. Optical densities of both trial and control supernatants were measured on a spectrophotometer at wavelength 405~n m . The control mean was subtracted from the trial mean. The result was used for the determination of the amount of liberated NP according to calibration.8.  Calibration measurements were done for NP solutions with concentrations in a range from 0.0025m M to 0.25mM (Figure 3). 500ul of 1 M N a_2C O_3 were added to 500ul of each NP solution, because it enhances the coloration.9.  Determination of protein content.a.  490 μl of water was added to 10~ul aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample. 500~ul of Bradford dye reagent was also added to each microcentrifuge tube and then mixed using vortex.b.   After 5 min each sample was read on a spectrophotometer at 595n m .10. Determination of free arabinose content.a. 90~ul of water was added to 10~ul aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample.b. 25~ul of obtained solution was directly injected to the column of HPAEC system without any pretreatment.c. 15m MN a O H (buffer A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (buffer B) were used as eluents. The column temperature was maintained at 30~^°C , and the elution rate was 1 ml/min. The gradient elution was performed as follows: 0-20 min- 100% A; 20-21 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio =90:10(%) ; 21-31 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio =70:30(%) ; 31-32 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio 0:100(%) ; 32-42 min- 100% B; 42-43 min-until the A/B ratio = : 100;0(%) . Column was equilibrated with eluent 100% A for 30m i n .d.  Arabinose content was determined by the area of the corresponding peak using the PeakNet software and the calibration for arabinose standard.11. Calibration for free arabinose was done using solutions with concentrations in a range 2-10 u9/ m I .()amount of nitrophenol (NP) matter in reaction media (1 m) , μmol/mlFigure 3. Calibration for different nitrophenol (NP) concentrations. Do not confuse the concentration and the amount of NP matter in reaction volume (see Table 1).# Notes1.  Experiments should be repeated three-four times for each sample.2.  One unit of arabinofuranosidase activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme that liberates one μmol of NP per minute. Differences of glycosyl-hydrolase activities between samples can be defined by using the units of enzymatic activity per mg of total proteins. Exact formula for arabinofuranosidase activity calculation is given in Figure 4.()Figure 4. Formula for calculation of arabinofuranosidases activity. The result will be obtained in milliUnits of activity per mg of protein content.3.  Described protocol with small modifications can be used for determination of any other glycosyl-hydrolase activity with synthetic aryl glycosides. Preliminary experiments may be useful for the optimization of incubation time and of plant material amount. However, the enzyme activity that is measured only by the rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis can remain the potential one and can be not realized in plant tissues (Fry, 2004). The aryl-glycoside hydrolysis coupled with the demonstration of final product presence is much more convincing. Thus, steps 10 and 11 were included in the protocol. If for any reason you cannot perform these stages, you may conclude only about the potential activity of arabinofuranosidases.# RecipesNote: The recipes that are given below let to produce the amount of solutions that is sufficient for calibration and four repeating of the experiments with five samples in each replica.1. 5% (w/w) solution of NaOCl Dissolve 25 of NaOCl in 475 ml of water2. 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Dissolve 0.03 of N a N_3 in 99.97ml of water3.  50 mM NaOAc buffer (p H6.0) with 3m M of dithiothreitol on 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Dissolve 0.205 g of NaOAc and 0.0231 g of DL-dithiothreitol in 40 mI of 0.03% (w/w) NaN3Adjust the pH to 6.0 by the adding of glacial acetic acid Adjust the volume to 50 ml by the adding of 0.03% (w/w) NaN34.  10 mM 4NPA Dissolve 0.0027 g of 4NPA in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Adjust the volume of solution to 1~ml by additional 0.03% (w/w) NaN35.  1 M N a_2C O_3 Dissolve 2.12 g of N a_2C O_3 in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 Adjust the volume of solution to _20ml by additional 0.03% (w/w) NaN36.

(2007) and Noir et al. (2013). Flow cytometry experiments were repeated at least three times for each genotype using independent biological replicates.Arabidopsis protoplasts isolation and imagingFor cell wall digestion 3 mL of PCV (packed cell volume) was used for 0, 2, 4 and 6 days after sub-culturing (DASU). Protoplasts were isolated as previously described (Mathur et al., 1995) and counted using a haemocytometer (Fuchs-Rosenthal). The protoplasts were imaged using a Nikon NiE Upright microscope, and cell number and cell volume were analysed with ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).Proteolytic digestion and identification of peptides by nano-liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometryExtraction of apoplastic washing fluid (AWF) and in-gel trypsin digestion of polypeptides for mass spectrometry was performed according to O’Brien et al. (2012). Mass spectrometry was performed on a hybrid linear ion-trap orbitrap instrument (Orbitrap XL, Thermo Scientific) using a high-resolution precursor measurement (filtered at <10 ppm) and low-resolution product ion spectra on the ion-trap. Peptide identifications were made using Mascot software (Matrix Sciences).Analysis of polar metabolites by GC-MSFour independent biological replicates for wild type and COV samples either untreated, mock treated (ethanol vehicle) or 50 μm MeJA treated (24 samples in total) were analysed. Samples for metabolite analysis by GC-MS were prepared according to Gullberg et al. (2004). Metabolomic analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph equipped with a Hewlett Packard 7673 Autosampler and a 25 × 0.22 mm id DB5 column with 0.25 μm film, interfaced to a Hewlett Packard 5970 mass sensitive detector (Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK). GC-MS analysis was carried out according to O’Brien et al. (2012). The data were analysed with Chemstation software (Agilent) and mass spectra were extracted using AMDIS 32 v.2.72 (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System, http://amdis.net/index.html) and submitted to the NIST 2014 (National Institute of Science and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA; http://www.nist.gov/index.html) and Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) (Hummel et al., 2010) mass spectra libraries. Only the features confirmed with both databases were selected.Data analysisIndividual chromatogram peak areas above threshold (peak area >7000 TIC units) expressed as ratios to the total peak areas were processed. Relative metabolite abundances were tested for statistical significance using R (R Development Core Team, 2011). The multiple comparison method was a Tukey HSD test, following a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; the response variable was metabolite abundance and the model was treatment × cells). For all experiments described, at least three independent biological replicates were tested, unless otherwise stated. The s.e. is shown as ± of the mean. All graphs, tables and volcano plots were produced using Microsoft Office Excel 2010.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6324744.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Pea Aphid Survival Assays on Arabidopsis thaliana","text":"Pea Aphid Survival Assays on Arabidopsis thaliana\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  3 to 4-week-old Vicia faba plants grown in 14~h light (18^°C)/10h dark (15^°C) 2.  7-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in a short day condition (10 h light/14 h dark (22^°C) ) 3.

Obtaining a cohort of aged pea aphids1.  Collect adult pea aphids in a petri dish from a stock cage (Note 2).2.  Use a moist paintbrush to transfer the aphids to a fresh cage containing several Vicia faba plants in pots.3.  Place the cage, containing the aphids and plants, in long day growth conditions 14 h light (22^°C) , 10h night (15^°C) .4.  After ^24h remove all the adult aphids, while the nymphs remain (Note 3).5.  Allow the nymphs to reach the adult stage (Note 4).B.  Setting up the experiment1.  Use plastic plant labels to label 7-week-old Arabidopsis with their genotype and the plant number (e.g. Col-0, plant 1). Use at least five plants per genotype per replicate.2.  Collect the cohort of aged pea aphids in a petri dish.3.  Use a moist paintbrush to transfer 5 of the aphids to a clip cage.4.  Gently clip the cage onto a fully developed leaf of the Arabidopsis plant.5.  Repeat the previous two steps until all the plants have one clip cage each.6.  Randomize the plants across the area that they are to be grown in (Note 5).7.  Place the plants in short day conditions 8 h light (18^°C) , 16h night (16^°C) .C.  Collecting the results1.  The day that the aphids are caged to the Arabidopsis plants is day 0.2.  Count and record the number of live adults in the clip cages on days 2 to 7.Table 1. Example data from one repeat of an experiment with Col-0 Arabidopsis, with readings taken on days 3 to 7()D.  Repetition1.  Repeat the whole experiment (steps 1-3) on at least 3 separate occasions.# E.  Analysing the results1.  Calculate the time point at which survival on wild type Arabidopsis is 50% (Note 6). If this occurs between two of the days (e.g. between day 3 and 4) then average the number of adults alive on these two days.2.  Use this time point to calculate the number of adults alive on each plant (Note 7).3.  Analyze by classical linear regression analysis using a Poisson distribution within a generalized linear model.# Notes1.  The cage should be large enough for the Vicia faba plants to grow, and allow sufficient light and ventilation while preventing the aphids from escaping. We use Perspex cages (47 cm high ×54 cm deep x 24 cm wide) with a fine mesh covering attached by magnetic strips at one end to serve as a door.2.  5 to 10 pea aphids per Arabidopsis plant in the experiment should be sufficient, as approximately one nymph is born per adult in 24h at 22^°C . The aphids reproduce slower at lower temperatures and therefore more adults are needed to produce the same number of nymphs.3.  Make sure to count the number of adults added to the cage, and remove the same number of adults at this stage.4.  In the conditions stated, pea aphids should reach the adult stage by 8 or 9 days, having undergone four moults. Only adult aphids reproduce. It is recommended to use aphids 10 to 14 days old.5.  For example, if you are placing the experimental plants in 3 trays for the experiment then randomly assign each plant a number of 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to trays 1, 2 and 3. This can be done using the RANDBETWEEN function in Microsoft® Excel.6.  Average the number of adult pea aphids alive on each day across all your repeats of the wild type Arabidopsis. Then plot this data against the experiment day number on a line graph. See Reference 1 (Prince et al., 2014) Figure 6B for an example.7.  For example, the data in Table 1 is part of a larger data set where 50% survival is between day 3 and 4. Therefore, the data would be calculated as: Plant 1=4 , Plant  z= 3.5, Plant 3=3.5 , Plant 4=3 , Plant 5=4 .# AcknowledgementsWe thank Andrew Davis for the photograph of the clip cage.

Alcohol as absolute ethanol from Pharmaco-AAper, Bristol, PA and cocaine from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. The primers used for genotyping and RNAscope insitu hybridization are provided in (Supplementary Table S3).Drug treatment protocolCannabinoid ligands, the mixed CB1R and CB2R agonist, WIN55212-2, and the selective CB2R agonist JWH 133 were made up in tween 80: DMSO: Saline in a ratio of 1:2:7. The vehicle was the same ratio 1:2:7, of tween 80: DMSO: Saline. ACEA, the CB1R selective agonist was purchased already made up in Tocrisolve-100 and made up to the selected dose using the vehicle. The doses of cannabinoids ligands, alcohol 8–16% and cocaine (5 mg/kg) dissolved in normal saline were based on our previous research6,16. The route of administration of the drugs were dependent on the behavioral test, with alcohol consumption in the stress models and injection in the conditioned place preference paradigm as described below. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally (IP) in a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.Generation of CB2flox/flox experimental animalsIn collaboration with inGenious Targeting Laboratory (iTL, Ronkonkoma NY) the Cre-LoxP constructs were designed and the CB2flox/flox mice generated at iTL and breeding pairs shipped to our animal laboratory facility at William Paterson University. The strategy used to create the CB2flox/flox mice involved microinjection of targeted iTL BA1 (129 Sv x C57BL/6) hybrid embryonic cells into CB57BL/6) blastocysts. The resulting chimeras with high percentage agouti coat color were mated to C57BL/6 FLP mice to remove the Neo cassette. The coding exon of Cnr2 are flanked by left LoxP at 5′-splicing site and right LoxP at downstream of the stop codon so that Cre- recombination produced the cell-type specific deletion of entire coding region and splicing site. The CB2flox/flox mice were bred and crossed with DAT-Cre mice to produce DAT-Cnr2-LoxP transgenic mice – making this the first reported cell-type selected deletion of CB2Rs in dopamine neurons. Animals were housed in temperature and humidity controlled animal laboratory with water and food available ad libitum. Experiments were performed using adult mice 20–30 g body weight with N = 10 ± 2 mice each for the different experimental groups for the behavioral analysis. The experimental procedures followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by William Paterson University animal care and use committee.RNAscope In Situ Hybridization (ISH)RNAscope ISH was performed as previously described5,18. RNAscope in situ hybridization of mouse spleen section was first performed to demonstrate CB2 probe specificity, green color represents CB2R mRNA, TH and DAT red, and DAPI blue and color joined using iVision software46. The animals (DAT−/− Cnr2 −/−, DAT+/– Cnr2 −/−, DAT+/+- Cnr2 +/+; 3 mice aged 2–3 months of each genotype) were anesthetized, perfused with saline solution to wash out blood cells in the brain. The mice were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and postfixed with the same 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C. The brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M ophosphate buffer overnight, after which the brains were wrapped in labeled aluminum foil for storage at −80 °C for RNAscope ISH. Briefly, 12 µm coronal brain sections were cut and the fixation, protease pretreatment, probe hybridization, preamplification and fluorescent labeling steps were carried out according to the user manual. Wide-field fluorescent images of the ventral tegmental area was captured using a QimagingExi Aqua Camera (Biovision) attached to a Zeiss AXIO Imager M2 microscope using a × 40 objective (Zeiss PLAN-APOCHROMAT, NA = 1.3) with oil immersion. Images were deconvoluted with Huygens software (v3.7, Scientific Volume Imaging). Image Processing and Analysis by Java (ImageJ, NIH) software was used to quantify mRNA signals in the sections.ImmunohistochemistryStressed and non-stressed DAT-Cnr2 cKO and wild type mice were prepared for immunohistochemical procedures as previously described56 and were optimized for tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining for dopaminergic neurons at the level of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine solution and perfused intracardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4.0% paraformaldehyde (PF) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.1. Brains are removed, post-fixed in the same fixative solution overnight and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 4% PF in PB and then frozen. Serial coronal cryostat sections of the brainstem containing the SN and VTA areas were cut at 30 µm. The sections were processed free floating in blocking buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in PB) for 1.0 hr at room temperature, and then sections were incubated with the primary antibody rabbit anti-TH (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 1: 750 for 48 hours at 4 °C. Sections were washed to remove the primary antibody and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1.5 hr at room temperature. Sections were rinsed, mounted onto slides and cover slipped. The sections were analyzed under an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a camera connected to a PC. The images were acquired with Cell-F software.Behavioral analysisThe successful creation and production of mice with cell specific deletion of CB2Rs in dopamine neurons allowed us to analyze and characterize the DAT-Cnr2 cKO mice in models of CNS function. For motor function tests of general activity, we used the open field and wheel running tests. For mouse models of emotionality tests we used tail suspension (TST) and forced swim test (FST) to evaluate depression-like behavior while the elevated plus maze and two-chamber light/dark box were used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior. The role that CB2Rs in dopamine neurons play in alcohol preference and cocaine reward using the conditioned place preference following sub-acute and chronic mild stress(CMS) was determined. Anhedonia was evluated weekly using the sucrose preference test. The tail flick and hotplate tests were used to measure the thermo-nociceptive responses. The availability of these mice is an excellent opportunity to reveal whether or not CB2Rs are involved the characteristic cannabinoid induced profile in the “tetrad” test. Animals were allowed to habituate in the test area for at least 30 min before each test. The specific experimental protocols to characterize the involvement of CB2Rs in dopamine neurons in behavioral studies are described below.Motor function testsThe open field test was used to assess the general activity, including ambulatory, stereotypic, rearing and jump counts of the DAT-Cnr2 cKO mice and wild type controls. For this test animals were placed in individual test boxes connected to a computer for 10 mins and activity counts were obtained and analyzed. Open field test is useful for the assessment of general motor function tests, as repeated exposure to the test provides a method for assessing habituation to the increasingly familiar chamber enviroment. To test if habituation developed, the wild type and DAT-Cnr2 cKO mice were allowed to freely explore the open field chambers for 10 mins for three consective days at the same time. The activities were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Wheel running activity of the animals were monitored by the placement of each mouse in the spontaneous wheel running monitor. The wheel running behavior of the animals were monitored by auto-counters which monitor the total number of revolutions over the 10 mins test session for each animal.Emotionality testsForced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used to evaluate depression-like while anxiety-like behaviors were assesed using the elevated plus-maze and the two compartment black/white box as we previously utilized57 and validated58. These tests were used because they have differing sensitivities for predicting depression-like and anxiety-like profiles in the mouse models described below:Forced swim and tail suspension testsFor the FST, mice were first conditioned to water-filled glass cylinders for 20 mins the day prior to testing. The glass cylinder is (16 cm diameter and height 35 cm) filled to a depth 15 cm with water (23–25 °C). One glass cylinder was used for each mouse and we tested six mice at a time using six glass cylinders. In this study a two-day swim test procedure was utilized first to access the basal performance of the different mouse strains. On the first day mice were placed in the glass cylinder with water to the specified depth, and all animals were exposed for 20-min pre-swim test prior to the 5-min forced swim test on day 2. Fresh water was introduced prior to each test. The data recorded during the 5-min test session were the times the animals were immobile and also the number of immobility counts during the test session. The immobility time and counts were retrieved from the recorded test sessions. Similar data was obtained for the vehicle treated control animals. During the test session the duration of immobility was defined by the animal’s stationary position, and only made the minimal movements necessary to keep their head above water.The tail suspension test (TST) was used to evaluate depression-like behavior in the mice. Each mouse was suspended by the tail so that the body dangles in the air, facing downward from a metal bar elevated 30 cm. The behavioral profile in this test was videotaped for 6 min and immobility times during the tail suspension was scored using stopwatch from the videotape and analyzed. The tail suspension test was performed as previously described59.Two compartment black/white box and elevated plus maze testAn insert with black and white compartment and inter-connecting opening was inserted into each of the locomotor activity boxes (a total of 5 boxes and 5 inserts) and used to measure anxiety-like behavior in the test subjects. Animals were habituated to the test environment before placement individually into the center of the white area and their behavior and movement was recorded with the computer interphase. The time spent and number of entries into the compartments were retrieved and analyzed for DAT-Cn2 and wild type mice. The elevated plus maze (EPM) was used as a screening test for anxiety-like behavior and data was compared to that obtained from the black/white box. The EPM test setting consisted of a plus-shaped arena with two open and closed arms, each with an open roof, elevated 60 cm from the floor. The test was initiated by placing each mouse on the central platform of the maze, facing one of the open arms, and letting it move freely. Each session lasted for 5 min. Six mice per group were used and their respective times spent in the open and closed arms, as well as the number of entries into the arms, were recorded. The maze was cleaned with alcohol between tests. This procedure is similar to that previously used for the pharmacological characterization of cannabinoids in the plus maze60.Thermo-nociceptive testsHot plate and tail-flick tests were used to evaluate the responsiveness to thermal stimulus. Pain responses from these tests constitute part of the characteristic profile of cannabinoid effects in the tetrad tests described below and after the administration of cannabinoids. For the hotplate test, animals were gently dropped into a box with a metal floor that was pre-heated to 55 ± 2 °C. The latency to responses such as jumping, licking a hind paw or flinching one of the paws is taken as a nociceptive response. To prevent tissue damage, a cut off time was set to 90 sec. The tail-flick was included to assess the latency of the avoidance to thermal stimulus in the mice and also after the administration of cannabinoids in the tetrad tests. In this test radiant heat was applied to about 4 cm from the tip tail length using a tail flick apparatus (UGO Basil). Tail-flick latency time was measured as the time from the onset of the heat exposure to the time of withdrawal of the tail, when the animal feels discomfort, and reacts by a sudden tail movement – the tail-flick response. A cut-off point of 15 s for the discontinuation of the heat stimulus was used to avoid tissue damage. For each mouse tested, baseline latency was obtained as the mean of three measurements.Tetrad testsThe characteristic profile of suppression of spontaneous locomotor activity, anti-nociception, hypothermia and catalepsy which are referred to as the tetrad tests, has been associated with the effects of classical cannabinoids and postulated to be mediated by CB1R agonism. We hypothesized that CB2Rs are involved in the tetrad test. To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the performances of the DAT-Cnr2 cKO and the wild type mice in the tetrad tests, and then determined the effects of selected cannabinoids in these animals in the tetrad tests. Briefly, the mouse tetrad tests consist of four simple evaluations, which were measured in sequence as we previously described61. On the test day, DAT-Cnr2 cKO and wild type control mice (N = 10 ± 2 animals per group) were evaluated in the tetrad test by the measurement of: 1) activities in the locomotor activity boxes for 10 min, 2) catalepsy, amount of time in 5 mins that the animal remains immobile in the ring test, 3) rectal temperature and 4) nociception, measured by the hot plate and tail flick response. The experiment was repeated following intraperitoneal (i.p) administration of selected doses of the mixed CB1R and CB2R WIN 55212-2 (3.0 mg/kg), CB1R agonist (ACEA (1.0 mg/kg) and CB2R agonist JWH 133 (20.0 mg/kg).Alcohol preference testAll tests of preference were conducted in individually housed DAT-Cnr2 cKO and the wild type mice (N = 12 mice per group) with two fluid bottles available to the animals, for a 24 h period. To establish a baseline of consumption both bottles were filled with 150 ml of water and weighed with the tops and placed over the cages for three days. For the preference measurement one bottle was replaced with 16% alcohol. The bottles were weighed for each animal for five consecutive days at 10 am. The positions of the bottles in the different cages were randomized with respect to which side of the cages they were placed. In all experiments, the ratio of alcohol to water consumed, and the total fluid consumption, were calculated to obtain a preference ratio. Half of the animals in each group (N = 6) were stressed by putting them in a 50 mL tube for an hour each day for 5 consecutive days. Alcohol preference ratio was determined by dividing the amount of alcohol consumed by total fluid (alcohol + water) consumed with and without the sub-acute stress.Conditioned place preferenceAlcohol and cocaine CPP training and testing were conducted using an infrared photobeam detector open field apparatus (ENV-510) from Med Associates (St. Albans, VT, USA) equipped with the two-compartment place preference inserts (ENV-512). The floor for chamber-1 has parallel rods (3-mm radius, 8 mm center to center spacing) with black cardboard paper covering the outside. Chamber-2 has a stainless steel wire mesh (6 × 6) floor with white cardboard paper covering the outside of the walls. Each compartment is 13 cm (width) × 24 cm (length) × 15 cm (depth). An Activity Monitor software (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) was used for automated data collection. All conditioning sessions and preference tests were performed between 10 am and 1 pm., with each group of DAT-Cnr2 cKO and control mice tested at the same time every day. For each group the experiment took place over a period of 8 days split into three phases (pre-conditioning, conditioning and post-conditioning). Each phase is separated by one day. In the pre-conditioning phase, before the first conditioning session, mice were placed in the room with the CPP apparatus for approximately 45 minutes for them to habituate. After habituation, subjects were placed in CPP box and allowed 15 minutes of unrestricted access between sides, the time spent in each of the compartments was recorded using Activity Monitor®. During the conditioning phase animals were injected with saline by their weight and confined to compartment 2 of the CPP apparatus for 15 minutes. Four hours after the first session, mice designated as control received ip vehicle injections once more and placed in compartment 1 for 15 minutes. The other half of the animals received alcohol or cocaine by their weight and also confined to compartment 1 for 15 minutes. This was repeated for 4 consecutive days. At the end of each session, mice were immediately removed from the CPP compartments and returned to their home cages. On the test session (day 8), or post-conditioning phase, mice were allowed to freely explore both sides of the CPP compartments for 15 minutes (identical to day 1). The activity monitor recorded time spent in each of the compartments. The time which each mouse spent in the compartments was recorded and the CPP score was defined as the time spent in the drug paired compartment minus the time spent in the saline-paired compartment during the CPP test.Chronic mild stress and anhedonia testTwo groups of DAT-Cnr2 cKO and WT mice (N = 6 per group) were subjected to CMS for a period of 7 weeks. The other two separate groups of DAT-Cnr2 cKO and WT mice (N = 6 per group) were the experimental control groups that were housed in a separate holding room and were not subjected to CMS. All animals were housed individually in their cages for the duration of the study. The CMS procedure was performed according to the method we used previously62, with some modification. Briefly, mice were subjected to various stressors according to a semi-random schedule for 7 consecutive weeks. The stress regime for each week consisted of food deprivation for 12 h, water deprivation for 12 h, damp bedding for 12 h, overnight stroboscopic illumination, tail suspension for 10 min, tube restrained stress for 30 min, loud music overnight, wire mesh to replace bedding, 30 min introduction of an intruder mouse to the cage and lights off or on. These stressors were paired morning or overnight. All non-stressed groups were given food and water at all times, as well as comfortable cage surroundings, while the experimental group was housed in a different room. Once every week sucrose (2%) consumption was measured as a test of anhedonia in the CMS and non-stressed animals. At the end of the stress regime, alcohol consumption was measured in all groups of the CMS and non-stressed, similar to the anhedonia test regimen.Sucrose consumption testSucrose intake (2% sucrose solution) was measured once every week and consumption of sucrose solution was estimated simultaneously in the control and experimental groups by comparing bottle weights before and after the anhedonia test. The volume of sucrose consumed was obtained by the difference before and after the anhedonia test and also by weighing the bottles with the sucrose before and after the anhedonia tests. No difference between the two methods were noted when considering inadvertent spills. The intake was used as the measure of anhedonia – a lack of pleasure validated for the CMS model63.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis were performed with Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). The number of studied in each of the behavioral tests was 10 ± 2. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by Mann-Whitney test of Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test followed by Dunn’s post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. For the CPP test, data was converted to an initial preference score for each mouse by subtracting the time spent in the drug-paired compartment on day 1 (pre-conditioning phase) from time spent in the same chamber on the last day (post-conditioning phase). Positive scores indicate the development of preference. Behavioral data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Other behavioral analysis were analyzed by the student t- test and a *P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Availability of materials and dataThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request64–69.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5727179.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Inoculation of Rice with Different Pathogens: Sheath Blight (Rhizoctonia solani), Damping off Disease (Pythium graminicola) and Barley Powdery Mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) Rhoda Delventhal, Marco Loehrer, Denise Weidenbach and Ulrich Schaffrath*","text":"Inoculation of Rice with Different Pathogens: Sheath Blight (Rhizoctonia solani), Damping off Disease (Pythium graminicola) and Barley Powdery Mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) Rhoda Delventhal, Marco Loehrer, Denise Weidenbach and Ulrich Schaffrath*\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Cultivate P. graminicola on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22~^°C in the dark. For maintenance, transfer agar blocks (ca. 0.5×0.5cm ) overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks. For inoculation, use P. graminicola cultures seven days after subcultivation (Figure 2A).2.  Prepare square Petri dishes ( 12×12c m) with 1.5% agar in Gamborg B5 medium.3.  Fill rice seeds in a 50ml tube and add 4% sodium hypochlorite for surface-sterilization, shake for 10m i n . Subsequently, wash three times with sterile distilled water.4.  Place 3-6 seeds in a line on one Gamborg B5 agar-plate.5.  Seal the plates with 3M micropore tape and protect root growth from light by covering with aluminum foil.6.  Incubate the plates upright in a plant growth chamber (conditions see above) until roots have grown to a length of ca. 1 cm (after approx. 5 days).7.  For inoculation, cut small agar blocks (ca. 0.5×0.5c m ) from the marginal zone of a 7 days old P. graminicola culture. Place one agar block between the roots of adjacent plants (Figure 2B). Incubate the plates in a growth chamber as before.8.  Monitor the disease development for 1 to 2 weeks after inoculation.C.  Inoculation protocol for Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh)()Figure 3. Images of Bgh inoculation. A. Two-week old rice plants with second leaves fixed on a tray. B. Barley plants heavily infected with Bgh (with white powdery mildew pustules on primary leaves). C. Example for a settling tower that was used for Bgh inoculation (plants were fixed on a tray which was placed at the bottom of the tower). At the top an opening is visible through which infected barley plants can be introduced into the tower.1.  As the fungus is an obligate biotroph, maintainance has to be done on barley plants in a growth cabinet separated from the test plants. Weekly transfer of Bgh onto fresh, one-week old plants is done by shaking off conidiospores from heavily infected barley plants (Figure 3B).2.  Grow rice plants in soil for approx. 2 weeks until full expansion of the second leaf. Use squared plant pots in order to facilitate a stable fixation on the inoculation trays (see step C4).3.  One day before inoculation, remove old Bgh conidiospores from barley plants by shaking (Note 2).4.  For the inoculation of rice, place the plant pots laterally on a tray and fix the second leaf of each plant, adaxial surface up, on the tray by placing 2-3mm stripes of removable adhesive labels at the tip and the base of each leaf(Note 3, Figure 3A).5.  Place a Thoma cell counting chamber (without cover glass) beside or between the fixed leaves to monitor the inoculation density.6.  Cover the trays with a settling tower (Figure 3C).7.  For inoculation, gently transfer leaves or whole plant pots of Bgh-infected barley plants to the opening of the settling tower and release freshly emerged conidiospores into the tower by shaking. Subsequently, wave with a small tray in the air space of the settling tower to cause a turbulent flow and evenly dispense the conidia.8.  Let the conidiospores settle for 30-60 min.9.  Apply a cover glass to the Thoma counting cell and determine the spore density by microscopy. Therefore count the conidiospores in the large central square of each of the two chambers (1 m m^2 in a standard Thoma chamber) and take the average. Under our laboratory conditions, 1-5 spores m m^-2 may result in distinct, macroscopically observable mildew pustules, while approx.15-20 spores m m^-2 are recommended for microscopic evaluation. If spore density is too low, return to step C5.10. Gently remove the adhesive labels from the rice leaves, raise the pots and transfer them to the plant growth chamber.11. On host plants, first powdery mildew pustules (as shown in Figure 3B) can be observed within the first week after inoculation. Since rice is a nonhost plant for Bgh, evaluation of the infection process has to be done by microscopy.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Inoculation Protocol for Rhizoctonia solani\n## Cultivation of R. solani\nCultivate R. solani on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22°C in the dark.\nFor maintenance, transfer agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks.\nFor inoculation, use a R. solani culture seven days after sub-cultivation.\n## Preparation of Rice Plants\nGrow rice plants for approximately 4 weeks until full expansion of the fourth leaf.\nCut off the upper 10 cm of the fourth leaves of different rice plants and immediately place them on moist filter paper.\n## Inoculation\nCut small agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium from a 7-day old R. solani culture.\nPlace one agar block in the middle of each rice leaf.\n## Incubation and Observation\nIncubate the Petri dishes with the inoculated leaves in the plant chamber.\nAvoid desiccation of the leaves by daily moistening the filter paper with distilled water.\nObserve the development of necrotic lesions within four days after inoculation.\n## Inoculation Protocol for Pythium graminicola\n## Cultivation of P. graminicola\nCultivate P. graminicola on potato extract glucose agar (PDA) at 22°C in the dark.\nFor maintenance, transfer agar blocks overgrown with fungal mycelium to fresh PDA plates every two weeks.\nFor inoculation, use P. graminicola cultures seven days after subcultivation.\n## Preparation of Rice Seeds\nFill rice seeds in a 50ml tube and add 4% sodium hypochlorite for surface-sterilization.\nWash three times with sterile distilled water.\nPlace 3-6 seeds in a line on one Gamborg B5 agar-plate.\n## Inoculation\nCut small agar blocks from the marginal zone of a 7-day old P. graminicola culture.\nPlace one agar block between the roots of adjacent plants.\n## Incubation and Observation\nIncubate the plates in a growth chamber.\nMonitor the disease development for 1 to 2 weeks after inoculation.\n## Inoculation Protocol for Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh)\n## Maintenance of Bgh\nMaintain Bgh on barley plants in a growth cabinet separated from the test plants.\nWeekly transfer of Bgh onto fresh, one-week old plants is done by shaking off conidiospores from heavily infected barley plants.\n## Preparation of Rice Plants\nGrow rice plants in soil for approximately 2 weeks until full expansion of the second leaf.\nUse squared plant pots to facilitate a stable fixation on the inoculation trays.\n## Inoculation\nRemove old Bgh conidiospores from barley plants by shaking.\nFix the second leaf of each plant, adaxial surface up, on the tray by placing 2-3mm stripes of removable adhesive labels at the tip and the base of each leaf.\nCover the trays with a settling tower.\nGently transfer leaves or whole plant pots of Bgh-infected barley plants to the opening of the settling tower and release freshly emerged conidiospores into the tower by shaking.\n## Incubation and Observation\nLet the conidiospores settle for 30-60 min.\nApply a cover glass to the Thoma counting cell and determine the spore density by microscopy.\nGently remove the adhesive labels from the rice leaves, raise the pots and transfer them to the plant growth chamber.\nOn host plants, first powdery mildew pustules can be observed within the first week after inoculation.","keywords":" Rice, Inoculation protocols, Fungal plant pathogens, Oomycete, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium graminicola, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, Nonhost resistance","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2070"}}

T3SA+ and T3SA- encode σ1 with primary amino acid sequence of the strain T3C44-MA and T3SA- encodes an additional point mutation (P204L) in σ1 that renders it deficient in sialic acid binding [22]. All three reovirus strains were prepared from laboratory stocks by plaque purification followed by 3–4 passages in L929 cells. Virions were purified from infected L929 cell lysates using a cesium chloride gradient as described [108, 109]. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay using L929 cells and expressed as plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) [110]. Particle concentration was determined from the optical density of purified virions at 260 nm using the relationship, 1 OD260 = 2.1×1012 particles/ml [111]. ISVPs were prepared by treatment of reovirus virions with α-chymotrypsin (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 60 min [56].Reovirus particles were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 TFP ester or Alexa Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) to generate fluorescent virions [69]. For labeling, reovirus particles were diluted to 6×1012 particles/ml in freshly prepared 50 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer and incubated with 20 μM dye at room temperature for 90 min, protected from light. Labeled virions were dialyzed at 4°C overnight against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), exchanging the buffer 2–3 times to remove unreacted dye.Ethics statementAll animal work was conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service policy and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #17101553). All personnel adhered to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional laws and policies governing ethical animal research. This includes the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy, the Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research and Training, and the Health Research Extension Act of 1985.Isolation and culture of primary neuronsPrimary neuron cultures were established from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos, E17.5 for CNs and E14.5 for DRGNs. Timed pregnant rats were obtained from Charles Rivers and housed at the University of Pittsburgh facilities until euthanasia by thoracotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Fetuses were decapitated and stored on ice in Hank’s balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium (HBSS; Corning) while isolating required tissues.CNs: Cortices were isolated from decapitated fetuses and processed to culture CNs as described [21]. Dishes to culture CNs were coated at 4°C overnight with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, P0899) and 1 μg/ml laminin (Corning, 354232) diluted in Neurobasal medium (Gibco, 21103049). CNs were plated at a density of 2×105 viable cells either per dish on the depressed, glass-covered area of 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, P35G-1.5-14-C) or per well in 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, 82050–892). Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented to contain 1x B-27 (Gibco, 17504044), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.6 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050079). One-half of the culture medium was changed every 3–4 days for 8–14 days before experimental manipulations.DRGNs: Glass bottom MatTek dishes used to culture DRGNs were plasma-treated (Harrick plasma cleaner, PDC-32G) to improve hydrophilicity of culture surfaces. This treatment was essential to retain adhesion of DRGNs to dishes longer than 5 days in culture. All dishes to culture DRGNs were coated sequentially with 0.5 mg/ml poly-D-lysine hydrobromide and 26 μg/ml laminin at 37°C for 4–16 h.To isolate DRGs, internal organs were removed from decapitated fetuses, and the spinal cord with attached DRGs was resected from the spinal column. DRGs were isolated and stored in Hibernate-E medium (Gibco, A1247601) up to 10 days before dissociation for culture. Papain (20 units/ml, Worthington) was activated by incubation at 37°C for 20 min in HBSS containing 5.5 mM L-cysteine and 0.2 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate. DRGs were washed with HBSS and treated with the activated papain solution at 37°C for 17 min, followed by incubation in HBSS containing 1 mg/ml ovomucoid protease inhibitor (Worthington, LK003182), 1250 units/ml DNase I (Sigma, D5025), and 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche, 10103578001) at 37°C for 10 min. DRGs were washed twice with HBSS and dissociated mechanically by triturating with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Viable cells were plated at a density of 5–10×104 cells per dish on 35 mm glass bottom MatTek dishes.DRGN cultures were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Neurobasal and UltraCULTURE serum-free (Lonza, BE12-725F) media supplemented to contain 1x N-2 (Gibco, 17502048), 1x B-27, 3% Hyclone FBS (GE Healthcare, SH30088.03), 2 mM GlutaMAX, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 20–50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Gibco, 13257019). The day after plating, cultures were treated with 2 μM Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, C1768) in complete medium for 48 h to inhibit proliferation of non-neuronal cells in culture. One-half of the culture medium was changed every 3–4 days thereafter for 8–14 days before experimental manipulations.DRGN culture in microfluidic devices: Microfluidic devices with 450 μm long microgrooves preassembled on optically transparent plastic (Xona microfluidics, XC450) were sterilized with 90% ethanol according to manufacturer’s instructions. Devices were subsequently coated sequentially with 0.5 mg/ml poly-D-lysine hydrobromide and 26 μg/ml laminin at 37°C for 4–16 h. Dissociated DRGs, 1–3×105 viable cells, were plated in one compartment of a microfluidic device, designated as the “somal compartment.” To promote extension of axons into the opposing “axonal compartment,” a gradient of NGF was introduced by adding medium containing 20 ng/ml NGF in the somal compartment and 50 ng/ml NGF in the axonal compartment. Neurons were cultivated for 8 days to allow axon penetration into the microgrooves and development of axonal network in the opposing compartment before use in experiments.AntibodiesPrimary antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence to stain specific structures include: guinea pig anti-σNS for reovirus inclusions [112], T1L core-specific rabbit antiserum for reovirus cores [113], mouse anti-TUJ1 (BioLegend, 801201) for neurons, chicken anti-MAP2 (Abcam, ab92434) for dendrites, and mouse anti-non-phosphorylated neurofilament H (Millipore Sigma, SMI-32) for axons. Equal volumes of sera from rabbits immunized and boosted with T1L or T3D reovirus strains were mixed [114], adsorbed on rat CN culture to deplete non-specific antibodies, and used to stain reovirus-infected cells. Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualization of antigens by indirect immunofluorescence. Anti-core serum was used at a 1:250 dilution and all other antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution.Indirect immunofluorescence stainingCells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 37°C for 20 min. Fixative was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were incubated sequentially with primary and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-BGT (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% glycine, and 0.05% TWEEN 20) at room temperature for 45–60 min and washed three times with PBS-BGT after each incubation. For staining under non-permeabilizing conditions, the same protocol was followed excluding triton X-100 and TWEEN 20 from buffers.Treatment with chemical inhibitorsSmall molecule inhibitors were reconstituted and stored according to manufacturer’s instructions and used as listed in Table 1.10.1371/journal.ppat.1008380.t001Table 1Treatment of neurons with small molecule inhibitors.Small MoleculeSource,Catalog NumberFinal ConcentrationDuration of Pre-treatmentCiliobrevin ASigma-Aldrich, 25040150 μM1 hCycloheximideSigma-Aldrich, C769850 μg/ml1 hDynasoreAbcam, ab120192150 μM1 hE64Sigma-Aldrich, E3132200 μM4 h5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride or EIPASigma-Aldrich, A308525 μM1 hGenisteinSigma-Aldrich, G6649200 μM1 hJasplakinolideSigma-Aldrich, J45800.5 μM20 minNocodazoleSigma-Aldrich, M140430 μM1 hPitStop2Abcam, ab12068725 μM30 minWortmanninCayman Chemicals, 10010591200 nM1 hList of small molecule inhibitors used in this study along with their sources, final concentrations of use, and durations of pre-treatment of cells.To study the effects of small molecule inhibitors on reovirus entry, transport, or infectivity, CNs or DRGNs were pre-treated with small molecule inhibitors at 37°C for the indicated time intervals. Pre-treatments were carried out with Ciliobrevin A or PitStop2 diluted in HBSS containing calcium and magnesium and all other drugs diluted in complete culture medium and followed by inoculation with reovirus suspended in culture medium containing drugs.Reovirus infection, imaging, and quantificationIn experiments comparing effects of small molecule inhibitors on reovirus infectivity, CNs in culture were pre-treated as described above with small molecule inhibitors or a corresponding vehicle control, and then inoculated with T3SA+ virions or ISVPs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50,000 particles per cell in the presence of inhibitors in Neurobasal medium. In experiments comparing infectivity of reovirus serotypes, CNs or DRGNs in culture were inoculated with reovirus at an MOI of 500 or 50 PFU/cell, respectively, in Neurobasal medium.Following incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated in complete culture medium (containing inhibitors, where relevant) at 37°C for 24 h before fixing and immunofluorescence staining. For each condition, 9–16 fields-of-view from duplicate samples were imaged using the LionHeart FX imager. Neurons were identified by TUJ1 or MAP2 staining and infected neurons that were stained by reovirus antiserum were enumerated manually. Infectivity was normalized to controls (not treated with drugs) included in each experiment to account for variations between neuron preparations and number of days in culture.To infect DRGNs in microfluidic devices, culture medium in either the somal or axonal compartment was replaced with 150 μl inoculum containing T3SA+ virions at an MOI of 500 PFU/cell diluted in complete medium. Fluidic isolation of the inoculum (i.e., restriction of active diffusion of inoculum into the opposing compartment) was achieved by maintaining a 150 μl higher volume in the opposing compartment at all steps. Cells were incubated with reovirus at 37°C for 1 h, washed twice with HBSS, and returned to complete medium. Devices were incubated at 37°C and media from both compartments were collected at 24 h intervals and replaced with fresh medium. Cells were fixed at 72 h post-inoculation and neurons and reovirus antigens were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Viral titers in collected supernatants were determined by plaque assay.Live confocal microscopy of reovirus transportNeurons plated on glass bottom dishes were treated with small molecule inhibitors or vehicle controls and subsequently incubated with 3×1010 (for CNs) or 1×109 (for DRGNs) particles of fluorescently-labeled reovirus diluted in the corresponding complete medium containing inhibitors at 37°C for 30 min. Inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with HBSS, and complete medium containing inhibitors was added. Reovirus transport in neurons was imaged using a Leica TCS-SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber (GSI TOKAI HIT Standard Heating Stage Top Incubator) and a lens heater, which allow maintenance of cells at 37°C for live imaging. Dishes were allowed to equilibrate to 37°C in the heated chamber for 10 min before imaging. Bright field images constructed from PMT signals were used to select random 82 x 82 μm regions uniformly covered with soma and neurites. Time-lapse images of a single optical section of cells (pinhole = 1 AU) were acquired using a 63x objective (NA = 1.4; HC PL APO) and a HyD detector with an optical zoom of 2.25 and a frame interval of 0.26 s. At least 10 fields-of-view spread throughout each dish were imaged with imaging time limited to 30 min per dish.To monitor directional trafficking of reovirus, the axonal compartment of microfluidic devices with DRGN cultures was treated with 3×1010 particles of fluorescently-labeled virions at 37°C for 45 min. Inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with HBSS, and complete medium was added maintaining fluidic isolation of the inoculated chamber. Time-lapse images of reovirus transport through microgrooves, each containing multiple axons, were acquired under live-cell imaging conditions described above. At least 20 grooves were imaged per dish with a 0.26 s interval between frames and imaging time per groove was limited to 60 s.Analysis of reovirus transportNumber of particles trafficking per field: Fiji ImageJ was used to project maximal intensities from time-lapse images of reovirus transport in neurons into a single plane. Trajectories of reovirus particles were identified from the projected images and the number of particles trafficking along each trajectory was manually enumerated from the time-lapse images. Total number of particles trafficking per field under each condition was normalized to corresponding control samples from the same experimental day.Transport kinetics: A custom python script was used to execute the TrackMate (v3.7.0) plugin for Fiji ImageJ for automated tracking of fluorescent reovirus particles in time-lapse images and to obtain corresponding trajectory information. A median filter (3x3 pixels) was applied to all images. Puncta with an initial estimated “blob diameter” of 0.375 pixels (1 pixel = 0.16 μm under imaging setup) were detected using the difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter and puncta with a manually-determined intensity threshold were considered for further analysis. The simple Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) tracker was used to build trajectories with a maximum linking distance of 2.5 μm, and a maximum distance of 3 μm and a frame interval of 3 for gap-closing. Only tracks with displacement greater than 6.5 μm were considered for further analysis.Parameters describing transport dynamics were computed using a custom MATLAB script. Instantaneous velocities were calculated as the displacement of puncta in consecutive ~ 1 s intervals (4 frames). Particles were defined as “in motion” if instantaneous velocities were > 0.15 μm/s and “paused” if < 0.15 μm/s. Pause duration was defined as the cumulative time spent by a punctum in the paused state in consecutive 1 s intervals. Track speed was calculated as the distance traveled by each punctum divided by its tracked duration.Transferrin uptake quantificationTo determine the PitStop2 concentration for efficient inhibition of CME, CNs were treated with a range of concentrations of PitStop2 (0 to 30 μM) diluted in HBSS with calcium and magnesium for 30 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with 25 μg/mL Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin (Invitrogen, T13342) in the presence of PitStop2 at 37°C for 20 min. Cells were then washed twice with stripping buffer (10 mM glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.5) to remove surface-bound transferrin and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Transferrin uptake was quantified under each condition as the integrated fluorescence intensity within a 2.8 x 2.8 μm area of soma. Results were averaged from three experimental repeats, each including duplicate samples, and at least 50 soma from each sample.Quantification of internalized reovirusCNs cultured in glass bottom dishes were treated with small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis or vehicle controls under aforementioned conditions (Table 1). Subsequently, cells were inoculated with 3×1010 particles/dish of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled T3SA+ (red) suspended in complete medium containing inhibitors at 37°C for 40 min. A vehicle-treated sample inoculated at 4°C was used as a control for complete inhibition of endocytosis. Inoculum was removed, and cells were washed twice with HBSS, fixed, and incubated under non-permeabilizing conditions with rabbit anti-reovirus polyclonal serum and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (green) for visualization of extracellular reovirus by indirect immunofluorescence. Single optical sections of at least 10 fields-of-view (82 x 82 μm) uniformly covered with neurites were imaged per dish. Images were processed and analyzed using Fiji ImageJ. Positions of red-fluorescent reovirus puncta (total virus) were identified using the “find maxima” function and the intensity of the green channel (extracellular virus stained by antibody) at the corresponding positions was recorded. Reovirus puncta were categorized as internalized if the green channel intensity was comparable to the background.Analysis of reovirus co-transport with transferrin and dextranAlexa Fluor 647-conjugated transferrin (Invitrogen, T23366) was used to track CME and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated 10,000 MW dextran (Invitrogen, D22914) was used as a marker for fluid-phase uptake during macropinocytosis. To study reovirus co-transport with cargoes taken up by distinct endocytic pathways, CNs were incubated with 3×1010 particles of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled T3SA+ reovirus and fluorescent transferrin or dextran at final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively, in culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, washed twice with HBSS, returned to culture medium, and imaged immediately under live-cell imaging conditions. Multichannel time-lapse images were acquired simultaneously using HyD detectors. Maximal intensity projections of time-lapse images were used to visualize trajectories of transported reovirus particles. Kymographs were generated along individual trajectories using Fiji ImageJ and cotransport of reovirus with transferrin or dextran was determined from the overlap of corresponding fluorescence signals on kymographs.Quantification of reovirus colocalization with acidified vesiclesAxonal compartment of microfluidic devices with DRGNs were treated with 3×1010 particles of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled T3SA+ virions in complete medium while maintaining fluidic isolation at 37°C for 30 min. Inoculum was removed, the axonal compartment was washed twice with HBSS, and the cells were incubated in complete medium at 37°C for 1.5–3.5 h. Before imaging, both somal and axonal compartments were treated with 150 nM LysoTracker Deep Red (Invitrogen, L12492) in complete medium at 37°C for 20 min to label acidic compartments. Cells were washed twice with HBSS, returned to complete medium, and imaged under live-cell imaging conditions.Two-channel time-lapse images were acquired first in the microgroove area to capture motions of reovirus and LysoTracker in axons, and then single snapshots were acquired in the somal compartment to capture distribution of fluorescent markers in the neuronal cell bodies. Reovirus co-trafficking with LysoTracker in axons was inferred from kymographs as described above for analysis of co-transport with dextran and transferrin. To analyze reovirus colocalization with LysoTracker-stained vesicles (red puncta) in soma, background was subtracted from the red channel using a rolling ball radius of 5 for all images. Regions of interest containing reovirus puncta (green) were identified using the “Analyze Particles” function and the intensity of red channel at the corresponding regions was recorded. If the red channel intensity was above background, reovirus punctum was considered to be colocalized with LysoTracker.Quantification of reovirus coresDRGNs cultivated in glass bottom dishes were adsorbed with 3×1010 particles/dish of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled T3SA+ for 30 min. The inoculum was removed and cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated at 37°C for 1–3 h before fixation. Cells were subsequently permeabilized and stained with core-specific rabbit polyclonal serum and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Fluorescence images of single optical sections were acquired through the middle of soma from multiple fields-of-view. The soma were outlined using bright field images and only soma containing internalized reovirus particles as identified from Alexa Fluor 647 signal were considered for further analysis. Fluorescent reovirus core puncta within selected soma were identified using the “Find Maxima” function in Fiji ImageJ and enumerated.Statistical analysisAll data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism 7. Figure legends specify the number of experimental repeats and the statistical test applied for each analysis.

The germ part (see Figure 4) is removed with a razor blade, perpendicular to the crease zone (longitudinal axis) of the grain, and is discarded.()Figure 4. Wheat grain and position of razor blade during wheat germ removal. Both sides of grain are presented to easily localize the germ, brush and crease regions.b.  The grain is then placed in a Petri dish on top of Whatman filter paper moistened with d H_2O , and left at +4~^°C for ^24h .Note: Whole rehydration procedure is skipped for young grains, which are naturally hydrated.2.  Preparing 70um -thin cross sections of wheat grains.a.  This step is done by using a Vibratome instrument according to instruction provided in the Instruction manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2009). The grain is fixed with some glue onto the magnetic plate of the Vibratome. Orientation of the grain should be such that the longitudinal axis of the grain is placed perpendicular to the magnetic plate. Settings of the Vibratome instrument are as follows: frequency: 60; amplitude: 1.2; speed: 12.b.  A series of 400~um -thick slices are cut and discarded, until the surface of the grain becomes flat and parallel to the razor blade of the Vibratome instrument.c.  Thin  sections  (approximately 70 mu m) )  are  then  cut  consecutively  and  placed immediately into Eppendorf tubes filled with 70% ethanol. They are stored at 4~^°C until further processing.3.  Removing starch.a.  The wheat cross section is grabbed using a paint brush and transferred into a clean Eppendorf tube, filled with 0.5 ml of 1m g/m l α-Amylase solution. This is allowed to incubate at 40~^°C for ^24h on a Thermo-shaker.b.  Rinse thoroughly by transferring the wheat cross section into a clean Eppendorf tube filled with 1 ml of d H_2O . Repeat this step twice. Wash the brush in water after each sample transfer. Note: This step is intended to avoid any hydrolysis of starch by endogenous enzyme activity, which would produce some glucans of similar masses as those expected from the hydrolysis of cell walls BG (additionally, when MALDI mass spectrometry is used for further analysis of the tissue, starch generates a strong suppressive effect on the signal).4.  Placing the cross-section onto an ITO glass plate (see Note 5).a.  Prepare the ITO glass plate that will receive the cross section: i.  Place a small piece of adhesive carbon tape at the location where the cross section will be deposited on the ITO glass plate; ii.  With a Pasteur pipette, put a droplet of water on the tape.b.  Then, with a paint brush, grab the cross section from the Eppendorf tube. Lean the cross section at the surface of the water droplet, allowing it to detach from the paint brush. Proceed very gently, so to avoid any disruption or any distortion of the cross section (Figure 5).()# Figure 5. Positioning of grain section during wheat section grabbing a) and deposition onto the ITO plate (b, c)Gently remove excess water with a Kimwipes tissue. Allow sample to dry at RT (approximately 30m i n ) (see Figure 6).()Figure 6. Appearance of the ITO plate with mounted wheat sections on itc.  Mount the ITO glass plate onto the MTP Slide Adapter II (Bruker) according to the manufacturer instructions available in Bruker, (2012).5.  Application of the hydrolytic enzyme on the cross section. a.  This step uses a homemade robot (see Figure 1 and Note 2). The aim is to deliver a controlled volume of enzyme onto the tissue by using an airbrush device, so that fine droplets of enzyme are applied on the tissue, thereby limiting the diffusion of the oligosaccharides released upon digestion over the tissue. b.  Spraying of the enzyme is achieved by connecting the electrospray probe mounted on the robotic arm to a syringe pump delivering the enzymatic solution at a constant flow rate of 600ul/h . i.  Spraying is assisted pneumatically with nitrogen (1.5×10^5P a) . ii.  The distance between the needle tip of the Electrospray probe and the ITO plate is 3 cm (Z-axis). iii.  A X, Y deposition pattern following a “brush rectangle” is used (Figure 7). iv.  The movement speed of the robot head was set at 5mm/s . v.  Other parameters X and Y axis start and end coordinates, volume of the enzyme placed into the syringe, number of spraying cycles) are set to ensure that the robot consistently deposits 0.3~ul of enzyme ( 4.6 cup/ml endo-1,4-  -xylanase or 2 U/ml lichenase) per m m^2 of sprayed area (corresponding to 0.0014 cup xylanase and 0.0006 U lichenase per m m^2 tissue). Enzymes can be applied individually, consecutively or in mixture. Note: Endo-1,4-  -xylanase is used for _A X hydrolysis, while lichenase is used for mixed-linkage BG hydrolysis.()\"brush rectangle\" patternFigure 7. “Brush rectangle” pattern used for enzyme deposition. X and Y “start” and “end” positions are determined from the coordinates of the surface which must be covered by the enzyme.# 6.  Incubation.a.  The wheat cross sections covered by the enzyme in the previous step are allowed to incubate at 40~^°C for 4h .b.  To prevent liquid from evaporating too fast and the enzyme becomes inactive, a wet atmosphere is maintained by placing the ITO plate into a sealed incubation chamber filled with 150ml saturated K_2S O_4 and pre-incubated at 40~^°C .c.  The ITO plate is placed on top of a 50~ml glass beaker weighted with stones and installed into the glass incubator (Figure 2).d.  After incubation, remove the tissues from the incubation chamber and let dry in the open air (approximately 15m i n ).7.  Additional step for MALDI MS measurement of the hydrolyzed cross sections: Deposition of the DMA-DHB MALDI matrix.a.  This step is performed with an automatic vibration vaporization system from Bruker (ImagePrep, see Figure 3) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonik, 2007).b.  The settings are as follows (see Note 6): 1^st Phase: 15 cycles: 12% spray power; 20% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 15 sec incubation time; 30 sec dry time. 2nd Phase: 40 cycles: 20% spray power; 25% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 30 sec incubation time; 60 sec dry time.

Immortalized ZBP1-KO (ZBP1−/−)–MBS MEFs were described earlier (38). HEK293T, U2OS, NIH 3T3, and SKBR3 cells were purchased from ATCC. The following cell lines were received as gifts: SKBR3 from M. Oren, Weizmann Institute of Science (hereafter, “WIS”), Rehovot, Israel; U2OS from Z. Livneh, WIS; N87 from Y. Yarden, WIS; WM983b from M. Herlyn, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia; HEK293 cells expressing PCCND1–CCND1–MBS or PCMV–CCND1–MBS (42) from Y. Shav-Tal, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel; and SV40-immortalized APAF-1–KO MEFs and isogenic WT MEFs (68) from M. Orzáez, Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe (CIPF), Valencia, Spain.MEFs expressing EGFP, NLS–HA–tdMCP–GFP (referred to herein as “tdMCP–GFP”) or palmitoylated TagRFP-T (TagRFP-T-ps) were created by infection with the appropriate lentivirus followed by sorting by flow cytometry to isolate only infected cells. Cells were sorted for low expression levels of EGFP and tdMCP–GFP and for high expression levels of TagRFP-T-ps. WM983b–GFP cells were created by clonal selection, as previously described (69).Plasmids and Lentivirus Generation.A lentivirus vector (pHAGE-UBC-RIG) carrying tdMCP–GFP (Addgene plasmid no. 40649) was previously described (47). DNA sequences encoding EGFP and TagRFP-T-ps were cloned into the same viral backbone vector. Plasma membrane (inner leaflet)-associated TagRFP-T-ps was generated by the addition of a sequence encoding 20 amino acids of rat GAP-43 (MLCCMRRTKQVEKNDEDQKI) (70) to the 5′ end of the TagRFP-T gene.Lentivirus particles were produced by transfecting the expression vector along with plasmids for ENV (pMD2.VSVG), packaging (pMDLg/pRRE), and REV (pRSV-Rev) (Addgene plasmids nos.12259, 12251, and 12253, respectively) into HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate (71). The virus-containing supernatant was harvested and concentrated using a Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus particles were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C for subsequent infection of cells in culture.Cell-Culture Conditions.MEFs, HEK293, HEK293T, and U2OS cells were cultured routinely in 10-cm dishes in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 10 U/mL penicillin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Primary MEFs were cultured in the same medium at 37 °C with 10% CO2 and 3% O2. SKBR3 and N87 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. RPMI 1640 medium was also used for the coculture of either SKBR3 or N87 cells with MEFs that were preconditioned to RPMI 1640. WM983b cells were cultured in Tu 2% medium (78.4% MCDB153 medium, 19.6% Leibovitz’s l-15 medium, 2% FBS, and 1.68 mM CaCl2).FN (10 µg/mL in PBS; Sigma) was used to coat round 18-mm no. 1 glass coverslips for FISH experiments and the glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek catalog no. P35G-1.5–14-C) for live imaging. For some experiments, poly-d-lysine (Sigma) was used to coat coverslips at 1 mg/mL or 0.1 mg/mL, as indicated. Cells were dissociated from the dishes using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and were plated on freshly coated coverslips. We found that the coculturing of donor and acceptor cells immediately after dissociation tends to reduce the transfer efficiency of β-actin–MBS mRNA. Therefore, acceptor cells were typically plated the day before coculture (i.e., in the afternoon/evening), and donor cells then were plated on top the next morning, unless otherwise indicated. The acceptor:donor ratio was 1:1 unless otherwise indicated. Coculture was performed for 30 min to 24 h, as indicated, before fixation and FISH analysis as detailed below. For live imaging, cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dishes, as described above, using DMEM/10%FBS medium. The coculture was maintained for 1–2 h in the incubator. During that time, the microscope’s environmental control chamber was warmed to 37 °C with humidity control and normal atmosphere. The medium was then replaced with prewarmed Leibovitz’s l-15 medium lacking phenol red and containing 10% FBS, and the cells were taken for imaging. Imaging sessions of live cells lasted between 1 and 10 h. Experiments using WM983b cells were performed using uncoated glass, and cocultures (plated at a ratio of 1:1) were incubated for 48 h before FISH analysis. In all cases, cell density upon plating in coculture was calculated to achieve ∼80 ± 10% confluence at the time of fixation or live imaging.For tripod experiments, paraffin was heated to ∼110 °C. By using a glass pipette, paraffin drops (2–3 mm in height) were placed in a triangular arrangement at three points on the coverslip edges. Once the paraffin solidified, coverslips were exposed to UV light (using the tissue-culture hood lamp) for 30 min. Tripods were stored under sterile conditions at room temperature until used. For transwell experiments, Corning Transwell multiple-well plates with permeable polycarbonate 0.4-µm or 5-µm membrane inserts (Fisher Scientific catalog no. 07–200-147 or 07-200-149) were used.The following drugs were added directly to the culture medium: 100 µg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma), 1 µM CASIN (a gift of V. Krizhanovsky, WIS), 200 nM LatA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 100 µM carbenoxolone (Sigma), and 10 µM raptinal (gift of P. Hergenrother, University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, Urbana–Champaign, IL). Drugs were added 20–30 min after plating of the donor cells (i.e., after MBS MEFs have attached). For the induction of protein folding or oxidative stress, 0.1 mM DTT (Sigma) or 1 mM H2O2 was added directly to the medium, and cells were further incubated for 1.5 h. Serum starvation was induced by replacing the medium with DMEM lacking FBS, and the cells were further incubated for the indicated times. Heat shock was induced by submerging cells that were precultured on coverslips in a sealed 12-well plate for 1 h in a 42-°C water bath. Following incubation under stress conditions, the stressed cells were washed with prewarmed medium; then the other (nonstressed) cell type was added, and the cells were cocultured for the indicated times under stress-free conditions. For the apoptosis-tripod experiment, cells grown on tripod coverslips were first treated with 3 mM H2O2 for 1.5 h before coculture. After an additional 2.5 h of culture in medium lacking H2O2, ∼45% of MBS MEFs were dead. The percentage of cell death was determined using trypan blue staining.FISH and FISH-IF.Tiled FISH probes (20-mers) against the MBS sequence (comprising three oligos with amino-allyl moieties on both the 5′ and 3′ ends) and the β-actin ORF (comprising 35 5′ and 3′ amino-allyl oligos) (23) were end-labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Healthcare), as previously described (72). Tiled FISH probes (20-mers) against human BRCA1-Quasar (Q)570 (ShipReady catalog no. SMF-2028-1), human HER2-Q570 (DesignReady catalog no. VSMF-2102-5), and custom probe sets against HSP70 (73) and LTag-Q670 mRNAs were obtained from Biosearch Technologies. Tiled odds/evens dual-color 20-mer probes against GFP and human MITF, SERP2, MT2A, and MALAT1 were purchased as 3′-amine oligos from Biosearch Technologies. These oligos were coupled to Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies) fluorophores and purified by HPLC, as previously described (41).FISH was performed at the R.H.S./J.E.G. laboratories as previously described (22), with slight modifications (a detailed protocol is given in SI Materials and Methods). FISH at the A.R. laboratory was performed on WM983b cells according to the Biosearch Stellaris RNA FISH protocol.For FISH-IF experiments, cell fixation and permeabilization were performed as described for FISH. Prehybridization was performed in prehybridization buffer (PHB) (10% formamide in 2× SSC) supplemented with 3% BSA (Sigma) and RNase inhibitor [10 U/mL SUPERase (Ambion) or RNasin (Promega)]. For hybridization, 20 U/mL SUPERase or RNasin and primary chicken (IgY) anti-GFP antibody (GFP-1010) (1:5,000) (Aves Labs), as well as the FISH probes, were added to the hybridization mix. Samples were incubated in a humid chamber in the dark at 37 °C for exactly 3 h. Following hybridization, coverslips were rinsed twice in PHB and then incubated twice for 30 min at 37 °C in PHB supplemented with 3% BSA and secondary goat anti-chicken IgY antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (A21449) (1:1,000) (Life Technologies ). Samples were further washed, DAPI stained, and mounted on slides as for FISH.Imaging.FISH and FISH-IF images were taken using different microscopes, as detailed in SI Materials and Methods. Exposure times for imaging varied among different cell cultures, probes, dyes, and microscopes and were determined empirically per experiment. All slides from the same experiment were imaged using the same illumination parameters. Examples of z-stacked FISH images of donor, acceptor, and cocultured cells are provided in Movies S7–S9). Live imaging was performed on an Olympus IX-71 total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) station customized for laser illumination as detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Image Analysis and Data Presentation.Microscope images presented in the figures and movies were minimally processed for brightness and contrast using the FIJI program (74). The plots depicted in Fig. S3E were generated in FIJI by using the “straight line” tool to measure pixel intensity. Analysis of smFISH images to quantify FISH spots was performed using either in-house–developed MATLAB programs or FQ (36). Airlocalize (23) was used at the R.H.S. laboratory for the experiments depicted in Figs. 1 D and E and 4A and Fig. S7B. All experiments involving WM983b cells were analyzed at the A.R. laboratory with Rajlabimagetools (75). FQ was used in the analysis of all other experiments. For more details, see SI Materials and Methods. Examples of images that were analyzed by FQ are provided in Figs. S1 A and B and S10. The data presented in all graphs and in Dataset S1 represent data collected from two or more experiments. In a few cases that showed distinct subpopulations (i.e., Figs. S3 A and B and S6A) the different experiments were color-coded. The immortalized data in Fig. S1C were pooled from all experiments with MBS MEFs.Fig. S10.Screen-shots of FQ image analysis. Depicted are screen-shots of the FQ spot inspector FQ version 3 (A–C) and FQ version 2d (D). A–C are from the same experiment and depict a single z section image; D depicts a maximum-projection image. Analyzed cells are outlined in yellow: shown are acceptor cells after coculture bearing either a high number of transferred mRNAs (A) or a low number of transferred mRNAs (D), acceptor cells cultured alone (C), and donor MBS MEFs in coculture (B). Green circles represent selected spots; red circles represent automatically rejected spots based on FQ analysis parameters; magenta circles represent manually rejected spots (as explained in Materials and Methods). Also shown are the data for parameters SigmaXY, SigmaZ, Amplitude, and Background of a single selected accepted (A, B, and D) or rejected (C) spot (note: selected spots are marked by a black square in the image). The data are shown on the left of the image, and a visual representation of the selected spots on the x,y, x,z, or y,z axes is shown to the right of the image. The individual images are derived from Movies S7–S9.Statistical Analysis.Unpaired t tests were used to calculate P values (depicted in Dataset S1) for each two sets of compared results.

All fly lines used in this work were backcrossed with w1118 strain in order to minimize the differences in the genetic background.Larval movementPeristaltic waves of third instar larvae were performed as already described in [17]. Briefly, larvae, after genotype selection, were rinsed in water and transferred to a 0.7% agarose dish (94 mm diameter), and peristaltic waves were counted for a period of 2 min. A minimum of 20 animals were analyzed for each genotype to reach a statistically representative population.Drug treatment of larvaeParental fly crosses were settled on standard cornmeal added of the below-listed drugs with the reported final concentration: stavudine 10 μM, azidotimidine 10 μM, tenofovir 10 μM, abacavir (#SML0089 Sigma) 10 μM, rilpivirine (#10410 Sigma) 10 μM, enoxacin (#AB143281 Abcam) 10 μM, and lamivudine (#L1295 Sigma) 10 μM. For each drug, a vehicle-only control group was arranged. Parental flies have been maintained 24 h in the tubes to allow the embryo laying. Synchronized embryos were grown to obtain third instar larvae to be tested for mobility or to be analyzed for NMJ morphology.RNA extraction and microarray analysisRNA, both from adult dissected brains and adult heads, was extracted with the RNeasy Microarray tissue kit (QIAGEN #73304). Gene expression analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates by GenoSplice company on the Affymetrix platform using Gene Chip Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array. RNAs extracted from Drosophila adult heads, 1 day aged and sex-matched, of both wild-type and TBPH-null alleles (tbphΔ23 and tbphΔ142) were subjected to quality control tests before chip hybridization. The min-fold change for both upregulated and downregulated genes was settled to 1.5.Immunohistochemistry, confocal, and acquisitionThird instar larvae bodies were dissected and stained as previously described [19]. Larvae were dissected in HL-3, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 20 min (5 min in methanol for anti-GluRIIA), and subsequently blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Vector laboratories #S-1000) in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C, while secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Dilutions of the antibodies used are reported as follows: anti-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch 1:150), anti-HRP-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 1:150), anti-GluRIIA 8B4D2c (DSHB 1:15), anti-GFP (Life Technology 1:200), Alexa-Fluor® 488 (mouse or rabbit 1:500), and Alexa- Fluor® 555 (mouse or rabbit 1:500).Stained larvae were mounted with SlowFade Gold (#S36936 Thermo Fisher Scientific), and images of muscles 6 and 7 of the second abdominal segments were gained on a Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning microscope (× 63 oil lens). All acquisitions performed in these experiments were simultaneously processed using the same microscope settings and subsequently analyzed by ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, NIH) and Prism (GraphPad, USA) software.Quantification of confocal imagesAnimals analyzed for these experiments were processed simultaneously and images acquired with the same settings. For the GluRIIA quantification, samples were double labeled with anti-GluRIIA and anti-HRP: the mean intensity of both was quantified and a ratio calculated [19, 44]. To label the peripheral glia that covers the presynaptic terminals at the NMJ level, a membrane-tethered green fluorescent protein (UAS—mCD8-GFP) was expressed using Repo-GAL4 driver. The quantification of glial area was calculated analyzing the ratio between the area occupied by glial tissue and the area of the presynaptic terminal [20]. All the data were normalized on the control.Cell culture and RNA interferenceSH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was cultured in DMEM-GlutaMAX (#31966-021, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (#A5955; Sigma). For RNA interference, 2–4 × 105 cells were seeded in a 60-mm plate in 2 mL of medium containing 10% fetal serum. Two rounds of silencing, for a total of 48 h silencing, were carried out. HiPerfect Transfection Reagent (#301705, Qiagen) and Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (#51985-026, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used with a 200-nM final concentration of siRNA, (TDP43: 5′-gcaaagccaagaugagccu-3′ and EGFP control: 5′-gcaccaucuucuucaagga-3′; Sigma). Silenced cells were collected by trypsinization, lysed in RIPA buffer, and immunoblotted.ImmunoblotDrosophila adult heads or brains were homogenized in lysis buffer 1× (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM DTT, 4 M urea, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors and protein content quantified with Quant-iT Protein Assay Kit (#Q33211 Thermo Fisher Scientific). SH-SY5Y cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer (NaCl 150 mM, NP-40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.5%, SDS 0.1%, EDTA 2 mM, Tris 50 mM, pH 8.0) added to protease inhibitors, and protein lysates were quantified by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and wet-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (#NBA083C, Whatman). The primary antibody used were anti-Env (1:100 gifted by Prof. Christophe Terzian), anti-Dcr-2 (1:300 #ab4732, Abcam), anti-h-Dicer (1:3000, #PA5-78446, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-hTDP (1:4000, #12892-1-AP, ProteinTech), anti-GFP (1:3000, #A11122, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-TBPH (1:4000, homemade, [17], anti-GAPDH (1:1000 #sc-25778, Santa Cruz), anti-tubulin (1:2000, #CP06, Calbiochem), anti-actin (1:3000, Sigma).Immunoprecipitation for protein-protein interactionApproximately one hundred Drosophila heads for each genotype (GMR-GAL4/UAS-TBPH and GMR-GAL4/+) were collected by flash freezing and homogenized in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 110 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche #11836170001)) with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were subjected to 0.4g centrifugation for 5 min to remove the largest debris and protein content quantified by BCA (#23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal protein amounts were added to protein G magnetic beads (#10003D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (#F3165, Sigma). After an overnight incubation on rototor at 4 °C, beads were subjected to washes and finally heated 70 °C for 10 min in 1× SDS-PAGE loading dye to elute immunoprecipitated proteins that were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-TBPH, anti-Dicer2, anti-GAPDH, and anti-Actin.Immunoprecipitation for RNA enrichmentDrosophila heads collected by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen (elav-GAL4/UAS-TBPH and elav-GAL4/+;UAS-TBPH-RBDmut/+) were homogenized in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT plus protease inhibitors (Roche #11836170001)) with a Dounce homogenizer and the lysate subjected to 0.4g centrifugation for 5 min to remove the largest debris. Cleared lysates were added to protein G magnetic beads (#10003D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (#F3165, Sigma) and incubated 4 °C for half an hour. After five washes with immunoprecipitation buffer, beads were TRIzol (#15596-026, Ambion) treated to extract RNA.qRT-PCRRNA was DNAse treated with the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (#AM1907, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and retrotranscribed with Oligo (dT)20 Primer (#18418020, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (#18080-093, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Courtship tests start roughly 30 min after the end of SD. Courtship index, which is the percentage of observation time a male fly performs courtship, was used to measure courtship to female targets, and measured manually using the LifeSongX software.Female receptivity assayWild-type virgin females (4–6 days old) were sleep-deprived and aspirated into round two-layer chambers (diameter: 1 cm; height: 2.5 mm per layer), and separated from 4- to 6-day-old wild-type virgin males until courtship test for 15 min. Courtship tests start roughly 30 min after the end of SD.Sleep test and analysisIndividual 2–4-day-old males or females were placed in locomotor activity monitor tubes (DAM2, TriKinetics Inc.) with fly food, and were entrained in 21.5 or 25 °C 12 h:12 h light:dark conditions for at least 2 days before sleep test. For temperature-shifting experiments, 2-day sleep data were recorded at 21.5 °C as baseline, and then flies were shifted to 28.5 °C (dTrpA1) or 29.5 °C (dTrpA1 and shi ts1) for 2 days, and returned to 21.5 °C for at least 1 day to measure sleep recovery. Sleep was analyzed using custom-designed Matlab software63. The total sleep amounts per day (e.g., Fig. 8b) are the average sleep amounts in multiple testing days. The sexual difference of sleep (Fig. 8c) is defined as the total sleep of females subtracted from the total sleep of males of the same genotype, and divided by the total sleep of males. Change in total sleep (e.g., Fig. 2f) is the percentage of sleep change in the first day of temperature shift (28.5 or 29.5 °C) compared to baseline sleep at 21.5 °C.Sleep deprivationSD was performed either in food vials or in DAM2 monitors that are fixed in a multitube vortexer. The vortexer shakes the vials or monitors in an intermittent way (in total ~15 s/min shaking unless specifically described) controlled by the TriKineticsDAMSystem software33.Tissue dissection, staining, and imagingBrains and ventral nerve cords of 4–6-day-old males and females were dissected in Schneider’s insect medium (S2) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in S2 medium for 50–60 min at room temperature. After 4 × 10-min washing in PAT (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), tissues were blocked in 3% normal goat serum (NGS) for 90 min, then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 3% NGS for 12–24 h at 4 °C, then washed in PAT, and incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in 3% NGS for 1–2 days at 4 °C. Tissues were then washed thoroughly in PAT and mounted for imaging. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen A11122) 1:1000, mouse anti-Bruchpilot (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank nc82) 1:30, and secondary Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 antibodies (1:500). Samples were imaged at ×20 magnification on Zeiss 700 or 710 confocal microscopes and processed with Fiji software.Brain image registrationThe standard brain used in this study is described previously44. Confocal images for R18H11-LexA and P1-splitGAL4 were registered onto this standard brain with a Fiji graphical user interface as described previously64, 65.P2X2 activation and GCamp6m imagingTo gain access to the P1 or DN1 neurons for ATP application, whole-brain explants were placed on 8-mm diameter circular coverslips and placed in a recording chamber containing external solution (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM N-tris methyl-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, and 4 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). For an early experiment (Fig. 6a–c), an ATP ejection electrode was filled with freshly prepared 10 mM ATP solution and positioned near P1 neurons using a micromanipulator. The ATP was ejected by applying a 25-ms pressure pulse at 20 psi using a picospritzer (Parker Hannifin, Precision Fluidics Division, NH). The picospritizer was triggered by Zeiss image acquisition and processing software Zen pro 2012. Later, we added ATP simply using a pipette, but the final ATP concentration is still 10 mM (Fig. 6d–f). Calcium imaging was performed using Zeiss AxoExaminer Z1 upright microscope with W Plan Apochromat 40 × water immersion objective. GCamp6m was excited with a 470-nm LED light source (Colibiri, Zeiss) and images were acquired using ORCA-R2 C10600-10B digital charged-couple device (CCD) camera (Hamamastu, Japan) at 3 Hz. The average fluorescence of all pixels for each time point in a defined region of interest (ROI) was subtracted from the average background fluorescence of the same size ROI within the brain region. The resulting fluorescence value for each time point was defined as Ft. % ΔF/F 0 = (F t−F 0)/F 0 × 100, where F 0 corresponds to average of 10 frames of background-subtracted baseline fluorescence before ATP application. All images were processed and quantified using Zen and Fiji (Image J).Arc light imagingImaging of freshly dissected brain explants was performed on a Zeiss Axio Examiner upright microscope using a W Plan Apochromat ×40 N.A. 1.0 water immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany). ArcLight was excited with a 470 nm LED (Zeiss). The objective C-mount image was projected onto the 80 × 80 pixel chip of a NeuroCCD-SM camera controlled by NeuroPlex software (RedShirtImaging, Decatur, GA). Images were recorded at a frame rate of 100 Hz, and depicted optical traces were spatial averages of intensity of all pixels within the ROI, with signals processed as previously reported47. Statistical analysis and plotting of the data were performed using R. Sleep-deprived flies and sleep-replete controls were dissected within a few minutes of sleep-deprivation and recorded at the same ZT.Data availabilityWe declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files or from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5533705.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"An Improved and Simplified Radial Gel Diffusion Assay for the Detection of Xylanase Activity","text":"An Improved and Simplified Radial Gel Diffusion Assay for the Detection of Xylanase Activity\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 90×15mm Petri plates (SARSTEDT AG, catalog number: 82.1473001)\n2.  0.5-cm-diameter drinking straw\n3. 150ml Erlenmeyer flask\n4.

All transgenic mice used in this study have a C57BL/6 background. CX3CR1GFP/+ mice (Jung et al., 2000), Rosa26-yfp and CX3CR1creER mice (JAX stock no. 20940 B6J.129-Cx3cr1<tm1.1[cre/ERT2]Jung>/J; Yona et al., 2013), and Ubow mice, provided by M. Bajenoff (Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France; Ghigo et al., 2013) were used. Experiments were performed on mice at the indicated age. In vivo procedures were performed under specific pathogen–free conditions following protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of Marseille in accordance with institutional, national, and European regulations (approval nos. APAFIS 3292-2015 1221 09359224 and APAFIS 10545-2017 0710 08253541).Genetic fate mappingTo genetically fate map progeny of cells expressing CX3CR1, CX3CR1CreER mice were crossed onto R26-yfp mice, and pregnant CX3CR1CreER:R26-yfp females were administered a single dose of TAM (Sigma) at E9. TAM was complemented with progesterone (Sigma), dissolved in ethanol and diluted 10-fold in corn oil (Sigma). The freshly prepared solution was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.1 mg TAM and 0.05 mg progesterone per gram body weight. For induction of Cre recombinase in 8-wk-old CX3CR1CreER R26-yfp mice, 4 mg TAM, dissolved in 200 µl of corn oil, was injected twice subcutaneously 48 h apart.Neonatal hematopoietic cell transplantationTotal BM was obtained from long bones according to standard procedures. Adult (8–12 wk) Ubow mice that express dTomato under the control of the human ubiquitin–C promoter (Ghigo et al., 2013) were used as donors for BM cells. RBCs from total dTomato BM were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (CliniSciences). Five million cells were injected in 20 µl PBS intrahepatically into newborn pups using a micro-fine syringe with 8-mm needles (Micro-Fine 0.3 ml; BD).In vivo BrdU incorporationTo assess DNA synthesis as readout for proliferation, mice were pulsed with BrdU (Sigma) for 4 h before euthanization and organ harvest. Mice were administered 0.1 mg BrdU per gram body weight either subcutaneously (newborn pubs) or intraperitoneally. BrdU incorporation was measured using a BrdU Flow kit (BD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Leukocyte isolation from mouse tissuesThe tunica albuginea of resected testes was opened, and cells were transferred into RPMI medium containing 1 mg/ml Collagenase II (Worthington Biochemicals) and 0.15 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Testis-resident leukocytes were obtained through enzymatic digestion at 37°C for 40 min and passage through 70-µm cell strainers (BD Falcon). Brain tissue was macerated and taken up in HBSS containing 0.5% d-glucose (Sigma) and 15 mM Hepes (Life Technologies). The resulting cell suspension was passed through 70-µm cell strainers and subjected to a 70/37/30% Percoll gradient, from which microglia were isolated. Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated by density centrifugation using Lymphoprep reagent (Stem Cell Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions were preincubated with an antibody blocking Fc receptors (TruStain Fx anti-CD16/32; clone 2.4G2; Biolegend). Subsequently, fixable live/dead staining reagents were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Zombie Dyes; Biolegend). Staining for expression of surface antigens was performed for 20 min at 4°C. The following antibodies were used throughout this study: anti-CD45–BV421 (clone 30F11; Biolegend), anti-F4/80–BV785 (clone BM8; Biolegend), anti-CD11b–BV605 (clone M1/70; BD), anti-CD64–PerCP/Cy5.5 (X54-5/7.1; Biolegend), anti-CD14–APC (Sa2-8; eBioscience), anti-MerTK–biotin (RD Systems), anti-CD11c–BV711 (clone N418; Biolegend), anti-CD115–BV421 (clone AFS98; Biolegend), anti-Ly6C–APC/Cy7 (clone HK1.4; Biolegend), and anti–I-A/I-E (MHCII)–PE/Cy7 (clone M5/114.15.2; Biolegend). Biotinylated antibodies were detected with streptavidin-PE and -BV786 (BD). For HS/PC isolation, total BM cells were depleted from mature cells by staining with biotinylated rat anti–mouse lineage antibody cocktail, followed by streptavidin immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Lineage-negative cells were stained with HS/PC markers: anti-CD117–APC-H7 (clone 2B8; BD), anti-Sca1–PE-Cy5 (clone D7; Biolegend), streptavidin-APC (eBioscience), and LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead cell dye (Invitrogen) as a viability marker. Data were acquired on an LSRII instrument (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Flow cytometry cell sorting was performed on ARIA and ARIA SORP systems (BD).IF and confocal imagingResected testes were fixed in Antigen-Fix reagent (Diapath) for 2 h at 4°C, washed in phosphate buffer, and dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C. Samples were embedded in TissueTek medium (Sakura Finetek), frozen at −80°C, and cut into 20-µm sections for the entire organ using a cryostat (CM3050S; Leica). Slides were blocked 20 min at room temperature in PBS/2% BSA/1% donkey serum/1% FCS/0.1% saponin and stained overnight at 4°C with the indicated antibodies. The following antibodies were used throughout this study: anti-F4/80–Alexa Fluor 647 (clone BM8; Biolegend), anti-MHCII–efluor450 (clone M5/114.15.2; ebioscience), and anti–M-CSFR (C-20; Santa Cruz). After three washes in PBS/0.05% saponin, anti–M-CSFR antibody was detected with anti–rabbit–Alexa Fluor 594 (Jackson Immunoresearch), and visualization of YFP+ cells was enhanced using an anti-GFP antibody (Life Technologies). Slides were mounted in medium containing Sytox blue dye (Prolong Sytox; Life Technologies). Confocal microscopy acquisitions were performed on a confocal microscope (LSM780; Zeiss) at room temperature, and slides were imaged with a 40×/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective (Plan-Apochromat). Different lasers were used (405, 488, 561, and 633 nm) to excite the fluorophores (Sytox blue, eFluor 450, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, and Alexa Fluor 647). Fluorescence was recorded in individual channels acquired in a sequential mode to avoid cross talk using a highly sensitive 32-channel gallium arsenide phosphide detector. The pinhole was set to 1 airy unit. Image processing was done with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Only a median filter was performed on the images to remove salt and pepper noise. For quantification in wild-type mice, macrophages corresponding to a total of 450–680 tubes were counted per individual mouse and scored for localization and expression of M-CSFR and MHCII. Quantification of fate mapped or BM transplantation–derived macrophages was based on scoring 100–200 YFP+ or 100–500 Tomato+ cells, respectively.Gene expression analysis by microfluidic real-time PCRTotal mRNA was extracted from FACS-sorted bulk populations of 5,000 cells. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed with a µMACS one step T7 template kit (Miltenyi). Specific target gene expression was detected according to Fluidigm protocols as previously described (Soucie et al., 2016). In brief, after 10 cycles of cDNA preamplification, microfluidic real-time PCR was performed using Dynamic Array integrated fluidic circuits (Biomark; Fluidigm) with TaqMan gene expression assays (ABI) or primer assay in 96.96 Dynamic Arrays on a BioMark System (Fluidigm).

Culture adherent HCT116 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (glucose 4.5 /L) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics ( 100 cup/ ml penicillin and 100 u/m l streptomycin) at 37~^°C in a humidified 5% C O_2/95% air atmosphere. Culture suspended DT40 cells at a density of 1×10^5-1×10^6 cells per ml in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum and antibiotics ( 100 cup/ ml penicillin and 100 u g/m l streptomycin) at 39.5^°C in a humidified 5% ,C O_2/95% air atmosphere.2.  Transfect 8.0×10^5H C T116 cells ( 40-60% confluent in 6-well plate) using 1 u of plasmid DNA, 300~ul of Opti-mem and 10~ul of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for one well according to the manufacturers’ instructions (After the transfection medium is not replaced). To obtain 1.05×10^7cells transfected cells, electroporate three times 3.5×10^6 DT40 cells with 8~u plasmid DNA with two pulses at 1,500~forall for 15 msec according to the manufacturer’s instructions.3.  Collect approximately 2.0×10^6 HCT116 cells or 4.0×10^6 DT40 cells for further analysis 24~h (HCT116 cell) or 16~h (DT40 cells) after transfection. For this the cells are washed with 1~ml PBS three times, scraped off and centrifuged at 3,000xg for 2 min at 4~^°C . Discard the supernatants of samples and suspend cell pellets in 400~ul (for HCT116 cells) or 250~ul (for DT40 cells) buffer A and incubate for 20 min on ice to lyse the cells. We used smaller amount of buffer A for DT40 cells, because DT40 cells do not contain as much proteins as HCT116 cells. After this step, samples from HCT116 cells and DT40 cells are treated in the same manner. Note: Important, the buffer A must NOT contain protease inhibitor cocktail as it would inhibit trypsin activity.4.  Clarify cell lysates by centrifugation at 17,800xg for 10 min at 4~^°C and transfer the supernatants to new tubes. Pellets are discarded.5.  To allow trypsin processing of misfolded proteins, incubate 50~ul aliquots (in case of protein concentrations of 1m g/m l) of the cleared lysates with 1~ul trypsin solution (Test different concentrations from 1 u/ml to 100 u/m l) for 15 min at 4^°C . To stop the trypsin reaction, mix samples with 40-50ul of buffer B supplemented with 10× protease inhibitor cocktail (We usually use high inhibitor concentrations: 5× final) and incubate at 100~^°C for 5 min. Important, every 3 min four samples could be handled for equal incubation time with trypsin.6.  Separate 10ul of the samples (approximately 5ug ) by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using PVDF membrane and probing with an antibody against the protein of interest. Percentage of SDS-PAGE depends on the molecular weight of the protein of interest. Band intensities can be analyzed and compared to each other by ImageJ or similar programs (Figure 1).()AhATF6α(C)-myctConcentration of trypsin (μg/ml)Figure 1. Severely misfolded mutants were more sensitive to trypsin. A. Chicken EDEM1/2/3 triple KO cells (gEDEM TKO) were described previously (Ninagawa et al., 2015). The indicated myc-tagged hATF6α(C) variants were transiently express in gEDEM-TKO cells and subjected to trypsin sensitivity assay. After the indicated time points the trypsin reaction was stopped and samples analyzed by a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the myc-tag. The data shown represents a single representative experiment out of three repeats. Less folded proteins are more sensitive to trypsin, so the hATF6α(C)-myct mutants, Δ111-119, 182-194 mutant and Δ219-270 mutant were cleaved by lower trypsin concentrations. B. Quantification of band intensities shown in (A) by ImageJ and calculation of the percentage of remaining protein. C. Equal loading of cell lysates shown by immunoblotting of the lysates and probing with an antibody against  -actin.# Notes1.  Incubation time with trypsin and concentration of trypsin should be optimized for proteins of interests.2.  The lot and freshness of trypsin can affect the result and can change the outcome between independent experiments (We use trypsin stored at 4~^°C_,^ . Anyway, you can compare the tightness of the folding among proteins of interests.3.  Dilute trypsin in PBS to obtain the expected concentration.4.  We used gEDEM TKO cells. This method is applicable for a wide variety of cells lines and recombinant proteins.5.  This method can be applied to recombinant proteins. In this case, you might reduce concentration of trypsin.6.  CPY and CPY* (Izawa et al., 2012), and GFP and GFP variants (Xu et al., 2013) were other examples used in this assay. We can provide plasmids to express hATF6α(C)-myct 1-302 and Δ280-298 for positive controls (Folded), and Δ111-119, 182-194 and Δ219-270 for negative controls (Less folded).# Recipes1.

Note that this strain of Nlgn3KO mice contains a transcriptional stop cassette19 preventing genetic compensation events that might be triggered in mutants expressing truncated mRNAs49. For dopamine neuron-specific manipulations DAT-Cre BAC transgenic mice were employed50. Mice were kept on a C57BL/6j background. All animals were group housed (weaning at P21 – P23) under a 12h light – dark cycle (6:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.) with food and water ad libitum. All physiology and behavior experiments were performed during the light cycle. Embryos for cortical cultures were obtained from NMRI mice (Janvier). All the procedures performed at University of Lausanne and Biozentrum complied with the Swiss National Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experimentation and were approved by the respective Swiss Cantonal Veterinary Office Committees for Animal Experimentation.Pharmacokinetics of ETC-168A group of twenty-seven male C57BL/6 mice were administered with ETC-168 solution formulation in 7.5% NMP, 5% Solutol HS, 10% PG, 30% PEG-400, 47.5% Normal Saline at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Blood samples (approximately 60μl) were collected under light isoflurane anesthesia from retro orbital plexus at PD, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr. Plasma samples were separated by centrifugation of whole blood and stored below −70°C until analysis. Immediately after collection of blood, brain samples were collected from each mouse at PD, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr. Brain samples were homogenized using ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) and homogenates were stored below −70°C until analysis. Total homogenate volume was three times the tissue weight. All samples were processed for analysis by protein precipitation using acetonitrile and analyzed with fit-for-purpose LC/MS/MS method (LLOQ – 2.00 ng/mL in plasma and 1.00 ng/mL in brain). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the non-compartmental analysis tool of Phoenix WinNonlin® (Version 6.3).Pharmacological treatmentFor in vitro experiments, ETC-168 was dissolved in DMSO. For in vivo treatment, ETC-168 was dissolved in 0.5% Methylcellulose (Sigma, M7140) and 0.1% Tween-80 (Sigma, P5188) in MilliQ water to 1.25 mg/ml, and sonicated for 30 min. Animals were gavaged 24h and 2h before behavioral assessment or tissue collection for acute treatment. In the chronic treatment regime, animals were treated every 24 h and two hours before start of the evaluation. The OXTR antagonist L-368,899 (Tocris, #2641) was dissolved in saline and 10 mg/kg was applied via i.p. injection 2h before the start of behavioural assessments, or 15 min before the final dose of ETC-168.Stereotaxic injectionInjections of diluted (1:4) Red Retrobead™ were done at P19-P23 and performed under isoflurane anesthesia (Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria). The animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instrument) and a single craniotomy was made over the NAc medial shell at the following stereotaxic coordinates: ML 0.55 mm, AP 1.5 mm, DV −4.05 mm from bregma. Injections were made with a 30-G Hamilton needle (Hamilton, 7762-03) for a total volume of 300 nL. Injection sites were confirmed post-hoc by immunostaining. For electrophysiological experiments, the animals were left 5-8 days after injection before the start of experiment.For Nlgn3 conditional knock-down experiments, injections of purified AAV2-DIO-miRNlgn3-GFP and AAV2-DIO-miR-GFP were performed as described previously31. Briefly, DAT-cre transgenic mice were injected at postnatal day 5 – 6 and a single craniotomy was made over the VTA at following stereotaxic coordinates: ML +0.15 mm, AP +0.2 mm, DV −4.2 mm from lambda for P5-P6. Injections were made with a 33-G Hamilton needle (Hamilton, 65460-02) for a total volume of 200 nL. Behavioral testing was performed at postnatal day 28 and injections sites were confirmed post-hoc by immunostaining as described previously31. Briefly, VTA::DANL3KD mice were included if a minimum of 20% of TH-positive cells in the VTA were GFP-positive. Mice were excluded from the analysis if their body weight was less than 75% of the body weight at the start of behavioral trials or in case post-hoc analysis revealed inefficient or off-target viral infection.Habituation/novelty recognition taskSocial recognition is considered to be commonly affected in individuals on the autism spectrum. Autistic individuals perform poorly on face identity recognition tasks, especially when a medium to high time delay (seconds to several minutes) between face presentation is applied51,52. To model social recognition in juvenile male mice we adopted previous protocols that had been developed for adult rodents10,53. In this test, recognition between juvenile male mice (postnatal day 26 – 32) was tested with 5 minute inter-trial intervals that mimic the timescales of recognition tasks from patient studies. An experimental cage similar to the animal’s home cage was used with grid, food, and water removed. The experimental animals were acclimated in the cage for 30 min before the start of the test. At the start of the first trial, a novel same-sex mouse (stimulus mouse: C57BL/6J juvenile male mice, P21-P28) or an object (Lego block) was introduced into the cage for 2 min and mice were left to freely interact. This was repeated for 4 consecutive trials with 5 min in-between trial intervals to allow habituation to the stimulus mouse or object. On the 5th trial, a novel mouse (littermate to the stimulus mouse) or a novel object (dice) was introduced. For the social stimulus, interaction was scored when the experimental mouse initiated the action and when the nose of the animal was oriented toward the social stimulus mouse only. For the object stimulus, interaction was scored when nose of the mouse was oriented 1 cm or less towards the object. The interaction time was used to calculate the recognition index as: (Interaction trial 5) - (Interaction trial 4). Social recognition in rodents has been reported to depend on oxytocin signaling11,54. To pharmacologically validate the recognition task, we treated mice with the oxytocin receptor antagonist (L-368,899 10 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally 2 hrs before testing). This treatment significantly suppressed recognition of novel conspecifics in this task (see Fig.1k,l).Place-independent cue discrimination and reversal taskAdult male mice were used for this test. The test box (25 × 35 cm) was divided in a waiting and a reward zone by a gated plexiglass wall. Reward (condensed milk) was associated to one of the two lining patterns of a double tray (white tape vs brown sandpaper). The tray was turned in a pseudorandom fashion between trials in order to present the rewarded pattern on the right and the left 8 times within a daily session of 16 trials. Sliding lids were used to prevent nosepoke in the correct target after the mouse made a wrong choice, and to signal end of a trial and return to the waiting zone after the bait has been consumed. Before the start of the trial, mice were food deprived overnight and the reward was presented in the home cage to habituate to the reward. For the duration of the test, mice were food restricted overnight and receive food ad libitum after completion of the discrimination task. After the first night of food deprivation, mice were brought to the testing arena where they find condensed milk droplets (15 μl) in falcon lids similar to those used for the test. First day of habituation takes place in groups of cage mates, second day in individual session. Mice were shaped to shuttle to the waiting compartment of the arena after having consumed the reward. On day 1, mice were trained to find the reward only in one of two adjacent falcon lids that have been lined and mounted on little stages with a different pattern (brown sandpaper vs white tape). Each mouse undergoes 16 daily trials, with a cutoff of 20 minutes. Mice not completing 16 trials by the third testing day were excluded from further testing. Mice not attaining learning criterion for the first contingency (8 consecutive correct responses over two days), after 6 days of training did not go to the reversal learning step (nor received any treatment). Mice were trained for 6 consecutive days/week. Feeding was restricted to 1 g/mouse overnight. On day 7 (day 1 of reversal learning training), mice received ETC-168 5 mg/kg or vehicle by gavage 120 min before starting the tests for the duration of the reversal task. For the contingency reversal learning, mice were trained to nosepoke in the previously non-baited pattern in order to find reward. The training schedule was the same as before: 16 trials / day, until attainment of learning criterion (second day when 8 consecutive correct responses have been performed).Open field and marble buryingMale mice were placed individually in the center of a square open field arena (50 × 50 × 30 cm) made of grey plastic for 7 minutes. Velocity (cm/sec) was analyzed using EthoVision10 system (Noldus). The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials. For the marble burying test, animals were placed in a standard Type II cage with 5 cm bedding containing 20 identical black marbles distributed equally for 30 minutes. A marble was considered buried if at least 2/3 of the marble was covered.ElectrophysiologyMale mice (P28-P34) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (4% in O2, Vapor, Draeger) prior decapitation and brain isolation. Acute horizontal brain slices (250 μm thick) from the midbrain were cut with a vibrating microslicer (Leica VT1200S) in ice-cold oxygenated sucrose-based cutting solution containing: NaCl (87 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM) sucrose (75 mM), CaCl2 (0.5), MgCl2 (7mM) and glucose (10 mM) (equilibrated with 95% O2/ 5% CO2). Slices were immediately transferred to a storage chamber containing artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) containing: NaCl (125 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), MgCl2 (2 mM), CaCl2 (2.5 mM) and glucose (11 mM), pH 7.4, constantly bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2; 315-320 mOsm. Slices were maintained at 35°C in ACSF for 60 min and then kept at room temperature before their transfer to the recording chamber. During the recordings, the slices were continuously perfused with ACSF at 35.0 ± 2.0°C throughout the experiments. Neurons were visualized with a LNScope (Luigs & Neumann, Germany) equipped with an oblique illumination condenser, a 60× objective (LUMPplanFI, NA 0.9) and a reflected illuminator (Olympus). Slices were illuminated with a collimated LED infrared light source (Thorlabs) and wLS LED illumination unit (Q-imaging). The recorded neurons in the VTA were identified by their anatomical localization and recorded if they were labeled with red retrobeads (or by morphology for recording from non-retrobead labelled cells). Their dopaminergic identity was subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Neuronal activity was recorded at the somata with borosilicate glass pipettes (4-6 MΩ) filled with an intracellular solution containing: K-gluconate (125 mM), KCl (20 mM), HEPES (10 mM), EGTA (10 mM), MgCl2 (2 mM), Na2ATP (2 mM), Na2-phosphocreatine (1 mM), Na3GTP (0.3 mM), 0.2% biocytin, pH 7.2 (with KOH); 312.3 mOsm. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and digitized at 10 kHz. Recording of spontaneous firing activity in VTA in dopaminergic neurons was achieved in voltage clamp cell-attached configuration after formation of a gigaseal.Baseline activity was recorded during 2 or 3 minutes (sweeps of 5 second duration were acquired every 10 seconds) before Oxytocin (1 μM; TOCRIS, # 1910) applied to the perfusion reached the recording chamber. Recordings in the presence of Oxytocin were continued for 3 minutes. At the end of these recordings, a whole-cell configuration in voltage clamp (holding potential: −55 mV) was achieved by disruption of the gigaseal with gentle negative pressure applied through the recording pipette. A period of 5 minutes was then allowed for loading the neurons with biocytin. Finally, the recording pipette was carefully removed and the slice transferred to paraformaldehyde (4 % in PBS) for subsequent anatomical analysis. All TH+ cells, including cells negative for retrobeads, were used to analyze frequency. Only TH+ and retrobead positive cells recorded for a minimum of 3 min after OXT application were used to analyze OXT response, and all data points represent an average per minute.Ih recordings were performed in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration after compensating the pipette capacitance and the series resistance (Rs) (15-20 MΩ; 40-50%, bandwidth 3.5 kHz). Rs was monitored on-line and the experiments were discarded if the Rs changed >20%.Neuronal input resistances (Ri) and membrane capacitances were evaluated for each neuron by injecting a voltage command of −5 mV for 200 ms duration, from a holding potential (HP) of −50 mV. The electrical capacitance of the neurons was determined by fitting a bi-exponential function to the capacitive current at the beginning of a −50 mV pulse from a holding potential of −55 mV (pipette capaciantce was previously compensated during the cell-attached configuration prior whole-cell formation). The amplitude-weighted time constant (□vc) and measured current peak (Ipeak) amplitude was inserted into the following formula to calculate the electrical capacitance. C[pF]=weightedτvc[ms]∗Ipeak[pA]5[mV] Weighted t_vc was calculated from the the bi-exponential fitting as: τvc=A1∗τ1+A2∗τ2A1+A2 Ih was evoked by injecting a series of 1.5 sec duration hyperpolarizing voltage commands (Vcomm) from a HP of −50 mV to −130 mV, in consecutive steps of 10 mV. Ih-tail currents were evoked at 130 mV at the end of each Vcomm before returning the HP to −50 mV. Ih-tail voltage dependency was calculated by plotting their normalized amplitudes. Maximal Ih-tail currents (Imax) as defined as recorded after the Vcomm to −130 mV, was set to 1; Minimal Ih-tail currents (Imin) as recorded after the HP of −50 mV, was set to 0. A Boltzmann function was fitted: I = Imin + (Imax − Imin) / 1 + exp [(V50 − Vcomm)/s]; where V50 is the half-activation potential and s is the slope factor. After recording the Ih, each cell was switched to current clamp mode to record the resting membrane potential. The experimenter was blinded to the genotype and treatment condition.Analysis of mRNA translationTranslational in the VTA was analyzed using FUNCAT55,56, where AHA is incorporated into cells and then detected using an alkyne tagged to Alexa 488. Mice were anesthetized at P28 and 250 μm thick coronal slices were cut on a vibratome and placed in ACSF for 45 min at 35°C to recover. The same cutting solution and ACSF as described for electrophysiology was used. Slices were moved to an incubation chamber and incubated for an additional 3h with 1mM AHA (Jena Bioscience, CLK-AA005). At the end of incubation, slices were transferred to ice-cold 4% PFA and left overnight at 4°C. Next day, slices were incubated for 1.5h in a blocking solution containing 5% BSA (Sigma), 5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Trition X-100 in 1× PBS at agitation at RT. Slices were then washed 3× 5 min followed by incubation over night with gentle agitation with 500 μl Click-iT reaction cocktail according to the manual instructions (Click-iT Cell Reaction Buffer Kit, Invirogen, C10269). Slices were then washed 3× 10 min with 1xPBS followed by incubation with anti-TH (Millipor, AB1542, 1:1000) primary antibody at RT for 2h, washed three times in 1× PBS, followed by incubation for 2h at room temperature with a secondary antibody. The sections were then washed three times in 1× PBS before mounted onto microscope slides with ProLong Gold antifade (Invitrogen, p36930). Images were taken on an Olympus SpinSR spinning disk with a UPL S APO 30× objective (NA 1.5). All images were taken with the same laser power, gain and exposure settings, and analyzed using ImageJ. For analysis of AHA incorporation, 10 images were taken of the VTA and the Alexa-488 mean fluorescent intensity of 9-20 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to TH+ somas were measured. The mean fluorescent intensity of cells per image was used for analysis, and the experimenter was blinded to genotype and treatment. All images within each experiment were processed in parallel using identical settings in ImageJ (NIH) and Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0 (Adobe systems).For puromycin incorporation, 400 μm thick coronal slices were cut on a vibratome and placed in ACSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 20 Glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 95% O2/5% CO2) for 30 min at RT followed by 2h at 32°C. 5 μg/ul puromycin (Sigma) was added for 45 min to label newly synthesized proteins. Sections were snap frozen and subsequently lysed in 10mM Hepes, 1% SDS, 1mM NaF, 1mM NaVO4 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science), sonicated and incubated for 10min at 95°C. Puromycin incorporation was measured by western blot (see ‘Western blot’ for detailed methods) using mouse anti-puromycin antibody (EQ0001, Kerafast). The results were normalized to signal obtained with anti-calnexin antibodies run at the same time on a different blot.Western blot and AlphaLISA immunoassayCortical neurons and brain tissue were homogenized in lysis buffer containing NaCl 137 mM, KCl, 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4 10 mM, KH2PO4, 1.8 mM, EDTA 5 mM, Triton 1%, and complete protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting was done with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate. The following primary antibody was used in this study: p-eIF4E (Abcam, ab76256 1:1000), eIF4E (Abcam, ab47482 1:1000), p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, 4370S 1:1000), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, 4695S 1:1000), p-eIF4G (Cell Signaling, 2441S 1:1000), eIF4G (Cell Signaling, 2498 1:1000), p-MNK1 (Cell Signaling, 2111, 1:1000), MNK1 (Cell Signaling, 2195S, 1:1000), GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 5174 1:2000) and calnexin (Stressgen, SPA-865 1:2000). Loading controls were run on the same gel, and for some experiments Mini PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™ Gels (Bio-Rad) were used as loading controls. Signals were acquired using an image analyzer (Bio-Rad, ChemiDoc MP Imaging System) and images were analyzed and prepared using ImageJ.For additional measurements of eIF4E phosphorylation state, the AlphaLISA SureFire Ultra p-eIF4E (Ser209) Assay Kits (PerkinElmer) were used according to the manufactures protocol. AlphaLISA signals were measured using a Tecan SPARK plate reader on recommended settings.Immunohistochemistry and imagingAnimals were transcardially perfused with fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 100mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at P26-P32. Brains were post-fixed overnight at 4°C, incubated in 30% sucrose in 1xPBS for 48h, and snap frozen on dry ice. Tissues were sectioned at 35 μm on a cryostat (Microm HM650, Thermo Scientific). Floating sections were kept in 1×PBS before incubation with blocking solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× TBS and 10% normal donkey serum. The slices were incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight and washed three times in 1× TBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by incubation for 2 hours at room temperature with a secondary antibody. The sections were washed three times in 1× TBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 before mounted onto microscope slides with ProLong Gold antifade (Invitrogen, p36930). For post-hoc confirmation of TH positive cells after electrophysiology, the sections were fixed in the same fixative as described above, washed 3× with 1× PBS before blocking and incubation with anti-TH antibody using same method as above. The following primary antibodies were used for this study: sheep anti-TH (Millipor, AB1542, 1:1000) and mouse-anti neurophysin-1 (Millipore, MABN844, 1:2000). Secondary antibodies used were: donkey anti-sheep IgG-Cy3 (713-165-147), donkey anti-sheep Cy5 (713-175-147), donkey anti-rabbit IgG Cy3 (711-165-152), goat anti-mouse Cy2 (714-225-150) all from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Streptavidin DyLight 488 (Thermo Scientific #21832, 1mg/ml), was used to visualize biocytin. Hoechst dye was co-applied with the secondary antibody at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Images were acquired on a custom-made dual spinning disk microscope (Life Imaging Services GmbH, Basel Switzerland) using 10× and 40× objectives. Images were taken bilaterally along the whole VTA and PVN dorso-ventral axis and images from at least 4 (VTA) or 5 (PVN) planes were analyzed. OXT+ cells in the PVN were counted manually. Neurophysin-1 area coverage and puncta intensity was measured using the particle measurement tool in ImageJ on sum projections. All images within each experiment were processed in parallel with identical settings using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0 (Adobe systems).Fluorescent in situ hybridizationMice were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation. Brains were quickly removed and snap frozen on dry ice prior to storage at −80°C. Brains were cut on a cryostat into 10 μm sections, adhered to Superfrost ultra plus slides (Thermo Scientific) and stored at −80°C. Sections were fixed for 30 min in 4% PFA before being processed using the RNAscope® Fluorescent Multiplex Kit (ACD) according to the manufacturers instruction. The following probes were used: oxtr (C3 #412171), v1ar (C3 # 418061), th (Slc6a3-C2, #315441) and nlgn3 (C1 #497661). Probes were combined as oxtr/th/nlgn3 or v1ar/th/nlgn3. Amp-4-Alt B were used for all combinations. Sections were imaged on a custom-made dual spinning disk microscope (Life Imaging Services GmbH, Basel Switzerland) using 40× objective, with 12 section z-stacks with 0.2 um in-between z sections. Images were processed in ImageJ by doing sum projection of the z-stacks, followed by analysis of fluorescent intensity and number of puncta. Cell types were identified based on the presence of th and DAPI. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the cell to define the area using DAPI, and only cells with no adjacent DAPI staining was used to avoid false positives from signals from a second cell. Dots in the ROI were manually counted and fluorescent intensity was analyzed using ImageJ. Images were assembled with identical settings using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0 (Adobe systems).Cell cultureCortical cultures were prepared from E16.5 mouse embryos. Neocortices were dissociated by addition of papain (130 units, Worthington Biochemical LK003176) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in neurobasal medium (Gibco 21103-049) containing 2% B27 supplement (Gibco 17504-044), 1% Glutamax (Gibco 35050-038), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma P4333). At DIV14, the cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or different doses of ETC-168 for 3 hours before harvesting for western blot.Proteomic analysisVTA tissue was microdissected from coronal sections using anatomical landmarks. Dissected tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Successful recovery of proteins from dopaminergic neurons was confirmed by quantitative assessment of enrichment of dopaminergic markers (dopamine transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine decarboxylase) as compared to other brain regions (Extended data Fig.4a).Sample preparation for LC-MS analysisTissue was washed twice with PBS and dissolved in 50 μl lysis buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1M ammoniumbicarbonate), reduced with 5mM TCEP for 15 min at 95°C and alkylated with 10mM chloroacetamide for 30min at 37°C. Samples were digested with trypsin (Promega) at 37°C overnight (protein to trypsin ratio: 50:1). To each peptide samples an aliquot of a heavy reference peptide mix containing 10 chemically synthesized proteotypic peptides (Spike-Tides, JPT, Berlin, Germany) was spiked into each sample at a concentration of 5 fmol of heavy reference peptides per 1μg of total endogenous protein mass. Then, the peptides were cleaned up using iST cartridges (PreOmics, Munich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were dried under vacuum and stored at −80 °C until further use.Targeted PRM-LC-MS analysis of protein isoformsIn a first step, parallel reaction-monitoring (PRM) assays57 were generated from a mixture containing 100 fmol of each heavy reference peptide and shotgun data-dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The setup of the μRPLC-MS system was as described previously (Pubmed-ID: 27345528). Chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out using an EASY nano-LC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a heated RP-HPLC column (75 μm × 30 cm) packed in-house with 1.9 μm C18 resin (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were analyzed per LC-MS/MS run using a linear gradient ranging from 95% solvent A (0.15% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 5% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.15% formic acid) to 45% solvent B over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each MS1 scan was followed by high-collision-dissociation (HCD) of the 10 most abundant precursor ions with dynamic exclusion for 20 seconds. Total cycle time was approximately 1 s. For MS1, 1e6 ions were accumulated in the Orbitrap cell over a maximum time of 100 ms and scanned at a resolution of 120,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). MS2 scans were acquired at a target setting of 1e5 ions, accumulation time of 50 ms and a resolution of 30,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. The normalized collision energy was set to 30%, the mass isolation window was set to 1.4 m/z and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum.The acquired raw-files were database searched against a mouse database (Uniprot, download date: 2017/04/18, total of 34,490 entries) by the MaxQuant software (Version 1.0.13.13). The search criteria were set as following: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues); 3 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; Arg10 (R), Lys8 (K) and oxidation (M) as variable modification. The mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. The best 6 transitions for each peptide were selected automatically using an in-house software tool and imported to Skyline (version 4.1 (https://brendanx-uw1.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view). A mass isolation lists containing all selected peptide ion masses were exported form Skyline, split into 8 mass lists by charge, c-terminal amino acid and transition and precursor ions. The mass lists were then imported into the Lumos operating software for SureQuant analysis using the following settings: The resolution of the orbitrap was set to 30k (120k) FWHM (at 200 m/z) for heavy (light) peptide ions and the fill time was set to 54 (246) ms, respectively, to reach a target value of 1e6 ions. Ion isolation window was set to 0.4 Th and the scan range was set to 150-1500 Th. The mass window for triggering heavy PRM scans was set to 10 ppm and the depended PRM triggering threshold for the light channel was set to a minimum of 2 detected transitions. A MS1 scan using the same conditions are for DDA was included in each MS cycle. Each condition was analyzed in biological quadruplicates or quintuplicates. All raw-files were imported into Skyline for protein / peptide quantification. To control for variation in sample amounts, the total ion chromatogram (only comprising peptide ions with two or more charges) of each sample was determined by Progenesis QI (version 2.0, Waters) and used for normalization. A summary of the peptides used is displayed in Supplementary Table 1.Global Proteome analysis using shotgun proteomics1 μg of peptides of each sample were subjected to LC–MS analysis using a using a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer connected to an electrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) as recently specified58 and a custom-made column heater set to 60°C. In brief, peptide separation was carried out using an EASY nLC-1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a RP-HPLC column (75μm × 30cm) packed in-house with C18 resin (ReproSil-Pur C18–AQ, 1.9μm resin; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) using a linear gradient from 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 5% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 45% solvent B over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.2μl/min. 3x106 and 105 ions were accumulated for MS1 and MS2, respectively, and scanned at a resolution of 60,000 and 15,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). Fill time was set to 110 ms for MS1 and 50 ms for MS2 scans. For MS2, a normalized collision energy of 28% was employed, the ion isolation window was set to 1.4 Th and the first mass was fixed to 100 Th. To determine changes in protein expressions across samples, a MS1 based label-free quantification was carried out. Therefore, the generated raw files were imported into the Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Version 2.0) and analyzed using the default parameter settings. MS/MS-data were exported directly from Progenesis QI in mgf format and searched against a decoy database of the forward and reverse sequences of the predicted proteome from mus musculus (Uniprot, download date: 2017/04/18, total of 34,490 entries) using MASCOT (version 2.4.1). The search criteria were set as following: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues); 3 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; oxidation (M) as variable modification. The mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. Results from the database search were imported into Progenesis QI and the final peptide measurement list containing the peak areas of all identified peptides, respectively, was exported. This list was further processed and statically analyzed using our in-house developed SafeQuant R script (SafeQuant, https://github.com/eahrne/SafeQuant 58). The peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% using the number of reverse hits in the dataset. All quantitative analyses were performed in biological quintuplicates. Proteins with less than 1 peptide were excluded from the analysis.The results details of the proteomics experiments carried out including identification scores, number of peptides quantified, normalized (by sum of all peak intensities) peak intensities, log2 ratios, coefficients of variations and p-values for each quantified protein. A summary is displayed in Supplementary table 2.Global Proteome analysis using tandem mass tagsSample aliquots (prepared as described above) containing 10 μg of peptides were dried and labeled with tandem mass isobaric tags (TMTpro 16-plex, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To control for ratio distortion during quantification, a peptide calibration mixture consisting of six digested standard proteins mixed in different amounts were added to each sample before TMT labeling as recently described58. After pooling the differentially TMT labeled peptide samples, peptides were again desalted on C18 reversed-phase spin columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Macrospin, Harvard Apparatus) and dried under vacuum. TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-pH reversed phase separation using a XBridge Peptide BEH C18 column (3,5 μm, 130 Å, 1 mm × 150 mm, Waters) on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system. Peptides were loaded on column in buffer A (ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) in water) and eluted using a two-step linear gradient starting from 2% to 10% in 5 minutes and then to 50% (v/v) buffer B (90% acetonitrile / 10% ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) over 55 minutes at a flow rate of 42 μl/min. Elution of peptides was monitored with a UV detector (215 nm, 254 nm). A total of 36 fractions were collected, pooled into 12 fractions using a post-concatenation strategy as previously described59, dried under vacuum.1μg of peptides were LC-MS analyzed as described previously58. Chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out using an EASY nano-LC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a heated RP-HPLC column (75 μm × 37 cm) packed in-house with 1.9 μm C18 resin (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch). Aliquots of 1 μg total peptides were analyzed per LC-MS/MS run using a linear gradient ranging from 95% solvent A (0.15% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 5% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.15% formic acid) to 30% solvent B over 90 minutes at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each MS1 scan was followed by high-collision-dissociation (HCD) of the 10 most abundant precursor ions with dynamic exclusion for 20 seconds. Total cycle time was approximately 1 s. For MS1, 3e6 ions were accumulated in the Orbitrap cell over a maximum time of 100 ms and scanned at a resolution of 120,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). MS2 scans were acquired at a target setting of 1e5 ions, accumulation time of 100 ms and a resolution of 30,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. The normalized collision energy was set to 35%, the mass isolation window was set to 1.1 m/z and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum.The acquired raw-files were searched against a protein database containing sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of mus musculus (www.ebi.ac.uk, release date 2019/03/27), the six calibration mix proteins58 and commonly observed contaminants (in total 17,412 sequences) using the SpectroMine software (Biognosys, version 1.0.20235.13.16424) and the TMT 16-plex default settings. In brief, the precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), 3 missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation (C), TMTpro (K and peptide n-terminus) were set as fixed modification and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. The false identification rate was set to 1% by the software based on the number of decoy hits. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. Acquired reporter ion intensities in the experiments were employed for automated quantification and statically analysis using a modified version of our in-house developed SafeQuant R script (v2.3, ref.58). This analysis included adjustment of reporter ion intensities, global data normalization by equalizing the total reporter ion intensity across all channels, summation of reporter ion intensities per protein and channel, calculation of protein abundance ratios and testing for differential abundance using empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics. Finally, the calculated p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini−Hochberg method. A summary is displayed in Supplementary Table 3.Raw MS data associated with the manuscript have been deposited in to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE60 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD018808 and 10.6019/PXD018808.Gene ontology, network and gene set enrichment analysisGene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using DAVID classification system (https://david.ncifcrf.gov). Proteins significantly different between vehicle treated wild type and Nlgn3 KO (P<0.05) were compared to all proteins detected in the proteomic screen using the GO GOTERM_BP_DIRECT annotation data set with minimum number of hits set to 5 and maximum P-value threshold to 0.05 with Benjamini correction (P<0.05). Network analysis was obtained using String v11 database61. Each node represents a protein altered in Nlgn3KO VTA compared to wild type VTA in vehicle treated conditions, and each edge show protein-protein interaction as determined by experiments and databases. The highest confidence (0.900) was used for interaction scores. Disconnected nodes and networks containing >6 proteins were removed. Gene set enrichment analysis for TMT proteomic data was performed using all proteins detected with at least 2 peptides with PSEA-Quant45. The list of GO terms with a Q-value of Q<0.01 were summarized using REVIGO62 with small (0.5) allowed similarity, and displayed using Cytoscape.Statistical analysisThe animals were randomly assigned to each group the moment of drug treatment, and minimum 3 independent cohorts were used for behavioral experiments. Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism 8 (San Diego, CA, USA). The normality of sample distributions was assessed and when violated non-parametrical tests were used. When normally distributed, the data were analyzed with unpaired t-test for comparison between two groups, while for multiple comparisons one-way ANOVA and repeated measures (RM) ANOVA were used. For the analysis of variance with 2 factors (two-way ANOVA, RM two-way ANOVA and RM two-way ANOVA by both factors), normality of sample distribution was assumed, and followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Differences in frequency distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All the statistical tests adopted were two-sided. When comparing two samples distributions similarity of variances was assumed, therefore no corrections were adopted. Outliers were identified using ROUTS test on the most stringent setting (Q=0.1%). Data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. and the significance was set at P<0.05.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7116741.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Biochemical Assays for MTase Activity","text":"Biochemical Assays for MTase Activity\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

PBMC were separated using a Ficoll separation gradient. Following centrifugation, the PBMC layer was extracted and washed twice using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). CD8+ T cells were isolated via negative selection using Stem Cell Magnetic Bead Separation Kit (17953, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Cell culture and activationCells were activated using Immunocult Human CD3/CD28/CD2 T Cell Activator (Stem Cell Technologies, #10970) and cultured in RPMI 1640 media (RPMI 1640 ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) and an antibiotic cocktail of 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). On day three post activation, cells were washed in PBS and cultured in complete RPMI media supplemented with 200 U/mL recombinant human IL-2 (#100-02, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Primary cells were cultured for up to 20 days post activation, checked daily for cell count, and kept at a concentration between 1 and 2 × 106 cells/mL. Jurkat T cells (ATCC clone E6.1) were maintained in the above media conditions as well without supplemental IL-2.siRNA transfectionCells were transfected with 250–500 pmol TIM-3 siRNA (ThermoFisher Scientific, 4392420), CEACAM1 siRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA) or nonspecific siRNA scramble control (Thermo Fisher, 12935300) (see Supplemental Table 1 for siRNA sequences) using a P3 kit for the Amaxa 4D Nucleofector (Lonza). All cells were assessed for knockdown efficiency by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry or western blotting on days 3–4 post-transfection. Freshly isolated T cells were transfected immediately post negative selection, allowed to rest for 30 min, and activated with Immunocult (Stem Cell Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Late-stage T cells (days 10–14 post-activation) were transfected on day 10 and assessed for knockdown efficiency on day 13 post-activation.Pharmacological InhibitorsCells were treated with 1 µM AKT inhibitor AZK5363 (S8019) or 1 µM PI3K inhibitor BKM120 (S2247), Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX), or DMSO solvent control for 1 h prior to restimulation with 100 ng/mL OKT3. Cells were assessed for death 24 h later via propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as detailed below.Cloning and cell transfectionsTIM-3 and CEACAM1 DNA constructs were purchased from Addgene (49212, Watertown, MA) and Origene (RC221096, Rockville, MD), respectively. Open reading frames were cloned into the pUNO expression vector using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), including a C-terminal FLAG tag. Purified plasmids (10 µg per cuvette) were transfected into Jurkat T cells using a ECM630 electroporator (Harvard Apparatus BTX, Holliston, MA) at 260 V, 950 mF as previously described78. Expression of proteins was assessed by flow cytometry or western blot.RICD assaysPrimary effector T cells in RPMI were aliquoted into 96 well plates at 1 × 106 cells/mL and restimulated with anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (#05121-05, Bio-gems, Westlake Village, CA). Unless otherwise stated, all experiments performed per independent blood sample were completed with three technical replicates. All restimulation experiments were performed using 100 ng/mL of OKT3 unless otherwise stated. For death assessment, cells were cultured for 24 h in OKT3 and assessed for apoptosis 24 h later using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (see below). For newly activated cells, cells were restimulated on day 4 post-activation; late-stage cells were restimulated on day 13 post-activation.Flow cytometryGeneral flow cytometry protocolT cells were spun in polypropylene round-bottom tubes and placed in 100 µL of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide, 1% FBS). Tubes were stained with antibodies, vortexed briefly and placed on ice in the dark for 30 min. Following antibody binding, tubes were washed twice with 2 mL FACS buffer and spun down. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, cells were resuspended in 300 µL FACS buffer and immediately analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). TIM-3 surface staining was performed using PE-conjugated anti-TIM-3 antibody (clone F38-2E2, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) at 5 µL/test; CEACAM1 surface staining was performed using unconjugated anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (clone 283340, ThermoFisher Scientific) with secondary antibody (Biolegend, 406715), both at 2 µL/test. APC-conjugated anti-CD3 (100236), PE-conjugated anti-CD25 (356104), and PE-conjugated anti-FASL (306407) antibodies were used at 5 µL/test (Biolegend). TIM-3 ligands were assessed as follows: anti-Gal-9 antibody (clone 9M1-3, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) at 5 µL/test; anti-PS antibody (Apotracker Green, Biolegend, San Diego, CA).Time course assessmentCells were assessed on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 following activation for TIM-3 (clone F38-2E2, 345006) at 5 µL/test.Propidium iodide stainingFollowing overnight restimulation, cells were collected from the 96-well plate and placed into 0.3 ml polypropylene tubes. Ten microlitre of propidium iodide (PI) (Millipore Sigma, P4864) at 1 µg/mL stock solution was added to each tube. Cells were immediately assessed for apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis on the BD Accuri C6.Flow cytometric softwareAll flow cytometric analyses were performed using Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer built-in software and FlowJo (Becton Dickinson).Addition of blocking antibodies and recombinant proteinsTo disrupt TIM-3 ligand association, primary effector T cells were cultured with 10 µg/mL TIM-3 blocking monoclonal antibody (clone F38-2E2, Biolegend, 345004), Recombinant Human TIM-3-FC Chimera (R&D Systems, 2365-TM-050), or 10 µg/mL Mouse IgG1 Isotype Control SAFIRE (Bio-gems, 44212-25) for 1 h prior to restimulation with OKT3. CEACAM1, CEACAM3 and CEACAM-8 Fc-chimera proteins were generated from plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Esther Klaile (University of Jena, Germany) as previously described79, and were used at a concentrations between 1 and 100 µg/mL in primary cell solution for 1 h prior to restimulation with OKT3, as noted in the text. CEACAMx-Fc plasmids were originally synthesized in the labs of Esther Klaile and Bernard Singer.Calculation of RICDRICD sensitivity was calculated as previously described80. Propidium iodide-negative cells (viable) were counted for each sample under a fixed rate of fluidics and time of collection on the AccurI C6 Flow Cytometer. The following formula was used to calculate percentage cell loss: [% Cell Loss = ((Control − Restim)/Control)*100], for which the Control equaled the total number of untreated viable cells, and Restim equaled the total number of viable cells following restimulation with OKT3. Triplicate wells were averaged prior to assessment.Immunoblotting and densitometry analysisImmunoblottingCells in each condition were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM NaF), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma, 11836153001) and PhosStop Phosphatase Inhibitors (Sigma, 4906837001). Cell lysates were mixed with in a 1:1 ratio of Laemmli buffer supplemented with 50 µM βME and heated at 95 °C for five minutes for denaturation. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% gradient acrylamide gel (456–1095, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 110 V for 90 min for optimal band separation. Gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane via semi-wet transfer (TurboBlot tranfer system, Bio-Rad). The following primary antibodies were used at dilutions in Odyssey blocking buffer TBS (927-50000, LiCOR, Lincoln, NE) according to manufacturer’s protocol: TIM-3 XP monoclonal antibody (clone D5D5R, Cell Signaling Technology, 45208S), 4G10 Platinum Anti-Phosphotyrosine Antibody (Millipore Sigma, 2859168), BIM/BOD polyclonal antibody (ADI-AAP-330E, Enzo, Farmingdale, NY), FasL monoclonal antibody (clone: Ab3, EMD Biosciences, Millipore Sigma), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F1804-200UG), β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, A1978). Licor IRDye secondary antibodies used at 1:10,000 dilution. All immunoblot images were visualized using an Odyssey CLx instrument (LiCOR) and assessed for densitometry using Image Studio Lite Software. To calculate densitometry, total band signal density was assessed in comparison to total β-actin signal density for normalization.Quantitative real-time PCRCells in each condition were prepared for RNA isolation according to manufacturer’s instructions (kit #11-331, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). RNA was resuspended in nuclease free water at a concentration of approximately 50–100 ng/µL per sample. RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using 50–100 ng RNA total, using the iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, 1725038). qRT-PCR was performed using the SSO Advanced SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix and manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad, 1725271); qRT-PCR was performed on Bio-Rad CFX96. Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1. All samples’ Ct values were normalized to 18S Ribosomal RNA.Confocal microscopySlide preparationApproximately, 30–100 × 103 cells were placed onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in PBS. All cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (EMS). Cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently washed with PBS. Cells were blocked using a 1% FBS/PBS mix for 30 min, followed by another PBS wash. Primary TIM-3 antibody (clone F38.2E2, Biolegend, 345004) was prepared in 1% PBS/FBS at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and allowed to bind to cells for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS/FBS solution. AlexaFluor-647 anti-IgG2b secondary antibody (Biolegend, 406715) was prepared in 1% PBS/FBS at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and allowed to bind for 30 min. Cells were washed again with PBS/FBS three times. Ten microlitre DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting medium (0100-20, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) was applied to the slides for DAPI staining and coverslip adhesion. All images were obtained on a Zeiss 700 confocal scanning microscope.Image processing/code availabilityMicroscopy analyses were conducted using ImageJ (Fiji) software version 1.53c. Image processing code can be found on Github using the following link: mad-scientist-in-training/Microscopy-code: A repository for the code used in ImageJ to process the images present in the publication “TIM-3 drives temporal differences in RICD Sensitivity in conjunction with CEACAM1 in effector T lymphocytes” (github.com).Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed and visualized using Prism software version 8.4.3 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Bar graph heights represent sample means, and all error bars indicate the standard deviation within the samples. For specific statistical tests, please reference the figure legends. All tests in which data was transformed significantly (including qPCR results and fold change values) were analyzed using the non-parametric equivalent of the appropriate statistical test to minimize type I error. All statistical tests were run two-sided. All p values < 0.05 were considered significant.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC8046753.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"cAMP Accumulation Assays Using the AlphaScreen® Kit (PerkinElmer)","text":"cAMP Accumulation Assays Using the AlphaScreen® Kit (PerkinElmer)\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Recommended density for CHO FlpIN cells is 30,000 cells/well.# B.  Stimulation1.  The day following seeding, aspirate nutrient media and replace with 90~ul pre-warmed Stimulation buffer.2.  Incubate in a humidified environment at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 30m i n . Note: Do not leave in cells in Stimulation buffer for longer than 2 h prior to stimulation.3.  Prepare serial dilutions of ligands at 10x final concentration in Stimulation buffer, enough for 10ul/u ell , to be performed in duplicate (minimum). Note: Concentration range to use will depend on ligand affinity for receptor. For initial tests, select a top concentration 100x Kd of ligand, a buffer only control, and several concentrations between these. The range can then be refined in subsequent experiments.4.  Prepare 10× appropriate concentration of forskolin in Stimulation buffer. Note: This is the internal control for the experiment – forskolin is an activator of adenylate cyclase, enhancing the formation of cAMP. Recommended final concentration of forskolin in a CHO FlpIN cell line is 100 μM.5.  Following 30 min incubation in stimulation buffer, add 10~ul of 10x prepared ligands tocells, for a total volume of 100ul , 1x final concentration. 6.  Incubate cells with ligand in a humidified environment at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 30 min. Note: Optimization for assay time will be necessary. Recommended initial stimulation is 30 min. 7.  After 30 min, rapidly remove ligand containing media from cells. Note: Depending on the cell type, this may involve flicking or gentle aspiration. 8.  Add 50 μl ice cold 100% ethanol to cells. 9.  Allow ethanol to evaporate at room temperature (RT) or in a 37^°C oven. Note: Ensure the ethanol is completely evaporated before proceeding to the next step. 10. Add 75 μl Lysis buffer. Note: Optimization for lysis volume will be necessary, and depends on the cell type, expression level of the receptor and efficiency of coupling to the cAMP pathway. Recommended starting lysis volume in a CHO FlpIN cell line is 75mu l. 11. Incubate lysates at RT for 5-10 min on an orbital shaker.# C.  Detection1.  In reduced lighting conditions, prepare detection reagents (Acceptor and Donor buffers).2.  Transfer 10ul of cell lysate to a 384-well OptiPlate.3.

Analyse luminescence on a Fusion-α or Envision plate reader using standard α-screen settings.# D.  Data analysis1.  Extrapolate data from the cAMP standard curve. Ideally, data should lie on the linear section of the cAMP standard curve.a.  If data falls off the bottom end of the curve (i.e., high concentration of cAMP), dilute lysates further with Lysis buffer and repeat detection component of protocol.b.  If data falls off the top end of the curve (i.e., low concentration of cAMP), assay should be performed again and cells lysed with a lower volume of Lysis buffer.2.  Normalize data to forskolin control.# Recipes1.

Tak1fl/fl, Tak1fl/flCd4Cre, Tbx21GFP (T-betGFP), Nr4a1GFP (Nur77GFP), Bcl2l11–/– (Bim–/–), Rag2GFP, Klf2GFP and B2m–/– mice were described previously8,9,24,40,41. IfngYFP, I-Ab–/–, Cd1–/–, Cd4CreERT2, Cd28–/– and Rosa26TdT (Jax 007914) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Il15–/– and KbDb–/– mice were obtained from Taconic. Rag2–/– mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and bred with B6.SJL mice to establish a CD45.1/2+ Rag2–/– line. For chimeras, lethally irradiated recipients were reconstituted with T cell depleted donor bone marrow cells and provided with neomycin- and proximicin B supplemented water for two weeks. Chimeras were analyzed minimum eight weeks after reconstitution. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University at Minnesota.IEL isolationIELs were isolated similarly to a previously published protocol42. Changes were made as follows: DTT was used instead of DTE and samples were placed into a 37 °C shaking incubator for 30 min for incubation with the DTT solution. Samples were resuspended in 40% percoll and overlayed onto 80% percoll and spun, and the interlayer was collected and labeled for flow cytometry.Flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions of indicated tissues were labeled with antibodies from eBioscience, Biolegend, Tonbo or R&D Systems. Clones: CD4 (RM4-5), CD8α (53-6.7), CD103 (M290), TCRβ (H57-597), CD44 (IM7), H-2Kb (AF6-88.5), CD5 (53-7.3), CD25 (PC61), PD-1 (J43), TCRγδ (GL3), CD122 (TM-b1), α4β7 (DATK32), NK1.1 (PK136), T-bet (4B10), Vα2 (B20.1), Vα3.2 (RR3-16), Vβ2 (B20.6), Vβ3 (KJ25), Vβ4 (KT4), Vβ5.1/5.2 (MR9-4), Vβ6 (PR4-7), Vβ9 (MR10-2), Ki-67 (16A8), CCR4 (2G12), CCR7 (4B12), CCR9 (CW-1.2), CXCR3 (CXCR3-173), CXCR4 (L276F12), CD69 (H1.2F3), Qa2 (69HI-9-9), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104). Biotinylated CD1d/PBS57 monomers were obtained from US National Institutes of Health tetramer facility and incubated with PE, APC or PE/Cy7 Streptavidin to fluorochrome-labeled multimers. Cells were stained for 20 min at 20 °C. When staining for CCR4 or CCR7, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For S1PR1 staining thymic samples were enriched for IELp by depletion of CD4+ cells (Miltenyi, manual MACS). Enriched cells were labeled with 10 μg Rat IgG2 anti-mS1PR1 (R&D Systems, clone 713412) per 1 × 106 cells for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then labeled with biotin anti-rat IgG (clone G28-5) for 20 min on ice and subsequently incubated with streaptavidin-fluorochrome. Before staining with other markers, the samples were blocked with 5% rat serum and 1% free streptavidin.SPADE analysisSpanning tree analysis was performed using the Cytobank Premium online platform (https://premium.cytobank.org/cytobank/) and according to previous publications18,19. Heatmaps were created with the Matrix2png version 1.2.1 online platform (http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png/).Adoptive transfer studiesPooled thymic single-cell suspensions were enriched for IELp by depletion of CD8+ and/or CD4+ cells by manual MACS (Miltenyi). IELp were then purified by flow cytometry. Within the live CD25–CD1dtet–TCRγδ–CCR7–CD4–CD8α– population CD5+TCRβ+ cells were divided and purified as CD122hiPD-1hi (type A) or CD122hiPD-1– (type B) IELp. Between 50,000 and 280,000 cells were transferred into recipients per i.v. injection. Total DN competitors were purified by MACS-depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells (Miltenyi).ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of Tbx21GFP thymi was described previously17. Briefly, thymi were incubated overnight in PBS containing PE labeled CD1d-tetramer loaded with PBS57 at 4 °C. Thymi were then washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h and snap frozen. 5 μm sections were blocked with PBS 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and goat serum (Jackson Laboratory) prior to staining. Clone RORg2 was used for RORγτ staining. Processing of Nr4a1GFP thymi up until rabbit anti-mouse β5t labeling with the primary antibody was performed as previously described13 with the exception of using 3 μm sections. Briefly, thymi were fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by immersion in 15% (wt/vol) sucrose in PBS overnight. Thymi were then frozen. For immunofluorescence, sections were treated with 0.1% Triton-X100/PBS (PBST) for 5 min at 20 °C and then incubated in PBS 3% BSA for 1 h at 20 °C prior to staining. For PD-1 staining, goat anti-mouse PD-1 (R&D Systems, cat. # AF1021) was added with the anti-β5t (MBL, cat. # PD021) for overnight labeling. Secondary antibody staining was done with AF647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. # 711-605-152) and AF555 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, cat. # A-21432) for 2 h at 20°C prior to DAPI staining. The Sections were then covered with a Prolong anti-fade mounting medium (Life Technologies) and images obtained 1 to 3 days later using a Leica DM6000B Epi-Fluorescent microscope.Histo-cytometryHisto-cytometry was performed as described previously17. The quantified values represent the frequencies after normalization to the total average cortical and medullary areas as previously described17.Intraveneous labeling of cells in the PVS1 μg PE-conjugated anti-CD45.2 antibody was injected intravenously per mouse and mice were euthanized for tissue collection 3-4 min after injections. Initially, perfused animals were compared to non-perfused ones. As no significant differences were observed, subsequent analysis was done on non-perfused mice. Labeled cells were isolated from single cell suspensions with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi) and manual MACS prior to further labeling for flow cytometry. Potential contamination of the labeled fraction by cells in circulation is negligible as indicated by reversed proportions of type A or -B like cells in blood (Fig. 5b), as well as the largely different proportions of various cell types (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d), and by different CD8SP/CD4SP or mature IELp/CD4SP ratios (Supplementary Fig. 4e) in the blood.FTY720 treatment25 μg FTY720 (Calbiochem) in PBS was injected intraperitoneally for six consecutive days and tissues were harvested on day seven. Mock- and untreated animals were used as controls.Ultrasound-guided intrathymic injections (RTE Assay)Intrathymic injections of 10–20 μl EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific) were performed as described previously43 and using the Vevo 2100 System. Two factors substantiated the accuracy of this method: First, the proportion of streptavidin+B220+ cells was less than 5% (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Second, when performed with Rag2GFP mice, over 90% of streptavidin+ TCRβ+ cells were GFP+ (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 5b) indicative of their recent thymic origin.Time-stamp labelingCd4CreERT2 mice were bred with Rosa26TdT mice. The offspring was injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) in sunflower oil 2% EtOH on one or two consecutive days. The thymus of tamoxifen recipients was analyzed on various days post injections.Statistical analysisPrism 5.0 and 6.0 were used for data analysis and arrangement. For comparison of two datasets, the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used. For comparison of 3 or more datasets, one way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was performed.

However, the observed stimulation of cell proliferation by these protein layers is usually fairly modest. This might be explained by their weak non-covalent association with the tissue culture plastic resulting in delamination and loss of immobilized protein molecules. Recently, it has been shown that the retention of ECM produced by the cells might be significantly increased by covalent immobilization of fibronectin to the plastic surface (Prewitz et al., 2013). However, ECM production is cumbersome and may be difficult to standardize. We have demonstrated that simple formaldehyde fixation under controlled conditions of layers formed by the selected individual ECM proteins can substantially enhance positive effects of these proteins on cell proliferation (Andreeva et al., 2016). Here we describe a detailed protocol of culture plastic coating and formaldehyde fixation for three individual components of ECM, namely fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen IV. Although we did not test the effects of controlled fixation with other protein constituents of the ECM, the positive results obtained with our protocol for three proteins of vastly differing molecular and biological properties provide sufficient reasons to assume the general applicability of the described procedure for enhancing proliferation stimulatory properties of a wider range of ECM proteins.","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2374"}}

For all treatments using inhibitors, inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, medium was changed, and fresh inhibitor was added every 24 h. The following inhibitors were used: PERKi GSK2606414 (MerckMillipore), used at 1 μM final concentration; DNA-PKcsi LY294002 (Ly, MerckMillipore), used at 1 μM final concentration; ATMi Ku-60019 (ATMi, SigmaAldrich), used at 10 μM final concentration; and PARPi Ku-0058948 (Ku; AxonMedChem) and Olaparib (Olap; Selleck Chemicals), both used at 1 μM final concentration. As positive control to induce ER stress/peIF2α/ATF4, cells were exposed for 3 h to 1 μM Thapsigargin (Sigma). To induce DNA double-strand breaks, cells were irradiated using a Faxitron Cabinet X-ray system Model RX-650 at the indicated IR doses.siRNA transfectionTransfections with siRNA purchased from Eurogentec or Thermo Fisher were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Cells were analysed at indicated time points after transfection. siRNA sequences used are listed in Additional file 9, Table S1.Analysis of cell growth in serum-restricted growth conditions106 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes 24 h prior to siRNA transfection in standard medium containing 15% FCS. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed and trypsinised with 1 ml trypsin solution, and trypsin was neutralised through addition of 2 ml of DMEM containing 5% FCS. One ml of the cell solution was distributed into each fresh 10-cm dish, containing 10 ml of medium with different concentrations of FCS (i.e. 15, 5, and 1%), and incubated another 72 h until analysis. Images of random fields were obtained with a phase-contrast microscope at ×10 magnification, and cells were collected for further analysis. For experiments involving pre-treatment of cells with H2O2 or IR, cells were grown in 10-cm dishes in standard medium containing 15% FCS for the duration of the pre-treatment. Pre-treatment was performed thrice every 24 h using the indicated doses of H2O2 or IR. For treatments with H2O2, the medium was changed every time. Twenty-four hours after the third round of pre-treatment, equal numbers of cells were seeded into different FCS-containing dishes as described above. To quantify the relative cell area from phase-contrast images, the area covered with cells was quantified after thresholding of images to remove the background using ImageJ software. For each experiment and data point, two to four independent fields were quantified, and mean values were calculated, which were then normalised to the respective control. Every experiment was independently repeated three to four times (n = 3 or 4), as indicated in the respective figure legends. Data are expressed as individual data points and mean ± SEM. Raw data can be found in Additional file 12 Table S4.qRT-PCRTotal RNA was purified using the RNeasy® Mini Kit by QIAGEN according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using the BioRad iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the LabCycler (SensoQuest). Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using the KAPA SYBR® FAST One-Step qRT-PCR Kit in a total volume of 10 μl in duplicates on the CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The comparative CT method was applied for quantification of gene expression, values were normalised against GAPDH and B2M and the control, and results were expressed as fold change in mRNA levels over control cells. Each experiment was independently repeated between two and four times as indicated in the figure legends, and data are expressed as individual data points and mean ± SD. Primers are detailed in Additional file 10 [54], Table S2, and were ordered from Microsynth. Raw data can be found in Additional file 12, Table S4.Flow cytometryFor cell cycle analysis by FACS, trypsinised cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 30 min at − 20 °C. To remove the fixation solution, cells were spun 5 min at 250 rcf at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μg/ml of DNase free RNase A (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and further stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Samples were run on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and the cell cycle distribution analysed using FlowJo V10.6.1. Each experiment was independently repeated three times. Data are mean ± SD of n = 3 independent experiments and are expressed as individual data points and mean ± SD. Analysis of apoptotic and necrotic cells was performed with the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Staining/Detection Kit (Abcam, ab14085) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells treated as indicated were washed and adherent cells trypsinised. Trypsin was neutralised using serum containing medium, and 500,000 cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl 1X Binding Buffer. Five μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl propidium iodide were added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min before acquisition with FACS as detailed above. Each experiment was independently repeated five times. Data are mean ± SD of n = 5 independent experiments and are expressed as individual data points and mean ± SD. Raw data can be found in Additional file 12 Table S4.Western blotFor Western blotting, unless otherwise stated, whole cell extracts that were prepared from cells grown in 15% FCS were used according to a procedure described previously [28]. 20 to 40 μg of total protein extract was separated on 4–20% Tris–Glycine gels (Novex) and transferred onto Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) according to standard procedures (Novex). Blots were probed with primary antibodies detailed in Additional file 11 Table S3, and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 and IRDye 800CW (both Li-cor Biosciences). Detection and quantification was performed using the Odyssey CLX image analysis system (Li-cor Biosciences). Tubulin or Histone H3 serves as the loading control. Each experiment was independently repeated three to five times. For quantification, protein levels were first normalised to the loading control and then to the respective control lane. Relative protein levels are indicated below the lanes and refer to the blot that is pictured.Alkaline comet assayThe alkaline comet assay was performed as described [8]. Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinisation, diluted to a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium, and embedded on a microscope slide in 1% low-melting agarose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Bio-Rad) that was settled on ice. Slides were lysed in buffer containing 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 10.5, 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. Slides were then incubated in the dark for 30 min in cold electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) DMSO, pH > 13) to allow DNA unwinding prior to electrophoresis at 21 V for 25 min in the comet assay tank from Trevigen. Neutralisation of the slides was performed with 0.5 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0). The slides were stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) and analysed using the Open Comet plugin for Fiji [55]. To quantify, a minimum of 50 cells were analysed per assay and condition, and the assay was repeated independently three to four (Fig. 4) times. All individual data points from all repeats and their mean ± SD are displayed.Neutral comet assayThe neutral comet assay was performed as described in [56]. Briefly, cell harvesting and embedding was performed as described for the alkaline comet assay. As positive control, cells were irradiated with 4 Gy IR 15 min prior to harvesting. Slides were lysed in buffer containing 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, and 1% N-laroylsarcosine, pH 9.5, with freshly added 1% (v/v) DMSO and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Slides were then washed 3 times in electrophoresis buffer (300 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3) and incubated for 1 h in fresh electrophoresis buffer. Electrophoresis was performed in fresh cold buffer for 1 h at 21 V (ca 120 mA) in the comet assay tank from Trevigen. Afterwards, slides were rinsed 3 times with dH2O, immediately stained using SYBR Gold (Invitrogen), and air dried. Analysis was performed using the Open Comet plugin for Fiji. For each data point, at least 50 cells were quantified per assay and condition, and mean values were calculated. The experiment was independently repeated 3–4 times. Data are mean ± SD of the mean values from these independent experiments, as indicated in the respective figure legends. Raw data can be found in Additional file 12, Table S4.ImmunofluorescenceCells were grown in 6-well plates on sterile 12-mm glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 8.0) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After one wash in PBS, permeabilisation was performed using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in DMEM with 10% FCS (53 bp1, rabbit, Abcam, 1:1000; γH2AX, mouse, Millipore, 1:1000; anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Scientific, 1:400; anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, Thermo Scientific, 1:400) and incubated 1–2 h at room temperature. DNA was stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 0.2 μg/ml). After 3 washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Molecular Probes) and imaged. Automated detection and quantification of foci in nuclei was performed using Fiji. The number of foci was quantified in a minimum of 100 nuclei per condition, with 2 independent repeats. All individual data points from all repeats and mean ± SD are displayed.Experimental design and statistical analysisThe exact sample size (n) for each experiment is indicated in the respective figure legends. All statistical analysis, calculation, and graphical display were performed with the programme GraphPad Prism (www.graphpad.com). Statistical testing of differences from 3 groups or more was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, while Student’s t test was applied when only two groups were compared. Significance levels are *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7106853.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Autophagy Assays (LC3B immunofluorescence, LC3B western blot, acridine orange assay)","text":"Autophagy Assays (LC3B immunofluorescence, LC3B western blot, acridine orange assay)\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 70% ethanol\n2.

Place one round coverslip per well in 24-well plate and add around 0.5:ml:70% ethanol for 1 min to sterilize the coverslip. Aspirate ethanol and let it dry for 5-10 m i n . Tissue cultured cells were plated on 24-well plate one day before experiment to let them attach to coverslips. (For cells to be plated on the coverslips, it depends on the time of drug treatment for your experiment so that the final cell confluency will be optimal for observation (80-90% )2.  On the day of experiment, treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired time.3.  Fix the cell by replace with 0.5ml cold 100% methanol (prestored in -20 ^°C_. ) and fix for 5 min. Since the cold methonal is prestored in -20~^°C and the fixation time is short, this step can be performed at RT on the bench. Cells can also be fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20-30 min followed by permeabilization with TBS-Tx for 20 min.4.  Wash coverslips with 0.5m PBS once and replace with 0.5m AbDil-Tx to block. The block step can range from room temperature 30 min to 4~^°C overnight. For example, people can use RT 30m i n , 1 h, 2 h or 4°0°2 h to overnight.5.  Prepare primary antibody. LC3B antibody from cell signaling can be diluted at 1/200-1/500 in AbDil-Tx. Usually one coverslip need 30-100~ul .6.  Transfer coverslips to the humid chamber. It can be made from a 15 cm round tissue culture plate. Cut a piece of square or rectangle parafilm that can fit the bottom of the plate. Use finger and tweezer to press down to make the parafilm adhere tightly to the bottom of the plate. The coverslips can then sit on the parafilm with liquid on top. Use a sheet of foil that can cover the lid of the plate to protect the coverslips from light. Incubating coverslips in this humid chamber will protect the coverslips from light in all steps. Use wet kimwipes to keep the humid chamber humid to prevent antibody evaporation.7.  Add diluted LC3B antibody onto the coverslips. Incubate at room temperature for -4 or at 4~^°C overnight. If incubate overnight, make sure to add at least 50~ul to each coverslip and wet the kimwipes in the humid chamber in case of antibody evaporation.8.  While  incubating,  prepare  secondary  antibodies  by  diluting  fluorescently  labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody into AdDil-Tx.9.  After incubation, wash LC3B antibody away by holding a transfer pipette filled with TBS-Txin one hand and a pipe that is attached to a liquid bottle and a vacuum pump to remove washing solution. Let TBS-Tx flow through the coverslips to wash the antibody away. Each coverslip needs to be washed 3 times with around ^2m of TBS-Tx each time.10. Add diluted secondary antibody onto coverslips and incubate at room temperature for around 1-2 h. After incubation, wash the coverslips in the same way as above.11. Take the mounting medium, ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI out of freezer around 10 minutes before the end of incubation to let it warm up to room temperature. Squeeze out a small drop (around 2-3ul ) of mounting medium onto the slide.12. Suck off the liquid on the coverslips as complete as possible and mound the coverslips onto the slide, on the top of ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium. Remember to keep the cell side down and keep them with direct contact with mounting medium.13. The ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium usually needs overnight to solidify and this step needs to be done at room temperature. Leave slides in a drawer or other space protected from light overnight to let it dry.14. When the slides are ready, take it to a fluorescent microscope to observe and take pictures (Figure 1).()Figure 1. LC3B immunofluorescence shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells. Hela cells were treated with indicated concentrations of Torin2 for 3 days stained antibody specific for LC3B and DAPI.# B. LC3B western blot1.  Tissue-culture cells are plated on 12-well plate (or 6-well plate) one day before experiment to let the cells attach to coverslips.2.  On the day of experiment, 10 u/ml of E64d/pepstatin A were added to cells one hour before to increase autophagy turnover. Different concentrations of small molecule compounds were then added to cells.3.  After desired time of incubation, wash cells once with PBS. Then lyse cells in lysis buffer by directly overlay 100-200ul lysis buffer (M-PER with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor) on the cells and incubate on ice (or 4^°C_. ) for 10-20 min .4.  At the end of incubation, collect cell lysate in a 1.5ml tube and spin 1 minute at max speed and 4^°C to remove cell debris.5.  Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, normalize, and add sample buffer. For drugs treated for a couple of hours, it’s usually not needed to normalize them since they normally don’t affect the cell numbers. However, for longer treatment (longer than a few hours), people should normalize the protein concentration across samples. Boil and load on a SDS-PAGE. Either a 15% SDS-PAGE or a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel id good for separating LC3B bands.6.  Transfer gel into a PVDF membrane as the standard western blot protocol.7.  Block the PVDF membrane in TBS-Tween (“TBS-T”) with 5% Non-fat dry milk for 1h at room temperature on a shaker.8.  Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare LC3B antibody by diluting it at 1/1small,000 into AbDil-Tw.9.  Incubate membrane in diluted LC3B at room temperature for ^2-3h or at 4^°C overnight.10. Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare HRP-conjugated secondary antibody by diluting it at 1/1,000 into AbDil-Tw.11. Incubate membrane in diluted secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour.12. Wash with TBS-T for 5 minutes, 3 times.13. Gently use paper towel to dry the membrane and place it face up and flat on a sheet of plastic wrap.14. Use prepared ECL to detect protein. Drain ECL and gently use paper towel and kimwipes to dry the membrane.15. Wrap up the membrane with plastic wrap.16. Either expose it to an X-ray film or use an imaging machine (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Western blot of LC3 shows that Torin2 induces apoptosis and autophagy in cells. Indicated cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of AZD8055 or Torin2 for 3 days before the cells and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-LC3B and anti-tubulin antibodies.C.  Acridine orange assay1.  Tissue cultured cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plate one day before as introduced in LC3B immunofluorescence.2.  One the day of experiment, cells are treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired amount of time before 1 u/ m I acridine orange was added for 15 min.3.  Cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde, washed with TBS-Tx before they are mounted in Prolong Gold with DAPI, which is the same as step A11 and A12.4.  Pictures were taken by a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3, left panel).5.  Total fluorescence of acridine orange in each frame was quantified using MetaMorph and divided by the total number of cells within the frame. Numbers are then normalized to DMSO-treated cells to show the acridine orange fold changes (Figure 3, right panel).()Figure 3. Acridine orange assay shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells.

All research participants were informed of the purpose and design of the study, and they provided written consent prior to participation. Exclusion criteria included: smoking, coronary disease, congestive heart failure, chronic inflammatory diseases, or orthopedic problems that could limit the ability to perform the exercise protocols. Participants were sedentary and were asked to maintain consistent dietary and lifestyle habits throughout the study. The cohort includes subjects with a wide range of insulin sensitivity (determined by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing, previously described38), age, BMI, and aerobic fitness (N = 23, Table 1). Using a small subset (N = 7) of this study cohort, we have previously reported that satellite cell and transcriptional responses to RE were modulated by EET37. In this cohort, we have also reported on satellite cell proliferation, muscle fiber hypertrophy (N = 23)39 and angiogenesis (N = 26)38 in response to EET. In this report, we investigate changes in M2 macrophage response to RE and the effects of EET on that response. We further assess relationships among fiber hypertrophy, muscle macrophages, and gene expression. Figure 1 provides an overview of the study design.Table 1Characteristics of study participants.VariableMean ± SEM (range) Immunohistochemstry using all four biopsy time points N = 14, 78% female Age49.5 ± 3.2 (29–68) BMI30.8 ± 1.3 (24.1–39.25) VO2 max27.5 ± 2.7 (13.8–53.2) SI3.26 ± 0.53 (0.92–6.81) Immunohistochemstry using baseline and post-EET biopsies N = 23, 78% female Age47.5 ± 2.7 (26–68) BMI30.8 ± 1.2 (23.3–41.8) VO2 max27.8 ± 2.0 (13.8–53.2) SI3.21 ± 0.42 (0.92–7.12) NanoString mRNA N = 20, 75% female Age49.8 ± 2.3 (29–64) BMI31.5 ± 1.2 (24.3–41.8) VO2 max27.1 ± 1.8 (13.8–53.2) SI3.04 ± 0.48 (0.65–7.12)Figure 1Overview of the study design. At baseline, subjects underwent a vastus lateralis biopsy, as well as a fitness assessment by graded exercise test for VO2max. Subjects next performed one bout of damaging RE, with a second muscle biopsy taken 3 days later. Subjects then underwent 12 weeks of EET on a cycle ergometer. Exercise intensity was gradually increased and rest periods were gradually decreased so that subjects exercised non-stop for 45 minutes at a heart rate corresponding to approximately 65% of VO2max throughout the training period. At the end of the EET protocol, VO2max was measured, and a third muscle biopsy was obtained 3 days after the final endurance bout. Participants performed one more bout of RE, with a fourth muscle biopsy obtained 3 days later.BiopsiesAt baseline, we obtained the first of four vastus lateralis biopsies using a 5 mm Bergstrom needle with suction. For immunohistochemistry, approximately 100 mg of each biopsy was mounted with fibers perpendicular to a cork using tragacanth gum and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. For isolation of primary myogenic precursor cells (MPCs), approximately 75 mg of tissue was placed in phosphate buffered saline with 1 g/L glucose and penicillin/streptomycin overnight prior to tissue dissociation. For gene expression, the remaining portion of each biopsy was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Graded exercise testingSubjects next performed maximal graded exercise testing (GXT), with assessment of VO2max and integrated electrocardiogram on a calibrated exercise bicycle ergometer. Subjects maintained a pedaling rate of 60–70 rpm, with a workload intensity beginning at 20 watts and increasing by 20 watts every 2 minutes until VO2max was achieved. Initial resistance was based on participant fitness. Continuous measures of oxygen consumption and CO2 production were obtained using the Vmax 229 system (Viasys Healthcare, Yorba Linda, CA). Respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of perceived exertion were recorded in the final 30 seconds of each work watts stage.Resistance exerciseSubjects performed an acute bout of RE using the leg contralateral to the baseline biopsy leg. RE consisted of 5 sets of 8 repetitions of leg extensions at 80% of 1 repetition max, with a sixth set performed to exhaustion. Seventy-two hours after RE, a second muscle biopsy was obtained from the exercised leg.Endurance exercise training (EET)Participants underwent 12 weeks of EET using a stationary cycle ergometer (Monark 828E Ergometer Upright Bike), and a target intensity corresponding to 65% of VO2max and approximately 75–80% of maximum heart rate, as determined by baseline maximal GXT measures. Training intensity was monitored using Polar A3 heart rate monitors (Polar Electro Inc., Woodbury, NY). Subjects were required to exercise three days/week for 45 minutes and were allowed to take intermittent breaks if they were unable to maintain constant exercise for the entire session. Throughout the training period, exercise intensity was gradually increased and rest periods were gradually decreased so that during the eighth through twelfth weeks of training, subjects were able to exercise for 45 minutes consecutively without rest at a heart rate corresponding to 65% of VO2max. Average power output per workout was calculated in excel [Power output = (work/time)/6.12].Following 12 weeks of EET, subjects underwent a third muscle biopsy. In order to detect chronic adaptations to EET, biopsy 3 was performed 72 hours after the last bout of exercise. Next, subjects repeated the RE protocol that was performed at the beginning of the study, and a fourth muscle biopsy was obtained 72 hours later.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)We performed IHC on vastus lateralis from 23 subjects, chosen based on the availability and quality of muscle mounts. All staining was performed on 7 µm sections of frozen muscle. Human muscle macrophage IHC has been described in detail and validated in our previous publication40. Primary macrophage antibodies include: mouse anti-human CD11b/CR3, clone Bear-1 (Cell Sciences, MON1019-1), mouse anti-human CD163 (Hycult Biotech, HM2157), and goat anti-Human MMR/CD206 (R&D, AF2534). Secondary antibodies include: biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-065-205) and biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Vector Laboratories, BA-5000). Thermo Scientific AlexaFlour systems were used to add fluorescent tags to secondary antibodies. IHC images were obtained using 20× magnification with a Zeiss AxioImager M1 upright microscope and analyzed using Zen Lite software (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Macrophages, fibers, and fiber size were analyzed manually. Macrophages were counted as M2 if they co-stained for CD11b and CD206. For M2 macrophage counting, the smallest section contained 123 cross-sectional fibers and the mean fiber number was 275 ± 15.9 SEM. M2c macrophages were identified by co-staining for CD206 and CD163. For M2c macrophage counting, the smallest section contained 91 cross-sectional fibers and the mean fiber number was 256 ± 22.3 SEM. Macrophage counts were normalized to fiber number. Muscle fiber size was assessed by quantifying cross sectional area (CSA) using IHC against laminin (Abcam, AB14055) to distinguish fiber borders. Satellite cell content was determined using IHC against Pax7 (DSHB), as described in our previous publication39.Human primary myotube culture, FN14 knock-down, and FN14 overexpressionHuman vastus lateralis tissue was finely minced in PBS with 1 g/L glucose, dispase II (2.4 U/ml; Roche Applied Science), and collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue was then incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes with gentle rotation, then passed through a 40 μm cell strainer. Cells were washed and pre-plated in in growth medium (HAM’s F-10, 20% fetal bovine serum and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor) to allow adherent cells (fibroblasts) to attach. Media containing non-adherent cells (MPCs) was gently moved to a fresh culture dish. MPCs were passaged in growth medium approximately 4 times, allowed to become approximately 90% confluent, then differentiated into myotubes in DMEM with 1 g/L glucose and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. On the fifth day of differentiation, cells were treated with 90 pM scramble RNA or small interfering RNA targeted against FN14 (siFN14) (Invitrogen Stealth RNAi siRNA, ThermoFisher), delivered using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty eight hours after siFN14 treatment, cells were harvested for RNA extraction. For FN14 overexpression, human myotubes were differentiated for 5 days, and then transfected with 500 ng/mL of pCMVScript control (vector) or pCMVScript encoding the full length human FN14 (FN14-FL)41. Myotubes were transfected for 24 hours using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (ThermoFisher), and then harvested for RNA.Gene expressionRNA extractionApproximately 30–40 mg of frozen vastus lateralis was homogenized in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany, 79306). To obtain RNA from cultured myotubes, cells were washed with PBS and QIAzol was added. Cells were then scraped off of culture dishes and submitted to brief bead homogenization. For both biopsies and cells, RNA was precipitated and washed using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, 74104). RNA quantity and quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).NanoString nCounterIn human muscle biopsies, all genes except TWEAK were measured using the nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA)42–44. The nCounter system allowed us to design a hypothesis-driven custom probe set containing 6 housekeeping genes and 102 genes of interest related to muscle hypertrophy, extracellular matrix remodeling, macrophages, and inflammation37. The custom code set was then hybridized with 100 ng of RNA from each biopsy. Gene expression was normalized to the geometric mean of six housekeeping genes (β-actin, Cyclophilin A, Cyclophilin B, TATA binding protein, Tubulin-β, and Ubiquitin C), and the mean of eight negative controls was subtracted. The data are presented as normalized counts. Eight genes in the code set were not detectable, leaving us with 94 genes available for analysis. Subjects used for NanoString analysis were the first 20 subjects who completed the study and had sufficient RNA quality (RIN ≥ 7.0) at each time point.Real-time PCRReal-time PCR was used to measure changes in gene expression in cultured human myotubes following FN14 knock-down, as well as TWEAK expression in muscle biopsies (TWEAK was not included in the NanoString code set). RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript™ IV VILO™ (ThermoFisher) and quantitative real-time rtPCR was performed using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher). Gene expression was calculated using the 2^ΔΔCt method, with genes of interest normalized against the geometric mean of three housekeeping genes (18S RNA, β2 microglobulin (B2M), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)). Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table 1.StatisticsAll data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance was predetermined to be P ≤ 0.05. Exact P values for biologically relevant trends are reported. 2-way ANOVA was used to determine whether RE or EET affected skeletal muscle macrophage content, with RE, EET, and RE x EET included in the model as independent variables. Paired t-tests were used to determine the effects of endurance training (biopsy 1 versus biopsy 3) on gene expression and macrophages/fiber. Paired t-tests were also used to determine the transcriptional effects of FN14 knock-down and overexpression in cultured myotubes. Linear regressions employed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient when the two continuous variables were normally distributed (including all figures depicting regressions). Because we designed a hypothesis-driven custom code set, NanoString gene expression analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed with JMP v. 12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6353900.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Isolation, Culturing, and Differentiation of Primary Myoblasts from Skeletal Muscle of Adult Mice","text":"Isolation, Culturing, and Differentiation of Primary Myoblasts from Skeletal Muscle of Adult Mice\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

The schematic view of general procedures for the isolation of primary myoblasts from hind limb muscle of mice. MGM, myoblast growth medium; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DM, differentiation medium.A.  Before isolation of primary myoblasts1.  Autoclave two sets of tools in sterilization pouches each containing one small pair of scissorsand forceps (see Notes 1 and 2).2.  Following Recipe 1, prepare 70% ethanol.3.  Following Recipe 2, prepare 10% Matrigel (see Note 3).4.  Following Recipe 3, prepare collagenase II (see Note 4).5.  Following Recipe 4, prepare base of digestion medium (see Notes 5 and 6).Copyright  2017 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.6.  Following Recipe 5, prepare collection/washing/mincing solution.7.  Following Recipe 6, prepare neutralization/isolation medium (see Note 5).8.  Following Recipe 8, prepare myoblast growth medium (MGM) (see Note 5).9.  Coat 100×20~mm Petri dishes (one plate per mouse) by pouring and spreading 10% Matrigel solution enough to cover the plate area. Avoid bubbles. After 30 sec, remove excess Matrigel solution (excess 10% Matrigel can be collected and stored for re-use multiple times, if kept sterile). Leave the plate without cap to dry in sterile air flow in a biosafety cabinet (20m i n) . Once dried, put lid on the plate and leave in sterile biosafety cabinet at room temperature until ready to use. There is no need to turn on UV light of biosafety cabinet. This plate will be used for isolation and culturing of myoblasts following digestion of muscle with collagenase.10. For muscle collection and washing before digestion, prepare a 6-well plate containing 3 ml/well of collection/washing/mincing solution (only 4 wells of a 6-well plate needed per mouse).11. For muscle mincing following isolation, prepare two 1.5~ml Eppendorf tubes per mouse each containing 500ul of collection/washing/mincing solution.B.  Muscle removal and washing1.  Euthanize mouse following approved IACUC guidelines in your laboratory. For purpose of this protocol, the mouse was given intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at a dose of 250 mg/kg, followed by cervical dislocation.2.  The isolation of hind limb muscles from mice is performed outside a biosafety cabinet. For this step, no sterile techniques are necessary except autoclaved dissection tools and spray of ethanol. Spray hind-limbs with 70% ethanol and pin the mouse face up.3.  Remove skin using autoclaved scissors from both hind-limbs to expose muscles.4.  Using the first pair of autoclaved scissors and forceps, collect tibial anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps and extensor digitorum longus muscles from one hind-limb and place them into one well of 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (Video 1).Video 1. Isolation of hind limb muscles from mouse. This video shows basic steps for isolation of hind limb muscles from euthanized mouse and transferring them into a 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution.()5.  Repeat the previous step on the other hind limb and place the muscles in the second well of 6- well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (see Note 9).6.  Transfer the muscles using the second pair of autoclaved forceps to the other two wells of the 6-well plate filled with collection/washing/mincing solution. This is needed to wash and remove any sticking hair or unwanted tissue on isolated muscles.7.  Put the lid on the 6-well plate containing muscle and collection/washing/mincing solution and spray with 70% ethanol before transferring the plate to a sterile biosafety cabinet. From this step onwards, all the procedure must be performed in biosafety cabinet to avoid potential contamination of myofibers.C.  Muscle mincing/digestion1.  Transfer washed muscles using second pair of autoclaved forceps to two 1.5~ml Eppendorf tubes (one tube for each hind limb muscle group) containing collection/washing/mincing solution and mince muscles very finely using second pair of autoclaved scissors (see Note 10).2.  Once muscles are minced, spin-down tubes using an RT centrifuge at 21, 130xg for 30 sec to separate the minced muscle pieces from the collection/washing/mincing solution.3.  Set spun tubes aside under sterile biosafety cabinet.4.  Complete preparation of digestion media by adding 1 ml of collagenase II to base of digestion media prepared previously (see Note 6). Filter the entire digestion mixture using a 0.22~um syringe filter into a 15ml tube.5.  Remove the supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes containing the minced muscles (in step C2).6.  To transfer the minced muscles to digestion media tube, cut off the tip of a sterile 1 ml pipette tip to create a large bore to accommodate minced muscles’ size.7.  Transfer a small amount of digestion media to the Eppendorf tubes to resuspend minced muscle and then transfer the mix (minced muscles ^+ digestion media) to the original 15~ml digestion media tube (in step C4).8.  Repeat step C7 until all the minced muscles are transferred from the Eppendorf tubes to the 15 ml tube containing digestion mixture.9.  Close the lid of the 15ml tube containing minced muscle and digestion media and wrap the lid with Parafilm to avoid any potential leakage.10. Vortex tube for 5 sec.11. Place tube horizontally in a 37^°C shaker and shake at 100 rpm for 1 h with another 5 sec vortex half way through (see Note 11).12. After 1h , mix should appear cloudy and muscle pieces should be mostly digested and very small (see Note 12).13. Once digestion is complete, vortex tube containing digested muscle mixture for 5 sec.14. Spin the tubes at 1,400xg for 5 min at room temperature.15. Under sterile biosafety cabinet, remove supernatant (digestion media) and discard.16. Resuspend digested muscle pellet in 7m of neutralizing/isolation media using a 10 ml serological pipette. Pipet the digested muscle tissue pellet up and down for 20-30 times using a sterile 10ml pipette. This ensures that most myoblasts are released from the muscle tissues.17. Place a 70um strainer on a 50 m l tube.18. Pre-wet the 70um strainer with _2m l of neutralizing/isolation media.19. Collect resuspended muscle pellet mixture (step C16) using a 10 ml serological pipette and pass through the pre-wet 70um strainer.20. Wash the strainer with _2m l of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are sticking to strainer (most tissue debris will be removed during this step).21. In a 15ml tube, pre-wet a 30um filter with 1~ml of neutralizing/isolation media.22. Pass cell mixture (previously strained through 70um strainer) through the pre-wet 30um filter. This step will remove large infiltrating cells such as macrophages from the myoblasts.23. Wash filter with 1 ml of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are not sticking to the strainer.24. Spin tubes containing cellular mixture at 1,400xg for 5min .25. Remove supernatant (neutralizing/isolation media) and resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml M G M+ bFGF.26. Seed the cellular mixtures onto the 10% Matrigel pre-coated dish.27. Visualize the cells under a microscope. At this step, there will be a heterogeneous mixture of muscle particles and cells (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Representative phase contrast microscopy images of primary myoblast cultures at various stages of purification. Digested muscle mixture following filtration at seeding in 10% Matrigel-coated culturing dish at (A) ^0h , (B) ^24h , and (C) 72h . Appearance of myoblasts after (D) first pre-plating and (E) second pre-plating steps. F. Purified myoblast cultures after 2-4 pre-plating steps. Scale bars =20~um . Blue arrows point to tissue/cellular debris; Red arrows point to fibroblasts (large and flat triangular-shaped) and green arrows point to myoblasts (round or bipolar spindle-shaped).28. Keep the dish in a 37^°C CO2 incubator for 72 h. Do not change medium during this incubation period.29. After 72h , you should be able to visualize adherent, small, droplet-shaped myoblasts and large triangular-shaped fibroblasts in addition to remnant tissue debris.30. At this time, the cells are ready for first pre-plating (see Note 13).D.  Myoblast purification (Pre-Plating)1.  Remove culture media from the dish.2.  Using a 10ml serological pipette, gently wash adherent cells two times with post-isolation media (F-10 medium containing 1% Pen/Strep).3.  Detach cells by adding 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and placing cells at 37^°C in a C O_2 incubator for 2 min.4.  Visualize under the microscope to ensure that all cells are detached.5.  Once cells are detached, add 10ml of M G M+b F G F to dish (see Note 14).6.  Transfer cell mixture to a non-Matrigel coated tissue culture dish and place at 37~^°C in a C O_2 incubator for 45 min. This will allow larger cells such as fibroblasts to adhere in the bottom of the dish while most myoblasts would still be suspended in the media.7.  During this time, coat a new Petri dish with 10% Matrigel as described above.8.  After 45 min, transfer all supernatant from pre-plating dish to the new Matrigel-coated dish and place the dish in  G O_2 incubator (see Note 15).9.  Pre-plating step should be performed every 36-48 h until >98% myoblast purity is achieved (see Note 16). Representative phase contrast images at various steps of myoblast isolation are presented in Figures 2C-2E. Purified myoblast culture image is presented in Figure 2F.E.  Culturing of myoblasts1.  The purified myoblasts are maintained in culture by incubation in the myoblast growth medium and changing media every other day.2.  Do not allow cells to reach >70% confluency (unless experimentally required) as this will lead to pre-mature differentiation and fusion of myoblasts with each other.3.  Expand cells by splitting into multiple 10% Matrigel-coated Petri dishes as needed.4.  The myoblasts can be collected in freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen tank or -80~^°C freezer like any other cultured cells. Primary myoblasts maintain their proliferation and differentiation capacity once thawed and cultured again.F.  Differentiating primary myoblasts to myotubes1.  Coat tissue culture plates with 10% Matrigel similar to those described above.2.  Plate primary myoblasts in pre-coated Matrigel plates. For obtaining good quality myotubes, myoblasts should be at 85-95% confluency before adding differentiation medium (DM). For a 6- well tissue culture plate, we need 0.75–0.9×10^6 cells per well; however, this number will vary depending on the cell passage number. Low passage cells are normally smaller in size therefore use the higher end of the range to achieve desired confluency, whereas higher passage cells are more elongated and larger in size so the lower end of cell number will be required (see Note 17).3.  Next day, replace myoblast growth medium with DM (see Note 18).4.  DM should be changed every 48 h .5.  Myoblasts align and fusion starts within 24-36 h after incubation in DM. At 48 h, small myotubes can be clearly seen, and by 72-96 h they become large and mature.G. Immunostaining of primary myoblasts and myotubes1.  Remove culture media from 6-well tissue culture plates containing primary myoblasts ormyotubes which are adhered to surface of the wells.2.  Fix adhered cells by adding appropriate amount of 4% PFA to cover cells and incubate 15 min.3.  Remove 4% PFA and gently wash the cells three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each.4.  Permeabilize the cells by adding 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubate for 7 min at room temperature.5.  Remove 0.3% Triton X-100 and gently wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.6.  Remove PBS and block cells by adding 2% BSA solution for _20m i n .7.  Prepare primary antibody mixtures in blocking solution.Note: We use 1:10 dilution of Pax7 antibody, 1:200 dilution of MyoD, and 1:200 dilution of MF20 (i.e., MyHC) antibody.8.  Remove blocking solution and add desired primary antibody mixture to each well.9.  Wrap plates with Parafilm to prevent evaporation of primary antibody solution.10. Primary antibody incubation can be performed for 1-2h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C .11. Once primary antibody incubation period is completed, remove primary antibody solution and wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.12. Prepare secondary antibody mixture in blocking solution at a concentration of 1:1,500 for each secondary antibody. Note: We use anti-mouse Alexa 568 for red fluorescence and anti-rabbit Alexa 488 for green fluorescence.13. Wrap plates with Parafilm to prevent evaporation of secondary antibody.14. Secondary antibody incubation is performed at room temperature for 1 h in the dark.15. Remove secondary antibody solution and wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.16. Prepare DAPI working solution in PBS.17. Remove PBS from the wells and add DAPI solution for staining nuclei.18. DAPI incubation is performed at room temperature for 3 min in the dark.19. Remove DAPI and wash the cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.20. Add PBS to the wells.21. The cells are now ready to be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. Representative images of myoblast culture after staining with anti-Pax7, anti-MyoD, and DAPI are presented in Figure 3. Differentiated myotube culture images after staining with anti-MyHC and DAPI are presented in Figure 4.()Figure 3. Staining of primary myoblast culture for Pax7 and MyoD.

This strain was isolated by Burge and Pfefferkorn in 1966 by collecting virus that was resistant to heating to 54°C (80). The choice of strain is important, because this strain produces high titers (1010 PFU/ml) of highly infectious and physically stable virus. Chikungunya virus West African strain 37997 was grown and harvested as described in reference 81. Mayaro virus strain CH was utilized for the study and was kindly provided by Scott Weaver at UTMB. Propagation of HepG2 cells (human) and C7-10 cells (mosquito) was as described previously (82). Influenza A/PR/8/34 virus and the MDCK cells used to propagate and titer the virus were a kind gift of Scott Laster, and they were propagated as detailed in reference 83. All cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Vero, CCL-81; HEK293, CRL-1573; HepG2, HB-8065; BHK21, C-13) except for the C7-10 (Aedes albopictus) cells, which were obtained from internal collections (84). Culture medium from each uninfected cell culture was harvested and served as a negative control. Virus and negative controls were harvested from 10 T-75 flasks (Corning), which produces enough virus to form a visible band in a 30-ml potassium tartrate gradient. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/ml, allowed to replicate for a single cycle, and harvested at 18 h postinfection to ensure that no cell lysis took place. The supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation. Twenty ml of the resulting virus was loaded onto a 15 to 35% linear potassium tartrate gradient and twice purified by isopycnic ultracentrifugation (18 h at 24,000 rpm; Beckman SW-28 rotor). The resulting band of purified virus was collected and washed twice by pelleting the virus in 1× PBS. A sample of the purified population was then visualized by transmission electron microscopy to check for contaminating cellular organelles or membrane fragments as previously described (85). Additionally, to check for copurified protein contaminants, each preparation was resolved on a 4 to 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) as described previously (86) and stained with silver in the method of Wray et al. (87) or with Coomassie blue. Visualized bands (silver stain only) were excised, and an in-gel digestion was performed as described previously (88) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis for protein identification.Sindbis virus particle analysis for nsP2.Gradient-purified SINV was washed with 1 M KCl to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Purified SINV particles were then separated into glycoprotein and nucleocapsid fractions by treatment with 4% or 5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37°C and pelleted for 45 min through PBS at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman XL 90 centrifuge (89). The supernatant (glycoprotein fraction) was saved and the resulting pellet (nucleocapsid fraction) was washed twice by pelleting through PBS in the same manner. The nucleocapsid fraction was then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, SDS-PAGE, or fluorography. Location of the nsP2 protein within the outer or inner shells of the particle was done using staining of 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gels and Western blotting of the glycoprotein and NC fractions of the particle. Virus particles (∼5 μg per lane) were prepared in SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol and boiled for approximately 10 min. The samples were run on an SDS-PAGE Bis-Tris 12% gradient gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at ambient temperature. The membrane was then probed for 1 h with a rabbit antibody raised against nsP2 (a gift from R. Hardy) or anti-C protein (a gift from S. Mukhopadhyay) diluted in PBS supplemented with 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at ambient temperature. The blot was washed 3 times for 5 min each with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 at ambient temperature. Finally, the membrane was probed with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody that was conjugated with IRDye 800CW near-infrared dye diluted in PBS supplemented with 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% SDS at ambient temperature. The blot was subsequently washed 3 times for 5 min each with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 at ambient temperature, washed once with water, dried, and imaged according to LI-COR Odyssey CLx instructions.Protein extraction and digestion.Viral preparations and their respective negative controls were processed for LC-MS/MS analysis using the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method as previously described (90). Briefly, following purification the total protein concentration was determined and all preparations were normalized using sterile PBS to 0.5 μg/μl, aliquoted in 10-μg fractions, and stored at −80°C. A total of 10 μg of total protein (20 μl) was mixed 1:1 with MPER (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and heated to 95°C for 10 min. Once cooled to room temperature, the samples were mixed with 200 μl of UA (8 M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), placed over a 30-kDa filter spin column (Ultracell YM-30; Millipore), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature to collect all proteins on the filter membrane. Denatured and reduced proteins were then alkylated by adding 100 μl of IAA solution (0.05 M iodoacetamide in UA) to each filter and incubating at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Following alkylation, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to remove the alkylation solution. Each sample next was washed three times with 100 μl of UA and then three times with 100 μl of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min was used to remove each wash, including the final wash. To digest the captured protein, 100 μl of a trypsin digestion solution (10 μg/ml in 100 mM TEAB) was placed on each membrane and incubated in a sealed tube overnight at 37°C with shaking. After incubation, the peptides were collected for LC-MS/MS analysis in a clean tube by centrifuging each tube for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The membrane was washed by centrifugation one time with 50 μl 100 mM TEAB and once with 50 μl of 0.5 M NaCl. All washes were collected and pooled with the final peptide eluate. Each sample was then acidified using 10% trifluoroacetic acid until the final pH was roughly 2 to 3. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, each sample was desalted using C18 desalting columns (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's directions.LC-MS/MS analysis.Tryptic peptides were analyzed (technical triplicates) on an Orbitrap ELITE mass spectrometer coupled with the Easy-nLC II liquid chromatography pump system. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 3% acetonitrile–0.1% formic acid and resolved on a virgin Picofrit HPLC column (15 cm; 75-μm inner diameter; packed with 5 μm BioBasic C18 particles at 300 Å; New Objective) using a 130-min multistep gradient (0 to 5 min, 5 to 10% buffer B; 6 to 110 min, 10 to 35% buffer B; and 111 to 130 min, 35 to 95% buffer B). For the gradient, the A buffer is 3% acetonitrile–0.1% formic acid and the B buffer is 95% acetonitrile–0.1% formic acid. Orbitrap MS1 scans were performed at a resolution of 120,000 at 400 m/z, with a scan range of 110 to 2,000 m/z. The top 20 precursors were selected for MS2 data-dependent fragmentation. An MS2 spectrum was acquired using ion trap scanning in normal mode (top 20 method). The minimum signal required to trigger a data-dependent scan was 5,000. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to generate MS2 spectra with the following settings: normalized collision energy, 35%; default charge state, 2; isolation width, 2 m/z; activation time, 10 ms. The AGC target was set to 1 × 106 for MS and 5 ×104 for MS/MS, with a maximum accumulation time of 200 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set for 60 s for up to 500 targets with a 5-ppm mass window. A lock mass of 445.120025 was used for internal calibration to improve mass accuracy.Mass spectrometry data processing.Spectral data were processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 with the SEQUEST search algorithm against a Sindbis virus polyprotein database (Uniprot ID P03317) merged with either Homo sapiens (RefSeq TaxID 9606) or Cricetulus griseus (RefSeq TaxID 10029). The Aedes albopictus-deduced proteome (35) data were downloaded from VectorBase (91). Additional peptides were downloaded from the NCBI TSA database. The nonredundant proteomes were organized on Excel spreadsheets (92) and annotated as described previously (93). The resulting FASTA file was merged with the SINV polyprotein and used to search against the SINV mosquito preparations. Dynamic modifications were set for carbamidomethylation of cysteine [+57.02 Da], oxidation of methionine [+15.99 Da], and N-terminal acetylation [+42.011 Da]. MS/MS spectra were searched with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Trypsin was specified as the protease, with the maximum number of missed cleavages set to 2. A false discovery rate was calculated using PERCOLATOR and was set at <1% to score high-confidence peptide identifications. Grouping and functional analysis were performed using the PANTHER classification system for the human background, using only each protein's accession number (94).Phenotypic studies with stable KO HEK293 cells.HEK293 knockout (KO) cell lines were purchased from Applies Biological Materials, Inc. (Richmond, BC, Canada). SNX5 and RBM3 KO was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Cell lines were propagated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Briefly, HEK293 monolayers were infected at equal MOIs (approximately 10 PFU/cell) of SVHR, CHIKV, or MAYV and allowed to incubate for 20 h. Supernatants were titrated on BHK cells by the standard plaque assay to determine the virus titer. As a measure of the knockout cells' ability to replicate an unrelated enveloped virus, influenza A/PRF/8/34 virus was used to infect the wild-type and ΔSNX5 HEK293 cells. Infectious virus titer was determined by plaque assay. Both ΔSNX5 HEK293 cells and wild-type cells produced an equivalent amount of infectious virus after 24 h.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6026752.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Mouse Liver Mitochondria Isolation, Size Fractionation, and Real-time MOMP Measurement","text":"Mouse Liver Mitochondria Isolation, Size Fractionation, and Real-time MOMP Measurement\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 50 m l conical centrifuge tube (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number: sc-200251)\n2.

Liver mitochondria isolationAnimal handling, euthanasia, and dissection must be done following the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. We have successfully utilized carbon dioxide asphyxiation before cervical dislocation to euthanize the mice. However, we advise the reader to consult and follow the Animal Care and Use guidelines of their own institute for the appropriate procedure. Following steps involved in animal handling and dissection are executed wearing gloves.1.  Visualize the liver, the bile duct, and gallbladder. The bile duct and gallbladder must be removed or kept separate from the liver to avoid contamination of the mitochondria with bile (Figure 1ac).2.  Excise the four liver lobes and transfer immediately to a 50 ml conical tube containing ice-cold PBS. In case of blood contamination, soak the liver in ice-cold PBS until no more blood is washed out (Figure 1d-e).Note: From this point, all the steps must be performed using reagents and materials at 4^°C to minimize the activation of proteases and phospholipases.()# Figure 1. Mouse dissection3.  Transfer the liver with forceps to a clean Petri dish placed on ice and drain off the excess PBS.4.  Mince the liver using a clean razor blade until forming a homogeneous paste (Figure 2).5.  Transfer half of the liver paste using the razor blade as a spoon into a chilled Potter-Elvehjemdounce homogenizer containing 10ml TIB.6.  Insert the pestle into the homogenizer and gently push it downwards. Early resistance iscommon during the first strokes, and no excessive force should be applied to the liver paste. Instead, move the pestle upwards to resuspend the liver paste and slowly repeat those steps until all the material is able to go past the pestle without strong resistance. The homogenization step can be done on the bench as long the whole procedure is done quickly enough to maintain the temperature close to 4^°C .7.  Homogenize the paste five times, pour into a 15~ml conical tube and store on ice until all the liver paste is processed (Figure 2).8.  Repeat steps 6-8 with the second half of the liver paste.9.  The following differential centrifugation steps are required to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. All the steps should be performed in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4~^°C . Resuspension of pellets is done gently by pipetting using a P1000 pipette (Figure 2).a. 600xg for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant (S/N) to a clean, pre-chilled 15ml conical tube.b. 3,500xg for 10 min. Discard the S/N. Resuspend the pellet in 10ml TIB.c. 1,500xg for 5 min. Transfer the S/N to a clean, pre-chilled 15ml conical tube.d. 5,500× g for 10min . Discard the S/N. Resuspend the pellet in 10ml TIB.e.  Repeat steps A9b to A9d, but resuspend the final pellet in 500ul TIB.10. To quantify the amount of isolated material in the resuspended pellet (step A9e), add 5ul of the resuspended pellet to 995~ul of TIB (1:200 dilution) and measure the OD520 with a spectrophotometer. Dilute the mitochondria with TIB to standardize the sample to an OD520 value of 0.25 (20u/ul of protein).11. At this point the isolated mitochondria can be aliquoted (50~u/) , frozen in dry ice-ethanol to prevent formation of water crystals, and stored at -80~^°C .Note: Freshly isolated mitochondria from the previous step should be kept on ice and used within _2h to ensure integrity of the outer membrane. If frozen mitochondria are used, thaw the sample in a 30~^°C water bath and continue using TIB in the subsequent procedures.()B.  Mitochondria labeling with JC-1 and size fractionationLabeling mitochondria with JC-1, a potential-dependent mitochondrial dye that changes color as membrane potentials increase during MOMP, allows to standardize the mitochondria fractions and to record MOMP in real-time (as example, see Renault et al., 2015, Figure 4F). The labeling and fractionation step offers the opportunity to select the mitochondria by size: big mitochondria will be eluted prior to smaller ones. This fractionation step is optional and requires to calibrate the column using liposomes of a known size as a standard. Another option is to determine the average mitochondrial size in each fraction a posteriori, using for example dynamic light scattering. If fractionation by size is not desired, all the mitochondria-containing fractions can be combined in step B8.1.  Dilute 50ul of mitochondria in 250ul TIB buffer.2.  Add JC-1 (200~uM) to the diluted mitochondria to a final concentration of 15uM and incubate for 10 min at 30^°C (Figure 3).()Mitochondrial Labeling and Size FractionationFigure 3. Mitochondrial labeling and size fractionation3.  To remove unbound JC-1, centrifuge the mitochondria at 5,550xg for 10 min at room temperature and resuspend the pellet in 25ul TIB.4.  Pre-equilibrate a 2 ml CL-2B gravity-column with 2 column volumes of TIB (4~ml) using gravity to let the TIB to flow through the CL-2B resin, load the resuspended JC-1 mitochondria onto the column, and allow sample to flow through.5.  Slowly apply 4 column volumes of TIB (4×2ml) to the column using a clean Pasteur pipet and collect 20×100ul ( 2-3 drops) fractions in micro-centrifuge tubes.6.  To determine which fractions contain labeled mitochondria, pre-fill a 96-well plate with 95~ul of 0.1% Triton X-100 in water 1.1% Triton X-100 permeabilizes mitochondria) and add 5ul sample of each fraction to a separate well.7.  Measure the fluorescence using a spectrophotometer E X:561 n m/E m:620n m) to identify the mitochondria-containing fractions (typical values are 10,000-50,000 Relative Fluorescence Units for big mitochondria, and >500 RFU for small size mitochondria).8.  Combine the desired fractions containing JC-1 labeled mitochondria and standardize the samples using relative JC-1 fluorescence intensity (determine the fluorescence of each combined sample as described in step B6-7 and dilute the most concentrated samples with TIB buffer to reach the concentration of the lowest sample). Note: In our experience 0.05-1 µm liposomes were subjected onto the CL-2B gravity-column and used as reference for selecting appropriate fractions. Briefly, fluorescent liposomes of several sizes (0.05, 0.2, and 1 µm) were prepared according to Asciolla et al., 2012. The liposomes were loaded onto the CL-2B gravity column and 100 µl fractions were collected, as described in steps B4-6 of this protocol. Identification of liposome-containing fractions for each liposome size allows to determine in which fractions vesicles of a given size should be expected.C. Real-time MOMP measurementsReal-time MOMP quantification is determined by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (_M) using the fluorescent JC-1 dye. The JC-1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green ( 529 n m) to red (590 n m) . MOMP and the subsequent loss of _M are indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. There is a plethora of options to investigate a subset of inducers and regulators of MOMP in real-time. It is important to have internal and experimental controls. An example is given in Table 1. For the positive internal control, we use FCCP that uncouples the electron transport from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and completely depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane. To generate a positive experimental control, we use detergent-activated recombinant BAX (Hsu and Youle, 1997). The detergent,  -octylglucoside (OG), artificially triggers BAX activation, and therefore BAXOG (20-50n M) can be used as a reliable positive control (for 100ul of 2.3uM BAXOG: 5ug BAX +0.7% OG in liposome buffer, incubate for 60 min at 4^°C , aliquot and store at -80^°C_. ).Real-time measurements1.  Prepare a 2x proteins/inducers solution in TIB and dispense 50ul in each well in a 96-well plate. The plate should contain the following internal and experimental controls (Figure 4; Table 1)a.  Negative internal control: TIB onlyb.  Positive internal control: FCCP ( 10uM final concentration)c. Negative experimental control: purified recombinant BAX (20-50 nM final concentration)d. Positive experimental control:  -octylglucoside-activated BAX (BAXOG, 20-50 nM final concentration)()Real-Time MOMPFigure 4. Real-Time MOMP2.  Prepare a 2x suspension of JC-1 loaded mitochondria (2.5R F U/uI) and add 50ul to each well to reach a final concentration of 1.25:R F U/muI . Note: ~50-100 RFUs per reaction is ideal.3.  Measure fluorescence every 5 min in a plate reader for 60~m i n (Ex: 561 nm/Em: 620 nm) at 37^°C .4.  Calculate the percentage of mitochondria that have undergone MOMP using the following formula:% MOMP = (RFUbuffer − RFUsample) / (RFUbuffer − RFUFCCP)Where RFUbuffer and RFUFCCP represent the fluorescence of the negative and positive internal controls, respectively, and RFUsample the fluorescence of the sample (see Figure 4G-H as example in Renault et al., 2015).Table 1.

(1989). Plasmids were purified using the GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, MO, Saint Louis, USA). The genomic DNA was extracted with the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, MO, Saint Louis, USA). Triparental mating between E. coli and Psav DAPP‐PG 722 was performed using a helper E. coli strain carrying plasmid pRK2013 (Figurski and Helinski, 1979).Determination of the cytosolic Ca2+ levelsCytosolic Ca2+ levels were determined using a fluorimetric method, which employed the fluorescent probe Fura 2‐AM (Fura 2‐acetoxy methyl ester; Sigma‐Aldrich, MO, Saint Louis, USA). Approximately 5 × 106 cells of Psav DAPP‐PG 722 grown at 27 ± 1°C for 16 h in LB broth to a stationary phase, were suspended in 0.12 M Tris (pH 7.8) and 2 mM EGTA. At 200 s after incubation at 25 °C, 2 mM CaCl2 was added to stop the EGTA effect as reported by Grynkiewicz et al. (1985). Then the cells were incubated for 2 h in basal condition i.e. HBSS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mM Fura 2‐AM (dissolved in DMSO) or in HBSS buffer supplemented with 2 mM Fura 2‐AM and different carbon sources (glucose, fructose or sucrose, 5 mM) or ATP 50 µM. The fluorescence intensities of Fura 2‐AM (Ex. = 335 nm, Em. = 505 nm) were monitored with a spectrofluorophotometer (Perkin‐Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was calculated following the formula reported by Grynkiewicz et al. (1985).Phylogenetic analysis of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger geneA comparative phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the cneA gene coding for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was performed using the Geneious resource (Kearse et al., 2012). Blast searches were used to retrieve the close homologs of the cneA gene from different Pseudomonas species. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis was conducted using MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016) and the maximum likelihood method. Clade stability was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replications.Construction of a P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi knockout mutant of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene cneA A genomic null mutant of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene (referred to as cneA gene) was created as follows. An internal 305 bp fragment of the cneA gene was amplified from Psav DAPP‐PG 722 genomic DNA using the primers cneA For and cneA Rev (Table 2). The amplified PCR product was cloned in plasmid pKNOCK‐Km (Alexeyev, 1999), generating pKNOCK‐cneA (Table 2). A Psav‐cneA knockout mutant (Table 2) was generated by homologous recombination (Alexeyev, 1999) after transformation of pKNOCK‐cneA in Psav DAPP‐PG 722 as a suicide delivery system. Transformants were selected on KB‐Nitrof + Km plates. Interruption of cneA was verified by PCR using primers specific to the pKNOCK‐Km vector and to the genomic DNA sequences upstream and downstream of the targeted gene. The amplicons were sequenced at Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands; http://www.macrogen.com).Plasmid and chromosomal complementation of Psav‐cneA mutantComplementation of Psav‐cneA mutant with a plasmid encoding the cneA gene was performed as follows. The complete sequence of the cneA open reading frame (ORF) with its ribosome binding site was amplified from Psav DAPP‐PG 722 genomic DNA using primers cneA compl 1 and cneA compl 2 (Table 2) and Q5®High‐Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). The amplified fragment was purified from an agarose gel using the EuroGOLD Gel Extraction Kit (EuroClone, Milan, Italy) following the instructions of the manufacturer. After A‐tailing (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), the fragments were cloned in pGEM‐T Easy vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) and sequenced at Macrogen Europe. Having verified the correctness of the sequence, the cneA ORF was excised from pGEM‐T Easy Vector using XhoI and SpeI and cloned in the corresponding sites of the plasmid pBBR MCS‐5. The resulting plasmid (pBBR MCS‐5‐cneA; Table 2) was purified using the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, MO, Saint Louis, USA) and transformed in Psav‐cneA by electroporation, generating Psav‐cneA mutant (pBBR::cneA) (Table 2).Chromosomal complementation of the Psav‐cneA mutant was performed using the Tn7 transposon vector pUC18R6KT‐miniTn7BB‐Gm. The complete ORF of the cneA gene, including its own promoter, was amplified from Psav DAPP‐PG 722 chromosomal DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the primers PromAP_Fw and AP_Rev (Table 2). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in the pGEM‐T Easy Vector (Promega, WI, Fitchburg, USA) and sequenced at GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Once verified the correctness of the sequence, the cneA gene was excised from pGEM using EcoRI and cloned in the corresponding site of the plasmid pUC18R6KT‐miniTn7BB‐Gm, yielding pUC18R6KT‐miniTn7BB‐cneA‐Gm (Table 2) that was electroporated in Psav‐cneA. Selection of the transconjugants in KB‐Gm plates yielded the complemented strain Psav‐cneA mutant (miniTn7::cneA) (Table 2). Insertion of the Tn7 transposon into the correct site was verified using the primers GlmS_savastanoi (hybridizing at the 3′ of the glmS gene) and the Tn7Rev primer (hybridizing at the Tn7R end of the integrated plasmid) (Table 2). Only in the case of integration, a 165 bp fragment was amplified.Phenotypic characterizations of the Psav‐cneA mutant and its complemented strains In vitro bacterial growth dynamics of wild‐type Psav and the Psav‐cneA mutant strains were carried out in KB liquid medium at 27 °C. Bacterial growth was spectrophotometrically followed every hour for 24 h at OD660 and through colony counts at 4, 8, 20, 24 and 28 h post‐incubation (hpi). For each bacterial strains, the relationship between the number of cells (log10 transformed) and the hpi was investigated by means of a second‐order polynomial model. Likelihood ratio test was used to assess the differences between wild type and Psav‐cneA mutant strains under R statistical environment (R Core Team, 2018).The HR assay was carried out in Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Havana 425) plants. To prepare the inoculum, the strains were grown in NA at 27 °C for 24 h, resuspended in sterile deionized water and spectrophotometrically adjusted to 108 CFU/mL. About 10 µL of the bacterial suspensions or water (control) was infiltrated into the mesophyll of tobacco leaves using a needleless syringe. The appearance of the HR was scored at 24 hpi.Proteolytic activity, swarming and swimming were determined as reported by Huber et al. (2001). Qualitative analysis of EPSs was tested on KB and LB solid medium amended with 5% of sucrose (LBS). Single colonies, previously obtained from NA plates, were streaked on KB and LBS and then grown at 28 ºC for 48 h. Colonies producing EPSs showed a fluidal, mucoid appearance. Production of AHLs was performed in T‐streak analysis as described by Piper et al. (1993) using the C. violaceum CVO26 as AHL biosensor. To measure biofilm formation, overnight cultures of Psav DAPP‐PG 722, Psav‐cneA mutant and Psav‐cneA mutant (pBBR::cneA) grown in KB broth, were diluted to OD600nm = 0.1 and loaded in a 96‐well plate (150 µL per well, eight wells per strain). Plates were incubated under static or shaking conditions and biofilm formation was quantified by measurement of the A595 after 24 h and 48 h after crystal violet staining (O'Toole and Kolter, 1998). Pseudomonas putida KT2240 was included as a positive control for biofilm formation and cell‐free KB as negative control.Pathogenicity test on olive plantsDisease severity and bacterial growth were tested in 1‐year‐old olive (cv. Frantoio) plants inoculated with the strains Psav DAPP‐PG 722, Psav‐cneA mutant, Psav‐cneA mutant (pBBR::cneA) and Psav‐cneA mutant (miniTn7:: cneA) (Table 2). To prepare the inoculum, bacteria were grown on NA at 27 °C for 48 h, resuspended in sterile deionized water and adjusted spectrophotometrically to approximately 1 × 108 CFU/mL−1. Also, 20 μL of bacterial suspension or water (control plant) was placed in wounds (five per plant) made in the bark of olive plants using a sterile scalpel as previously described (Moretti et al., 2008). Wounds in the inoculated and control plants were protected with parafilm (American National Can, IL, Chicago, USA) until the developing knots break it (14 to 21 days). Plants were maintained in transparent polycarbonate boxes to reach high RH values (90%–100%) and kept in a growth chamber at 22 °C to 24 °C with illumination at 70 μE/m‐2s‐1 and 12 h light period. The Psav population density was calculated at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 60 dpi by serial dilution of the bacterial suspension obtained from inoculated sites excised and homogenized by mechanical disruption and plated in NA medium. Colony counts were calculated 24 h and 48 h after incubation at 27 °C. The disease severity was recorded at 60 dpi by determining the knot volume, by measuring the length, width and depth of every knot with a Vernier caliper (Moretti et al., 2008). Four plant replicates were included in each of the two in planta experiments performed.Transcriptional analysis of Psav pathogenicity and virulence genesTo verify whether Ca2+ entry promotes the expression of pathogenicity (hrpL, hrpA and iaaM) and virulence (ptz) genes of Psav, transcriptional fusions of their promoters were constructed with LacZ reporter gene. For amplification of the iaaM and ptz promoters, the regions upstream of the iaaM and ptz ORFs (477 bp and 373 bp, respectively) were amplified by PCR using primers iaaM For, iaaM Rev, ptz For and ptz Rev (Table 2). Amplicons were cloned into pMP220 in order to obtain promoter fusions to lacZ. The resulting plasmids and those encoding the hrpL and hrpA promoters fused to lacZ (Aragόn et al., 2014) were transferred by conjugation into both wild‐type Psav DAPP‐PG 722 and its cneA mutant. Cells carrying the plasmids grown overnight in KB media were diluted in the same media and incubated at 28 ºC to OD660 of 0.5 (time = 0). The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mM MgCl2 and the cells were transferred to Hrp medium (Huynh et al., 1989), HBSS and HBSS amended with CaCl2. The cultures were adjusted to OD660 of 0.5 and incubated for 6 h at 28 ºC. β‐galactosidase enzymatic activity was measured using the methods developed (Miller, 1972) and modified previously (Maloy, 1990). Psav DAPP‐PG 722 and its cneA mutant transformed with pMP220 (encoding a promoterless lacZ) were used as negative controls. To determine the activity associated exclusively to the promoter fusions to lacZ, the background activity detected in the control strains was subtracted from those obtained for each of their corresponding transformants.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6637891.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Hedgehog (Hh) Reporter Activity Assay","text":"Hedgehog (Hh) Reporter Activity Assay\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

The cells were cultured in rich medium (TY: 10 g Tryptone (Bacto laboratories, Australia), 5 g yeast extract (Duchefa, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and 5 g NaCl (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ) per litre) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (Merck) or in glucose minimal medium (Gb1: 6.33 g K2HPO4 (Merck), 2.95 g KH2PO4 (Riedel de Haen, Seelze, Germany), 1.05 g (NH4)2SO4 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.10 g MgSO4·7H2O (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 0.28 mg FeSO4·7H2O (Sigma), 7.1 mg Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Sigma), 4 mg thiamine (Sigma), and 4 g glucose per litre, pH 7.0) at 28°C while shaking at 205 rpm. For growth in Gb1 of LMC500‐ and CS109‐based strains, 50 mg/l lysine (Sigma) was added. Growth in rich and poor medium was at 37 and 28°C, respectively. Expression of constructs was induced with 15 µM isopropyl β‐D‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Promega, Madison, WI) unless stated otherwise. Plasmids were maintained in the strains by addition of 100 µg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) or 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma). Growth was measured by absorbance at 600 or 450 nm with a Biochrom Libra S70 spectrophotometer (Harvard Biosciences, Holliston, MA) for TY or Gb1 cultures, respectively. Fixation was done with a final concentration of 2.8% formaldehyde and 0.04% glutaraldehyde in the shaking water bath for 15 min, after which the cells were harvested. After fixation, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml PBS.Table 2Strains used in this studyStrainRelevant characteristicsReferencesDH5αF‐, supE44, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi1, relA1Bethesda Research Laboratories (1986)LMC500MC4100, F‐, araD139, ∆(argF‐lac)U169, deoC1, flbB5301, lysA1, ptsF25, rbsR, relA1, rpsL150Taschner et al.

The sfTq2 nucleotide sequence (encoding mTurquoise2 with S30R, Y39N, F99S, N105T and I171V) was obtained by gene synthesis (MWG biotech). New constructs were created by restriction ligation cloning or site‐directed mutagenesis. Inserted fragments were amplified by PCR from plasmid or the E. coli (LMC500) chromosome template, purified and restricted. For mutagenesis, a whole plasmid template was amplified by PCR using primers that contain the desired mutation. The resulting product was treated with DpnI to digest the methylated template plasmid. All restriction enzymes used were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Ipswich, MA). For all PCR amplifications for cloning, the high‐fidelity polymerase pfux7 was used (Nørholm, 2010) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. An overview of the used primers is shown in Table S4.Imaging and image analysisFor imaging the cells were immobilized on 1% agarose in water slabs on object glasses as described (Koppelman et al., 2004) and photographed with a Hamamatsu ORCA‐Flash‐4.0LT (Hamamatsu, Naka‐ku, Japan) CMOS camera mounted on an Olympus BX‐60 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) through a UPlanApo 100×/N.A. 1.35 oil Iris Ph3 objective. Images were acquired using the Micro Manager 1.4 plugin for ImageJ (Edelstein et al., 2010). In all experiments, the cells were first photographed in phase contrast mode and then in fluorescence mode. The fluorescence filter cubes used were: U‐MNG (red and orange, ex560/40, dic585LP, em630/75), EN‐GFP (green, ex470/40, dic495LP, em525/50) and Cyan‐GFPv2 (cyan, ex436/20, dic455LP, em480/40). Fluorescence backgrounds were subtracted using the modal values from the fluorescence images. Quantifications of cellular fluorescence were done using the ObjectJ plug‐in of ImageJ (Vischer et al., 2015). Living cells were imaged directly from the growing cultures and fixed cells directly after fixation and PBS washing. After fixation, the samples were allowed to mature overnight at RT, washed once more with 1 ml PBS and were then imaged. These samples are indicated in the text as ‘matured’.Western blot analysisSamples for SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting were prepared by pelleting live cells and equalizing biomass in MilliQ and subsequent boiling (95°C) in a sample buffer (0.0625 M Tris‐Hcl pH 6.8, SDS 2%, glycerol 10%, bromphenol blue 0.001%) with and without dithiothreitol (0.1 M) reducing agent. Samples were loaded on 10% SDS‐PAGE gels (stacking buffer (0.5 M Tris‐HCl pH 6.8, 0.4% SDS), separating buffer (1.5 M Tris‐HCl pH 8.7, 0.4% SDS), separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad) by wet blotting; bound antibodies were detected with the Odyssey FC scanner (LI‐COR). The used antibodies were polyclonal rabbit α‐GFP (1:2,000, Fisher Scientific) and polyclonal goat α‐rabbit IRDye® 680LT (1:20,000, LI‐COR).FRET experiments and spectral measurementsFRET experiments were performed as described in (Meiresonne et al., 2018) with modifications for the sfTq2‐mNG FRET pair. Acceptor and donor emission spectra were collected with a fluorometer (Photon Technology International, NJ) through 6 nm slit widths with 1 s integration time per scanned nm and three times averaging. For the acceptor (mNG) channel, samples were excited by the monochromator set at 504 nm through a 500 ± 10 nm single band pass (BP) filter (BrightLine, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and emission wavelengths from 512 to 650 nm at 1 nm increments were measured through a 510 nm long‐pass (LP) filter (Chroma technology corp., Bellow falls, VT). This spectrum was used to determine the amount of mNG in the sample. For the donor (mTq2, sfTq2 or sfTq2ox) channel, samples were excited by the monochromator set at 450 nm through a 435 ± 40 nm BP filter (Semrock) and emission wavelengths from 470 to 650 nm at 1 nm increments were collected through a 458 nm LP filter (Semrock). Knowing the amount of mNG present in the sample and the shape of the mNG and mTq2 variant reference spectra and background fluorescence spectrum in the cells, the sample spectra were unmixed into their separate components: background fluorescence, mTq2, mNG and sensitized emission (FRET). The FRET efficiencies were calculated using the published algorithms (Alexeeva et al., 2010; Meiresonne et al., 2018), using the spectral properties of mTq2 and mNG (Goedhart et al., 2012; Shaner et al., 2013). Spectral measurements using a multimode plate reader (BIOTEK Synergy MX, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) were performed as described (Meiresonne et al., 2017; 2018) with the mTq2 variant donor channel acquisition set at 450 nm and emission scanning from 470 to 650 nm with minimal slit widths of 9 nm.Frequency domain fluorescence lifetime measurementsFLIM experiments were essentially performed as described before (Goedhart et al., 2012). For periplasmic samples in the solution, the exposure time was 500 ms, and the number of phase steps 18.OSER assayThe OSER assay uses an ER localization sequence (CytERM) that was inserted in the multiple cloning site of pmTurquoise2‐N1 to obtain CytERM‐mTurquoise2 (Addgene plasmid Plasmid #98833). The coding sequence of mTurquoise2 was replaced by the superfolder variants. After transfection of the plasmids, the localization of the fusion was visualized by confocal microscopy. The OSER assay was performed as described before (Costantini et al., 2012).Molecular brightness assayThe cellular brightness assay was performed in HeLa cells as described before (Mastop et al., 2017).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6850650.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Characterization of HBV Isolates from Patient Serum Samples and Cloning","text":"Characterization of HBV Isolates from Patient Serum Samples and Cloning\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

Add 125~ul Tris phenol and 125~ul Trichloromethane, vigorously vortex for 10 sec. Then, centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. This step can separate protein from nucleic acid and nucleic acid would be in the aqueous upper layer.3.  Transfer aqueous upper layer into a new 1.5ml tube.4.  Add 20 u Yeast RNA (as a co-precipitant here), 0.1 volume NaOAc and 0.7 volume Isopropyl alcohol. After inverting several times, precipitate the mixture overnight at - -20~^°C .5.  Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 15min at 4^°C and throw away the supernatant.6.  Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol and gently invert.7.  Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4^°C and throw away the supernatant.8.  Dry the DNA pellet for 510 min (air-drying) and dissolve in 20~ul ddH2O as the PCR template.B.  Amplification of HBV DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1.  PCR system:()Add ddH2O to a final volume of 50ul .2.  PCR reaction program: 94 °C, 5 min 94 °C, 30 sec 55 °C, 30 sec 40 cycles 68 °C, 2 min 68 °C, 10 min 1.15k bFor the fragment amplification, P2 and P4 primers are used and the extension proceeding of PCR reaction program should be changed from 68^°C , 2 min to 68^°C , 1 min.3.  Add 10x DNA loading buffer to each sample and mix by pipetting. Purifying the PCR product by running on a 1% agarose gel at 100nu for 30min . Note: The size of gel used here is 6 cm; the voltage/run-time would vary by the gel rig used.C.  Gel extraction of HBV DNA1.  Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination. Briefly place the excised gel slice on absorbent toweling to remove residual buffer. Transfer the gel slice to a piece or plastic wrap or a weighing boat. Mince the gel into small pieces and weigh. In this application, the weight of gel is regarded as equivalent to the volume. For example, 100 mg of gel is equivalent to a 100~ul volume. Transfer the gel slice into a 1.5~ml microfuge tube.Note: Alternatively, the gel slice can be placed into the 1.5 ml microfuge tube and then crushed with a pipette tip or other suitable device. Spin the tube for 30 sec at 12,000x g to consolidate the gel at the bottom of the tube. Use the graduations to estimate the volume of the agarose gel.2.  Add a 3x sample volume of Buffer DE-A. Note: The color of Buffer DE-A is red. This color is used to add contrast in the next step, so that any pieces of unsolubilized agarose can be visualized.3.  Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75~^°C until the gel is completely dissolved (typically, 6-8 m i n ). Heat at 40^°C if low-melt agarose gel is used. Intermittent vortexing (every 2-3m i n ) will accelerate gel solubilization. IMPORTANT: Gel must be completely dissolved or the DNA fragment recovery will be reduced. IMPORTANT: Do not heat the gel for longer than 10 min.4.  Add 0.5x Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B, mix. If the DNA fragment is less than 400b p , supplement further with a 1x sample volume of isopropanol.Example: For a 1% gel slice equivalent to 100ul , add the following: • 300ul Buffer DE-A • 150ul Buffer DE-B If the DNA fragment is <400 bp, you would also add: • 100ul of isopropanolNote: The color of the mixture will turn yellow after the addition of Buffer DE-B. Please make sure the contents are a uniform yellow color before proceeding.5.  Place a Miniprep column into a _2~scriptsize~m~ microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from step C4 into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.6.  Discard the filtrate from the _2m l microfuge tube.

Return the Miniprep column to the 2 ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 sec. Note: Make sure that 95-100% ethanol has been added into Buffer W2 concentrate. Make a notation on the bottle label for future reference.8.  Discard the filtrate from the _2ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the ^2ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700~ul aliquot of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.Note: Two washes with Buffer W2 are used to ensure the complete removal of salt, eliminating potential problems in subsequent enzymatic reactions, such as ligation and sequencing reaction.9.  Discard the filtrate from the _2ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the _2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.10. Transfer the Miniprep column into a clean 1.5~ml microfuge tube (provided). To elute the DNA, add 25-30ul of Eluent or deionized water to the center of the membrane. Let it stand for 1 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min. Notes:a.  Pre-warming the Eluent at 65~^°C will generally improve elution efficiency.b.  Deionized water can also be used to elute the DNA fragments.c.  More detailed information can refer to the PDF protocol file attached here.# D.  Add dATP to generate 3’ overhangs1.  The reaction system to add dATP:()2. Incubate at 72^°C for 30m i n .E.  Integration of HBV DNA into pGEM®-T Vector1.

Add 2 μl IPTG (storage concentration: 20% , m/V_, )  and  20  μl X-gal (storage concentration: 2% , m/V ) and mix by pipetting, then spread the solution on Amp resistance plate (final concentration of Amp: 50ugim/ml) .6.  Put the plate at 37^°C bacteriological incubator for 12-16h .7.  Choose the white clones to get the HBV DNA-integrated plasmid.G. Extract HBV DNA-integrated plasmid from E.coli-DH5α1.  Isolate a single white colony from the plate (step F6), and inoculate a culture of 5~ml LB medium containing the Amp antibiotic. Incubate for 12-16h at 37^°C with vigorous shaking (300r p m) . Use a 10-20 ml culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.2.  Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 1 min at room temperature.3.  Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.4.  Add 250~ul Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields. Note: RNase A must be added to Solution I before use. Please see the instructions (attached here) in the Preparing Reagents section on Page 6.5.  Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.6.  Add 250~ul Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2-3 min incubation may be necessary. Note: Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 min. Store Solution II tightly capped when not in use to avoid acidification from C O_2 in the air.7.  Add 350~ul Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms. Note: It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.8.  Centrifuge at maximum speed (13,000xg) for 10 min. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.9.  Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a _2ml Collection Tube.10. Transfer the cleared supernatant from step G8 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind® DNA Mini Column.

Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.13. Add 500ulH B Buffer.14. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.15. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.16. Add 700ul DNA Wash Buffer. Note: DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with hbar0O% ethanol prior to use. Please see Page 6 (attached here) for instructions.17. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.18. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.19. Centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column for 2 min at maximum speed to drythe column matrix.Note: It is important to dry the HiBind® DNA Mini Column matrix before elution.Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications.20. Transfer the HiBind® DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.21. Add 30-100~ul Elution Buffer or sterile deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.Note: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind® DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH. If using sterile deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.22. Let sit at room temperature for 1 min.23. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Note: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.24.

Animals were fed with veal liver and starved for at least 1 week before beginning experiments.Cloning of hippo and ykiTo amplify the hippo fragment, we used the follow primers: 5′-CGAGCACTGTTTATGATTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTCGGCTTGCAAGTCTGAGTC-3′. To amplify the yorkie fragment, the following primers were used: 5′-GTTTGGATGAATTATTCGAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CACAATACAAAAGAAACCACATGG-3′. hippo and yorkie PCR fragments were cloned into pCRII (Life Technologies) and pGEM-T Easy (Promega) vectors to synthesize dsRNA or ssRNA, as required.RNA interference analysisdsRNA was synthetized by in vitro transcription (Roche) and microinjection performed, as previously described [65], following the standard protocol of 3 × 32 nl injection of dsRNA for 3 consecutive days. To achieve stronger hippo inhibition, we performed the same protocol over 3 consecutive weeks in starved planarians. yorkie (RNAi) animals were injected for only 1 week with injection of gfp during the 2 previous weeks. Regenerating animals were injected with hippo or yorkie dsRNA for 2 weeks prior to amputation of the head and tail. Animals were fixed at different times postamputation, depending on the experiment. Control animals were injected with dsRNA for green fluorescent protein (GFP), a gene not present in planarians.In the h2b/hippo experiment, animals were injected with gfp or h2b on 3 consecutive days and, after 2 rest days, received another injection of gfp or h2b. Beginning the following day, animals were injected with gfp or hippo for 3 consecutive days. Animals were fixed 4 days after the last injection.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from a pool of 5 planarians each for hippo RNAi and gfp RNAi. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as previously described [46], and data were normalized based on the expression of EF2 or URA4 as an internal control. All experiments were performed using 3 biological replicates. The following sets of specific primers were used: hippo mRNA, 5′-TTTGGTCTTTGGGAATCAC-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGAGGTTGAGAAGG-3′; h2b mRNA, 5′-GAGAAAGTTGAACGGCCC-3′ and 5′-AAGATAATACGTACTTCAACGACG-3′.Whole-mount ISH and immunohistochemistryRNA probes were synthesized in vitro using Sp6 or T7 polymerase (Roche) and DIG-, FITC-, or DNP-modified (Perkin Elmer) nucleotides. RNA probes were purified and precipitated with ethanol and 7.5 M ammonium acetate. For ISH and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), animals were fixed and processed as previously described [66,67]. After probe development, neoblasts were visualized with the rabbit anti-SMEDWI-1 antibody (1:1,000; kindly provided by Kerstin Bartscherer, Max Plank Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Münster, Germany) [47]. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:5,000) and mounted with 70% glycerol in PBS.Whole-mount immunostainingImmunostaining was performed as previously described [68]. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-synapsin (anti-SYNORF-1, 1:50; Hybridoma Bank); rabbit anti-phospho-histone-H3-Ser10 (anti-H3P) (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-SMEDWI-1 antibody (1:1,000); mouse anti-arrestin (anti-VC1) (1:15,000; kindly provided by Professor K. Watanabe); rabbit anti-β-catenin-2 (anti-Bcat2) (1:2,000) [41]. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:5,000) and mounted with 70% glycerol in PBS. To avoid technical variance and a reliable quantification of H3P+cells, at least 2 independent experiments were performed.ISH and immunohistochemistry in paraffin sectionsFor ISH and immunohistochemistry, animals were killed and processed as previously described [69]. The antibodies used were rabbit anti-SMEDWI-1 (1:1,000), rabbit anti-phospho-histone-H3-Ser10 (anti-H3P) (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), rat anti-phospho-histone-H3-Ser10 (anti- H3P) (1:1,000; Millipore), and rabbit anti-YORKIE (1:200).Immunohistochemistry in dissociated cellsWhole animals were macerated in a solution containing methanol: glacial acetic acid: glycerol: distilled water (3:1:2:14) for 16 h at 4°C. Cells were transferred onto a slide and immunostained with mouse anti-α-Tubulin (1:500, Sigma) and rabbit anti-phospho-histone-H3-Ser10 (anti- H3P) (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology).Whole-mount TUNEL and caspase-3 activity assayFor TUNEL analysis, animals were fixed and treated as previously described [70], using the ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merck-Millipore Ref.S7165). To avoid technical variance, at least 2 independent TUNEL experiments were performed. For the caspase-3 assay, total protein was extracted from a pool of 5 planarians and processed as previously described [71]. Enzyme activity was measured in a luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer LS-50) (1 excitation, 380 nm). A unit of caspase-3 activity was defined as the amount of active enzyme necessary to produce an increase of 1 arbitrary luminescence unit after a 2-h incubation. The results are presented as units of caspase-3 activity per μg of protein. All experiments were performed using 5 biological and 3 technical replicates for each condition. To avoid technical variance, at least 2 independent experiments were performed.Flow cytometryDissociation of planarians, cell labeling, and isolation of cells by FACS were performed as described previously [72]. Absolute cell counts were performed by adding beads of a known concentration to the sample. Beads and cells were detected simultaneously, and absolute counts of the cells were calculated from bead numbers (absolute counts by indirect method). Flow-Check Fluorospheres Polystyrene Fluorescent Microspheres (Beckman Coulter Inc, Indianapolis, IN) were adjusted at 1 × 106 fluorospheres/mL. A 1:100 dilution of the bead solution was applied to each sample to obtain a final concentration of 1 × 104 beads/mL. Beads and cells were identified according to their distinct patterns of scatter and fluorescence.Edu staining of paraffin sectionsF-ara Edu (32 nl; Sigma) was injected into gfp and hippo (RNAi) animals at a concentration of 60 μg/mL (diluted in 10% DMSO/PAM water). After 16 h, animals were processed and stained with the EdU Click-555 kit (Baseclick Gmbh; BCK-Edu555), in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, following pretreatment with proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for 10 min at RT. Samples were immunostained with anti-H3P, stained with DAPI, and mounted with 70% glycerol in PBS. In the h2b/hippo (RNAi) experiment, animals previously injected with gfp/h2b and/or gfp/hippo were injected with EdU and after 16 h were processed for FISH using the smedwi-1 probe, followed by EdU staining.In vivo PI incorporation analysisAnimals were injected with gfp or hippo over 3 consecutive weeks and then injected with 3 × 32 nl of a mixture of PI (1.66 × 10−3 μg/μL; Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (3.3 × 10−6 μg/μL; Sigma) diluted in PAM water. Immediately, planarians were soaked in the same solution for 4 h. Single planarians were placed on a microscopy slide and enveloped in a drop of 3% low melting agarose. Confocal imaging was performed within minutes of preparation of the samples.Generation of the anti-YORKIE polyclonal antibodyThe complete coding sequence of yorkie cDNA was cloned into a p-GEMT Easy vector (Promega). Subcloning, protein expression, and antibody production were performed using ProteoGenix (ProteoGenix, France). Briefly, 200 μg of recombinant protein was used as an immunogen to produce polyclonal IgGs in 2 rabbits. The postimmunization serum was purified using protein A affinity purification, precipitated in sodium azide buffer, and stored at 4°C.Western blot assayProtein extracts were obtained as previously described [73]. After incubation with rabbit anti-YORKIE (1:2,000) and mouse anti-α-TUBULIN (1:10,000; Sigma) antibodies, the signal was developed using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad) and chemiluminescence was detected using a C-DiGit Chemiluminescent Western Blot Scanner (LI-COR). Quantifications were performed with Image Studio Lite and normalized to the anti-α-Tubulin signal.Transcriptomic analysisFor transcriptomic analysis, total RNA was extracted from gfp (RNAi) and hippo (RNAi) animals after 1, 3, or 4 weeks of inhibition. Three replicates were generated per condition from a pool of 5 organisms each. RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and quality assessment performed by capillary electrophoresis in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) prior to preparation of the library. cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced as paired-end reads in an Illlumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. Quality assessment of the reads was performed using the FastQC suite. Transcript abundances were calculated with kallisto v0.43.0 [74] on the S. mediterranea dd_Smed_v6 transcriptome assembly [75]. Differential expression analysis was carried out using the sleuth [76] and DESeq2 [77] statistical packages. Raw sequencing data in FASTQ format as well as the transcript abundances have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [78] and are accessible using GEO Series accession number GSE95130.ImagingFISH and immunostaining samples were imaged using a MZ16F stereomicroscope (Leica) equipped with a ProgRes C3 camera (Jenoptik) or an SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica). Images were processed using Fiji and Photoshop CS5 (Adobe) software. Brightness/contrast and color balance adjustments were always applied to the entire image. Quantifications were performed by hand using the “multi-point selection” tool of Fiji. Colocalization quantification was performed using the equivalent areas using the “ROI-manager” tool in Fiji. Nuclear area in Edu and IP experiments was measured using the “threshold” tool with the “moments” mask for all samples. Signal quantification of Yorkie antibody immunostaining was processed using Fiji software. Two planes were used to build the Z-projection. Nuclear-stained (DAPI) images were transformed into a mask using the “threshold” tool with the “moments” mask. The mask was used to obtain the nuclear signal with the Image calculator process. The nuclear signal obtained from the resulting image was measured to obtain the raw integrated density (RID). The nuclear area was obtained from the mask. Next, the RID was normalized to the respective nuclear area. Results were averaged per group and significant differences determined by 2-tailed Student t test.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5794332.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Bacterial Intracellular Sodium Ion Measurement using CoroNa Green","text":"Bacterial Intracellular Sodium Ion Measurement using CoroNa Green\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes\n2.

Tetracycline-inducible control vector (TET-RFP) was purchased from Open Biosystems. Expression constructs: vGPCR was cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites; and Rac1QL (constitutively active) and Rac1N17 (dominant negative) were cloned into pcDNA3 using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. PDGFB-Luc construct was cloned from a 450 bp fragment of the human PDGFB promoter and cloned into pGL2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using KpnI and HindIII restriction sites as previously described [57].Superoxide detectionDHE (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) staining was done as previously [35]. Briefly, serum-starved cells were incubated with DHE/HBSS at 10 μM for 30 min in a CO2 incubator at 37°C (dark conditions), in the presence of growth factors and inhibitors if required. Cells were then washed 3 times with HBSS and images in the red channel were taken using a Zeiss ApoTome Axiovert 200M microscope.Luciferase reporter assayHEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were assessed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)RNA was isolated with RNeasy Plus Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) with on-column DNase treatment. 500 ng of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with SybrGreen PCR Master Mix (Quanta Biosciences). The following primer sets were used: GAPDH (5'-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3', 5'-CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC-3'); LANA (5'-CCTGGAAGTCCCACAGTGTT-3', 5'-AGACACAGGATGGGATGGAG-3'); c-Myc (5'-CAACGTCTTGGAACGTCAGA-3', 5'-TCGTCTGCTTGAATGGACAG-3'); VEGFA (5'-AGCACAGCAGATGTGAATGC-3', 5'-AATGCTTTCTCCGCTCTGAA-3'). In every run, melting curve analysis was performed to verify specificity of products as well as water and–RT controls. Data were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method as previously described [21]. Target gene expression was normalized to GAPDH by taking the difference between CT values for target genes and GAPDH (ΔCT value). These values were then calibrated to the control sample to give the ΔΔCT value. The fold target gene expression is given by the formula: 2–ΔΔCT.Rac1 activity assaySerum-starved mECK36 cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB (40 ng/mL) for 10 min. Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864 (50 μM) was added to culture media 10 min before PDGF stimulation. Rac1 pull-down assays were performed using the Rac1 Activation Assay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with GST-agarose beads for 20 min at 4°C. After removal of GST-beads, lysates were incubated at 4°C for 60 min with p21-activated kinase 1-binding domain (PBD)-agarose beads, then washed four times with MLB buffer and resuspended in 2x Laemmli buffer and resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. GST-PBD bound active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) was detected by immunoblotting using a specific antibody against Rac1. Total Rac1 was detected by immunoblotting in samples from corresponding cell lysates.Immunofluorescence stainingImmunostaining was performed as previously described [21]. Briefly, cells and frozen sections from tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X/PBS for 20 min at 4°C. After blocking with 10% FBS/PBS for 60 min, samples were incubated with anti-CD31 (1:200 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and anti-VEGFR3 (1:200 dilution, ImClone, New York, NY), anti-phospho-PDGFRA (1:30 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) antibodies for 1 hour. After PBS washing, samples were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 for 1 hr (1:500 dilution, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), washed and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Images were taken using a Zeiss ApoTome Axiovert 200M microscope. Image quantification was performed with Image (NIH). Immunohistochemistry staining of human KS biopsies were made on discard pathological material.Western blottingProtein concentrations in cell and tumor lysates were quantified using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 20 μg of proteins were mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk/PBS for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies (4°C, 16 hrs). After 3 TBS/Tween washes, membranes were incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution, Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 hr at room temperature. Protein bands were developed using ECL Plus Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and quantified by densitometry with QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). To analyze multiple proteins on the same membrane, membranes were washed with Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to manufacturer’s protocol.Animal studiesAll mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions. Tumor studies were done in 4- to 6- week-old nude mice obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection of mECK36 cells (3 x 105 cells) as previously described [21]. A group of mice was treated with 40 mM N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in drinking water 2 weeks after tumor inoculation (preventive modality) or when tumors were already established (treatment modality)[35] (see Fig legends). This NAC regimen assumes that the steady-state concentration of NAC is 9.2 mM or 1.5 g/L NAC for a 20 g mouse [58]. The control group received regular drinking water without NAC. Imatinib was administered at 150 mg/Kg/twice daily by oral gavage every 12 hrs [59] with a 200 μl volume per animal using 20 gauge gavage needles (Cadence Science, Lake Success, NY). Sunitinib was administered at a 80 mg/Kg/day dose by oral gavage, with a 200 μl volume per animal using 20 gauge gavage needles (Cadence Science). Placebo animals received the same volume of vehicle. Tumor volumes were measured using a caliper every 2 days and calculated using the following formula: [length (mm) × width (mm)2× 0.52][57].Clinical tissue microarrays analysis70 skin KS biopsies and controls were analyzed from an ACSR (The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource) tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry of clinical tissue microarrays was performed using a standard protocol of the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Miami. Antibody staining of p-PDGFRA from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) was diluted to 1:30 and LANA from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) was diluted 1:40. The expression of p-PDGFRA and LANA were classified into three levels depending on the signal strength.Statistical analysisStatistical significance of the data was determined using two-tailed Student’s t-test. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Unistat Statistical Package for Microsoft Excel. All values were expressed as means ± standard deviation.Ethics statementThe animal experiments have been performed under UM IACUC approval number 13–093. The University of Miami has an Animal Welfare Assurance on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health. Additionally, UM is registered with USDA APHIS.

SPSS 15.0 for Windows® (LEAD Technologies Inc.)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nA major requirement for this protocol is to experimentally establish the optimum concentration of CFW or CR to be used. This may be influenced by several parameters, including size of the inoculum, genetic background of the strains and composition of the growth medium. The wild type strain used in our laboratory was Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (strain 4287/FGSC 9935). Appropriate CFW and CR concentration should be sublethal for the wild-type or reference strain used in the experiment. We typically define this parameter by inoculating serial dilutions of conidia in the form of spots on plates containing CFW and CR, with concentrations in the range of 10200 u9/ m I of CFW and 5600 u9/ m1 of CR.1.  Production of fresh microconidia (3-4 d) Inoculate 50ul of a -80^°C stock microconidial suspension (in 30% glycerol) into 50 ml of liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB) (see Recipe 1). Grow cultures for 3-4 d at 28~°0 with shaking at 170 rpm (Di Pietro and Roncero, 1998). Filter microconidia through one layer of Miracloth, centrifuge and wash with sterile water. Count conidia using a Neubauer chamber and adjust to a final concentration of 1×10^7 conidia/ml.2.  Preparation of stock solutions of CFW (20m g/m l) and CR (50m g/m l) (1 h) (see Recipe 2)3.  Preparation of growth medium (1-2 h) Prepare growth agar medium and autoclave (20 min at 120 ^°C_A ). Cool the medium down to 50- 60^°C in a water bath before adding CR and CFW to avoid any potentially harming fumes. Then, add CFW or CR to reach the desired concentrations. This can be done in a laminar flow hood. For F. oxysporum, we suggest to start by testing 4-5 different dye concentrations, in the following range: 10 to 200u/ml for CFW and 10 to 600u/ml for CR. Additionally, prepare a control plate without the dyes. The plates can be stored overnight, at room temperature and in the dark, to be used the next day.4.  Preparation of a serial dilution of microconidia (1-2 h) Prepare a 10-fold serial dilution of freshly-obtained microconidia starting with the 1 × 10^7 conidia/ml stock solution generated in step 1 (1×10^7,1×10^6, 1×10^5 and 1×10^4 conidial/ml). Inoculate 2~ul drops of this series on plates containing CFW or CR and a control plate (final concentrations: 2×10^4,2×10^3,2×10^2 and 2 x 10 conidia/ml). We typically use square ( 120~× 120m m_ ) Petri dishes, to allow sufficient space for growth of the fungal colonies.5.  Incubation of plates (2-3 d) Incubate plates at 28~^°C in the dark for ^2-3textupd .6.  Interpreting and monitoring resultsa.  Sensitivity to CFW and CR should be determined by comparing the extent of colony formation of parental and mutant strains in control and CFW or CR plates. Colony diameter may be measured for quantification of differences in colony growth of the strains tested. For this, inoculate each single strain (a 5~ul drop of a 1×10^7 microconidia/ml suspension) on the control and cell wall stress plates, with 5 replicates each. We use round ( igcirc0m m diameter) Petri dishes. Incubate the plates at 28^°C for 5 d before scanning and measuring colony diameter.b.  Data from three independent experiments, each with five replicates, can then be analyzed with a statistic software such as SPSS 15.0 for Windows®. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney test are used to assess statistically relevant differences among strains at Peq0.05 .\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction and Preparation\nExperimentally establish the optimum concentration of CFW or CR to be used, considering parameters such as inoculum size, genetic background of strains, and composition of the growth medium.\nDefine the sublethal concentration for the wild-type or reference strain used in the experiment by inoculating serial dilutions of conidia on plates containing CFW and CR.\n## Production of Fresh Microconidia\nInoculate 50ul of a -80°C stock microconidial suspension into 50 ml of liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB).\nGrow cultures for 3-4 days at 28°C with shaking at 170 rpm.\nFilter microconidia through one layer of Miracloth, centrifuge, and wash with sterile water.\nCount conidia using a Neubauer chamber and adjust to a final concentration of 1×10^7 conidia/ml.\n## Preparation of Stock Solutions and Growth Medium\nPrepare stock solutions of CFW (20mg/ml) and CR (50mg/ml).\nPrepare growth agar medium and autoclave for 20 minutes at 120°C.\nCool the medium to 50-60°C in a water bath before adding CR and CFW.\nAdd CFW or CR to reach the desired concentrations, starting with 4-5 different dye concentrations for F. oxysporum.\n## Preparation of Serial Dilution of Microconidia and Inoculation\nPrepare a 10-fold serial dilution of freshly obtained microconidia starting with the 1×10^7 conidia/ml stock solution.\nInoculate 2ul drops of the serial dilution on plates containing CFW or CR and a control plate.\nUse square (120×120mm) Petri dishes to allow sufficient space for growth of the fungal colonies.\n## Incubation and Monitoring\nIncubate plates at 28°C in the dark for 2-3 days.\nMonitor and interpret results by comparing the extent of colony formation of parental and mutant strains in control and CFW or CR plates.\n## Data Analysis\nMeasure colony diameter for quantification of differences in colony growth of the strains tested.\nAnalyze data from three independent experiments, each with five replicates, using statistical software such as SPSS 15.0 for Windows.\nUse Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney test to assess statistically relevant differences among strains at P≤0.05.","keywords":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1915"}}

AHA was prepared as described51. ANL was prepared as described for AHA via copper-catalysed diazo transfer51. Briefly, Nα-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-lysine was converted to Boc-protected ANL using the azidification reagent triflic azide. The free amino acid was obtained on treatment with acid and was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Biotin-alkyne tag (biotin-polyethylene oxide (PEO)-propargylamide) was synthesized as described15.For western blots, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against biotin (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) and GFP (Abcam) were used both at 1:10,000 and mouse monoclonal antibodies (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) against Dlg (4F3), synapsin (3C11), Draper (8A1) and Notch (C17.9C6) were applied at 1:500. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:7,500. For immunofluorescent labelling, mouse monoclonal antibodies (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) against Dlg (4F3), Brp (NC82) and FasII (1F4) were used at 1:500, 1:100 or 1:10, respectively. Rabbit anti-PMCA (plasma membrane calcium ATPase, U.T., unpublished observations) was used at 1:2,000. Dye-conjugated secondary antibodies from goat or donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-HRP-Cy5 were used at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).Transgenic constructs and fliesThe coding sequence of mMetRS was PCR amplified from I.M.A.G.E complementary DNA (cDNA) clone 6416029 (GenBank ID BC079643) using 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCACCATGAGACTGTTCGTGAG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CGGAATTCCTTTTTCTTCTTGCCTTTAGGAGTT-3′ as reverse primer. The PCR product was inserted as a XhoI–EcoRI fragment into pEGFP-N2 and the resultant mMetRSwt-EGFP fusion was cloned as a XhoI–AflII fragment in between the respective sites of the fly transformation vector pUAST. A PCR strategy was applied to the original cDNA to generate mMetRSL274G. The above primers were used in PCRs with the reverse primer 5′-TCACCAGTGCCGGCCCCTATGTCA-3′ or the antiparallel primer 5′-TGACATAGGGGCCGGCACTGGTGA-3′, respectively, both covering the desired mutation. The overlapping PCR fragments were annealed to each other and thereupon used as a template to PCR amplify the coding sequence for mMetRSL274G using the outer forward and reverse primers. Subsequent cloning steps were carried out as for mMetRSwt. To generate dMetRSL262G, we first introduced the respective mutation into an exon fragment amplified from the dMetRS locus (CG15100) of a wild-type fly according to the two-step PCR strategy described above. Specifically, the mutating primers 5′-CATCACCTCGGCGGGTCCCTATGTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGACATAGGGACCCGCCGAGGTGATG-3′ were used with outer primers 5′-GGAAGTTCTTGCCGAACAGCCAC-3′ or 5′-CAAAGCCAATGCCGAACCAGCG-3′, respectively. A 375-bp BsmBI–ScaI subfragment of this PCR product was used to substitute the corresponding part in the dMetRS cDNA clone AT05114 (Drosophila genomics resource center; GenBank ID AY119445), thereby introducing the mutation and repairing an unwanted missense mutation (A232T). We also noticed that the cDNA lacked 30 bp encoding His820 to Glu829 (not related to canonical splicing) and therefore used a PCR-derived 215-bp BstEII genomic fragment to replace the respective fragment in the cDNA. However, both the corrected and the Δ30 bp versions of dMetRSL262G were later found to efficiently incorporate ANL. To allow C-terminal fusions with EGFP or a 3 × myc-epitope, the stop codon was removed in a PCR reaction on the cDNA using primers 5′-GTTGATAAACCGAGAGCTGCGTG-3′ and 5′-TGTCGACTTCTTCTTTTTGCCCTTG-3′. The SalI site in the latter primer served for in-frame cloning into pEGFP-N1 in a three-fragment ligation involving the vector cut with EcoRI and SalI, an EcoRI–NcoI fragment from the L262G-mutated cDNA and the NcoI–SalI fragment from the latter PCR product. To obtain the epitope-tagged version, the EGFP sequence was replaced by a 3xmyc fragment flanked by SalI and NotI sites, derived from a PCR on a 3xmyc-tagged dlg construct (U.T., unpublished observations). The fusion genes were eventually cloned as EcoRI–NotI fragments into pUAST. Following germline injections at BestGene Inc. (CA, USA) individual lines were established for each construct. On testing various lines, the following MetRS effector strains were used throughout this study: UAS-mMetRSwtEGFP/(CyO) (line 6202-1), UAS-mMetRSL274G-EGFP/(TM6b,Tb Hu) (line 6202-2), UAS-dMetRSL262G-EGFP/(TM6b,Tb Hu) (line 2.1), UAS-dMetRSL262G-3xmyc/(CyO) (line 3.4).FliesUnless stated otherwise stocks and crosses were grown at 25 °C in a 14 h/10 h dark–light cycle on Otto normal medium (ONM) containing Agar–Agar (0.83% w/v), mashed raisins (4% w/v), yeast (6% w/v), semolina (5% w/v), sugar beet syrup (2.6% w/v), honey (2.6% w/v) and Nipagin (0.13% (v/v). Dominant markers associated with balancer chromosomes, CyO, CyOact-GFP and TM6b, Tb Hu, were used to establish transgenic and recombinant lines and to identify genotypes of progeny at larval and adult stages in crosses of heterozygous flies. All Gal4 activator strains have been described as folllowing: elavC155-Gal4 (pan-neuronal52), repo-Gal4 (glia-specific53), OK371-Gal4 (motoneuronal54), C57-Gal4 (muscle specific55), ptc559.1-Gal4 (subregional in imaginal discs56) and ubi-Gal4 (all cell types, obtained from Bloomington stock center).Metabolic labelling of proteins with ANLAHA was supplied at 4 mM, whereas ANL was supplied at 2, 4 or 8 mM (as indicated) in the food. For long-term labelling, crosses were continuously reared on AHA- or ANL-containing medium and offspring analysed at larval stage L3 or as adults. To assess shorter labelling time windows in adult flies, crosses were reared on ONM and adult offspring were transferred onto 4 mM ANL-containing ONM 0 to 3 days post eclosion and analysed for ANL incorporation after 24 and 48 h. To investigate short-term metabolic labelling in larvae, 2-h egg collections were performed and larvae were raised on Jazz-Mix Drosophila food (Fisher Scientific) at 25 °C. Three groups were defined that were first raised on normal food and then transferred to 4 mM ANL-containing food; group A: 72 h w/o ANL/48 h with ANL; group B: 96 h w/o ANL/24 h with ANL; and group C: 108 h w/o ANL/12 h with ANL.Toxicity test of ANL to Drosophila larvae and fliesTo test any putative toxicity of ANL to Drosophila larvae, the body weight of wandering L3 stage larvae was determined using an ultra fine scale (Sartorius). Body weights of either dMetRSL262G-EGFP- or mMetRSL274G-EGFP-expressing larvae were compared between larvae reared on ONM with 2, 4 and 8 mM ANL or without ANL. Data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett post hoc tests. To test for a linear relationship between ANL incorporation and larval body weight, linear regression analyses were performed. To analyse any putative toxicity of ANL to adult Drosophila flies, five virgin female flies of the driver strain (either elavC155-Gal4 or repo-Gal4) were crossed with five male flies of the UAS strain (either UAS-dMetRSL262G-EGFP or UAS-mMetRSL274G-EGFP) and reared on ONM with 2, 4 and 8 mM ANL or without ANL. Parental flies were removed from the offspring before reaching the pupal stage. After hatching of the first offspring generation flies (∼10–11 days after the crossing was started), the number of offspring was counted every second day and compared between the different groups expressing either dMetRSL262G-EGFP or mMetRSL274G-EGFP versus flies not expressing dMetRSL262G-EGFP or mMetRSL274G-EGFP. To determine the metamorphosis and eclosion rate of ANL-incorporating flies, we compared the group size relative with the segregation after Mendel's law (expressing either dMetRSL262G-EGFP or mMetRSL274G-EGFP) reared either on ONM with 2, 4 and 8 mM ANL or without ANL. Statistical analyses were performed using one sample t-tests against a theoretical mean of 1.0. To investigate the correlation between ANL incorporation and eclosion rate, linear regression analysis with a 95% confidence interval was performed.Investigation of the survival rate of MetRSLtoG-EGFP-expressing flies was performed by crossing virgin female flies of different driver strains (elavC155-Gal4 or repo-Gal4) to male flies of the UAS strain (either UAS-dMetRSL262G-EGFP, UAS-mMetRSL274G-EGFP), rearing them either on ONM with 2, 4 or 8 mM, or on ONM without ANL. At 0–3 days post eclosion, 10 flies each (five female and five male) were transferred either to ONM with the same as previous ANL concentration (for example, 2 mM ANL—2 mM ANL) or to ONM without ANL (for example, 2 mM ANL—w/o ANL). Over a total period of 14 days, the number of living flies was determined every other day.Click chemistry (CuAAC) and detection of tagged proteinsVisualization of ANL- or AHA-labelled proteins using FUNCAT. Larval body walls were dissected in haemolymph-like 3 (HL-3) solution (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.2) with 0.1 mM Ca2+ and pre-fixed with two to three drops of 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1 × PB (phosphate buffer, 0.1 M Na2HPO4, 0.1 M NaH2PO4) pH 7.2) for 1 min. After exchanging the solution to 4% paraformaldehyde in PB pH 7.2 body walls were incubated for 30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation. Following fixation, body walls were washed three times with PBT (phosphate buffer red saline pH 7.2+0.2% v/v Triton X-100) and another three times with 1 × PBS pH 7.8 (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4) both for 15 min each at room temperature under gentle agitation. ANL-labelled proteins were tagged by mixing triazole ligand (TBTA, Sigma-Aldrich; 200 mM in dimethylsulfoxide; 1:1,000), TAMRA-alkyne tag (Invitrogen; 1 mM; 1:5,000) or Atto647N alkyne tag (ATTO-TEC GmbH; 1 mM; 1:5,000), tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine solution (Sigma-Aldrich; 400 mM; 1:1,000) and CuSO4 solution (Sigma-Aldrich; 200 mM; 1:1,000) in 1 × PBS pH 7.8. After each addition, the solution was mixed thoroughly for 10 s using a high-speed vortexer. Body walls were incubated with 200 μl of this mixture overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Subsequently, body walls were washed three times with 1 × PBS–Tween (PBS pH 7.4+1% v/v Tween-20) and PBT for 15 min each at room temperature under gentle agitation before incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Motor nerve terminals were stained with a primary anti-HRP-Cy5 antibody (1:200 in PBT) for 1 h at room temperature. After immunostaining, body walls were washed once more three times for 15 min each with PBT at room temperature under gentle agitation. Finally, body walls were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) and stored at 4 °C until imaging.For analysis of short-term labelling by FUNCAT, larvae were reared on Jazz-Mix Drosophila medium as described in the section Metabolic labelling of proteins with ANL. Fixation and FUNCAT reaction were carried out as described above.Identification of AHA- and ANL-labelled proteins using BONCAT. Protein extraction was performed either from larval body walls (final amount of 2.5–3.5 mg), from 60 larval brains, or from 20 heads of adult Drosophila flies. Body walls or larval brains were dissected in HL-3 solution with 0.1 mM Ca2+. Drosophila heads were collected after anaesthetizing flies with CO2 by cropping heads from the body. Body walls, larval brains or fly heads were transferred to glass homogenizers (Wheaton). Protein extraction was carried out by homogenizing body walls, larval brains or fly heads in 100 μl 0.5% SDS in 1 × PBS pH 7.8–2 × protease inhibitor (PI, Roche) w/o EDTA+Benzonase (Sigma, ≥250 units per μl) per 2.5–3.5 mg of body wall material, per 60 larval brains or per 20 fly heads. Homogenates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature under permanent agitation before boiling at 95 °C for 7 min. After cooling down on ice, 20% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and homogenates were diluted with 1 × PBS, pH 7.8, 2 × PI w/o EDTA to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. After an incubation for 1 h at 4 °C under permanent agitation, lysates were spun down at 3,000g, 5 min, 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (‘lysates') were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and ANL- or AHA-labelled proteins were tagged by adding triazol ligand (Sigma-Aldrich, 200 mM in dimethylsulfoxide; 1:1,000), biotin-PEO3-alkyne tag (25 mM; 1:1,000) and copper(I)bromid suspension (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg ml−1; 1:100). After each addition, the solution was mixed thoroughly for 10 s using a high-speed vortexer. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C under permanent agitation. Subsequently, samples were spun down at 3,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred onto ZEBA desalting spin columns (Thermo Scientific) to remove excess CuAAC reagents. Desalting was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations between samples were adjusted to the same concentration via amidoblack assay. ANL-labelled proteins were purified using high-capacity NeutrAvidin agarose (Thermo Scientific). For this, a defined volume of high-capacity NeutrAvidin agarose suspension was equilibrated with three washes of 1 ml 1% (v/v) Igepal in 1 × PBS, pH 7.8 each, inverting the tube several times and a subsequent centrifugation step (3,000g, 5 min, 4 °C). Tagged lysates were incubated with 1% Igepal for at least 20 min at 4 °C under permanent agitation. Lysates were then incubated with NeutrAvidin agarose overnight at 4 °C under permanent agitation. Afterwards, the supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. NeutrAvidin agarose was washed five times for 5 min each with 1% (v/v) Igepal in 1 × PBS, pH 7.8 and three times for 5 min each with 1 × PBS, pH 7.8 as described above. ANL-labelled biotin-tagged proteins were eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer (0.5 volume of the suspension volume) for 7 min at 95 °C. Eluates were collected after a centrifugation step, transferred to new tubes and processed for western and dot blot analysis as described15. Uncropped scans of crucial western blots are included as Supplementary Fig. 12.Microscopy and statistical analysesImages of larval body wall muscles, central nervous system and imaginal discs were acquired on a Leica-SP5 confocal microscope. Images of time course experiment were acquired using an AxioObserver.Z1 microscope equipped with a LSM 700 confocal unit (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Original confocal data and images were processed using the ZEN2010 software (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) and the FigureJ plugin for FIJI software57 (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, Madison, USA). Identical confocal settings were used for all comparative analyses including image acquisition of motor neuron cell clusters for FUNCAT time course experiments. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using FIJI software57. For quantification, mean intensities of all cells within one cluster from each central nervous system were taken as a single biological replicate (n=10–11). For statistical analysis, Mann–Whitney U-test was used, because the data were not normally distributed. *P≤0.05, **P≤0.01, ***P≤0.001; 12 versus 24 h: P=0.001530673=**; 12 versus 48 h: P=1.08E−04=***; 24 versus 48 h: ***P=9.34E−05.Purification of EGFP-tagged dMetRSL262G for MS analysisBody walls of 16 C57-Gal4/ UAS-dMetRSL262G-EGFP, ANL-fed (ONM with 4 mM ANL) third instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold HL-3 solution as described under section Click chemistry (CuAAC) and detection of tagged proteins. The μMACS isolation kit (Mylteni Biotec) was used in combination with μMACS anti-GFP microbeads according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins were isolated using 400 μl lysis buffer (2 × PI w/o extra EDTA) provided in the kit and mixed with 80 μl μMACS anti-GFP beads. Following incubation on ice for 1 h the suspension was loaded onto a μMACS column, pre-equilibrated with 200 μl lysis buffer. The flow through was collected as a control. After five washes EGFP-tagged proteins were eluted in two elution steps with subsequent pooling of the two eluate fractions using the elution buffer recommended in the manufacturer's protocol but without EDTA. Eluted fractions (100 μl) were separated on 10% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide (SDS-PAA) gels (1.5 mm) and silver stained according to a modified protocol58. Corresponding bands at 130 kDa were cut out and destained using 50 mM sodiumthiosulfatepentahydrate (Na2S2O5 5H2O, AppliChem) and 15 mM potassium cyanoferrate (C6FeK3N6, Sigma).Proteins in the gel pieces were reduced with 2.8 mM dithiothreitol (60 °C for 30 min), modified with 8.8 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (in the dark, room temperature for 30 min) and digested in 10% acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium bicabonate with modified trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C. A second digestion was carried out for 4 h.Mass spectrometry analysisThe peptides were resolved by reverse phase chromatography on 0.075 × 200-mm fused silica capillaries (J&W) packed with Reprosil reversed phase material (Dr Maisch GmbH, Germany). The peptides were eluted with linear 94-min gradients of 5–28% and 12 min at 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in water at flow rates of 0.15 μl min−1. Mass spectrometry was performed by Q-Exactive plus (Thermo) mass spectrometer in a positive mode using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision induces dissociation (HCD) of the 10 most dominant ions selected from the first MS scan.The mass spectrometry data were analysed by the Proteome Discoverer software version 1.4 using the Sequest search engine versus the Drosophila section of the Uniprot database with 1% false discovery rate and specific database containing the dMetRSL262G-EGFP sequence.Behavioural assaysVirgin driver line females (30–100; elavC155-Gal4, C57-Gal4) were crossed with half the number of heterozygous UAS-MetRSLtoG-EGFP line males and raised on ONM or 4 mM ANL-containing ONM (chronic ANL feeding). The number of males and females per cross was the same for groups that were compared. After 3–6 days, the parental generation was transferred onto fresh ONM with or without 4 mM ANL. Another 4–6 days later the parental generation was disposed. Zero to four days (chronic) or 0–3 days (acute) post eclosion the progeny of a cross was CO2 anaesthetized and the UAS-MetRSLtoG-EGFP-positive flies or wild-type flies were sexed, collected in groups of 10 flies per vial, and placed onto fresh ONM or 4 mM ANL-containing ONM. In chronic or acute ANL-feeding experiments, flies were tested 18- or 48-h later, respectively.For larval behavioural analyses after acute ANL feeding, crosses were reared on ONM for 1–2 days and transferred onto fresh ONM for 4–6 h. After 72±2 h at 25 °C, the larvae were washed out of the food with warm tap water and rinsed into a mesh basket before being transferred onto ONM or 4 mM ANL-containing ONM with a brush. Another 24 h later, the larvae were tested in the larval crawling assay. We adopted our protocol for the larval crawling assay from ref. 35. Ten UAS-MetRSLtoG-EGFP-expressing third instar larvae of a certain group were centred on a 2% agarose (Biozym) containing Petri dish over 0.2 cm2 grid graph paper and videotaped. The number of grid lines each larva crossed within 1 min was determined and a mean was taken from the values for the 10 larvae. The progeny of at least three independent crosses was analysed. Student's t-tests were used to test for statistical differences in crawling behaviour between larvae raised on ONM and larvae raised on 4 mM ANL-containing ONM.We adopted our protocol for rapid iterative negative geotaxis assay from refs 35. A climbing apparatus was generated by placing an empty polystyrene vial (25 × 95 mm, VWR) with a circle mark at 8 cm from the bottom onto the fly-containing food vial. The two vials were fixed with tape. The flies were allowed to acclimatize to this setting for >5 min. The number of flies that passed the 8-cm mark within 10 s after being tapped to the bottom of the vial was recorded. This procedure was repeated 10 times with an inter-trial interval of 3 min and a mean was taken from these measurements (counted as one replicate) for each group. The progeny of at least three independent crosses was analysed. Student's t-tests were used to test for statistical differences in climbing behaviour between flies raised on ONM and flies fed on 4 mM ANL-containing ONM. There were no differences between male and female performances. Therefore, the data were pooled.We adopted our protocol for the island assay from ref. 37. Flies were videotaped while released on a 12.7 × 8.5 cm2 platform (island) in the middle of a watery soap bath (31.2 × 15 cm2). We analysed the percentage of flies jumping, running, sitting, or flying after being released on the platform (Student's t-tests) and determined the time needed to clear the platform. Differences in the time to clear the platform between flies reared on ONM or on 4 mM ANL-containing ONM were analysed with repeated measurement ANOVAs. There were no differences between male and female performances. Therefore, the data was pooled.We adopted our protocol for ethanol sensitivity from ref. 38. Vials (25 × 95 mm, VWR) containing 10 flies were sealed with a 1 ml 97% ethanol (Fisher, stained with commercially available blue food dye) moistened plugs. The flies were videotaped for 20 min. The number of mobile flies was determined every minute. We analysed resistance to ethanol intoxication by comparing the number of mobile flies over the time course of 20 min (repeated measurement ANOVAs) and by comparing half-maximal sedation (ST50, Student's t-tests) of ANL-treated and untreated flies. There were no differences between male and female performances. Therefore, the data were pooled.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC4507001.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Flow Cytometric Quantification of Fatty Acid Uptake by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Macrophages","text":"Flow Cytometric Quantification of Fatty Acid Uptake by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Macrophages\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Bacterial cultureMycobacterium tuberculosis strains are grown at 37~^°C in 7H9 OADC media (see Recipes) in standing culture in T25 flasks until mid-log phase (O D_6000.6) . Bacterial cultures are started from frozen stocks and maintained for no more than 5 passages. Constitutive expression of fluorescent protein by Mtb is required for further detection. We used Mtb Erdman strains with an integrated pMV306 plasmid expressing mCherry from smyc promoter (smyc’::mCherry). This plasmid confers kanamycin resistance, therefore growth media contains kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 mu g/m l (see Recipes).a.  Do not grow more than 10 ml of bacterial culture in a T25 flask to ensure sufficient amount of oxygen available to Mtb. To estimate timing for bacterial culture growth, consider that Mtb divides approximately once in two days when grown in standing culture. More details on bacterial culture growth for macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).b.  We advise testing your wild type strain constitutively expressing fluorescent protein for ability to efficiently intake Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection by microscopy. We havenoticed that in Mtb Erdman strain expression of mCherry under strong promoter (smyc’ or hsp60’) from replicating plasmid impacts Bodipy-palmitate uptake. However CDC1551 strain with the same plasmid demonstrated high level of fatty acid uptake. Additionally, care should be taken to determine by confocal microscopy if Bodipy-palmitate accumulates within bacteria versus on their surface.# B.  Macrophage isolation and culturingMacrophages of various origins can be used. We differentiated macrophages from bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice and maintained in BMDM media (see Recipes) with antibiotics at 37~^°C and 6.0% C O_2 for 10 days before infection.# Infection1.  The day before infection seed macrophages in antibiotic-free BMDM media into T150 tissue culture flasks angle3×10^7 cells and 40-50~ml of BMDM media per flask) to obtain confluent monolayers. If macrophages are of limited numbers one T75 flask with 1×10^7 cells would provide sufficient results, however, two T150 flasks angle6×10^7 cells) would give easily detectable pellet of bacteria at the end of the experiment.2.  On the day of infection measure optical density of mid-log Mtb culture. Assuming that O D_600 of 0.6 equals 10^8 bacteria/ml, centrifuge required amount of culture at 3,300 rpm (2,500× g) for 12 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. We infect macrophages at MOI of 4:1, therefore to infect 6×10^7 cells we need 2.4×10^8 bacteria. To ensure that sufficient numbers of bacteria are pelleted we routinely centrifuge 3ml of bacteria at O D_600=0.6 . Notes: As estimation of bacterial numbers may vary, one may want to determine it on their own. However, to achieve higher replicability in terms of MOI, we advise adhering to our estimation. More details on macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).3.  Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1.5ml of BUB (see Recipes). Pass bacterial suspension through a 1m tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle 12-20 times the same syringe and needle. Add 3.5 m l of BUB to the suspension to obtain 5m in total and mix thoroughly.4.  Add 2.4~ml of bacterial suspension to each T150 flask containing 3×10^7 cells. Mix well, but gently. Incubate at 37~^°C and 6% C O_2 for 4h .5.  Remove extracellular bacteria by replacing with fresh pre-warmed antibiotic free BMDM media. Infected macrophages are maintained in BMDM medium at 37~^°C and 6% C O_2 for 3 days. Changing media on the second day of infection is optional.# Labeling1.  On the day of labeling (third day of infection) pre-warm sterile 1% fatty acid-free BSA (see Recipes) in PBS at 37~^°C for 30-60 min. Add 4 mM stock of Bodipy-palmitate (see Recipes) to obtain 100~uM concentration. For labeling one T75 flask add 50~ul of 4m M Bodipy-palmitatestock to 1.95ml of 1% fatty acid-free BSA. Mix well by vortexing until the solution turns green.Keep at 37~^°C and protect from light.# Notes:a.  The day of labeling can be chosen with consideration of the questions you are trying to address. We tested uptake of Bodipy-palmitate at various stages of macrophage infection, and noted that before the third day of infection the uptake levels are not sufficient to be detected. b.  In addition to Bodipy-palmitate, we have tested Bodipy FL C12 and Bodipy 558/568 C12. Bodipy FL C12 accumulated in intracellular bacteria as efficiently as Bodipy-palmitate, while  Bodipy  558/568  C12  was  poorly  assimilated  by  Mtb.  We  chose  to  use Bodipy-palmitate as fatty acids of the length (16 carbons) are more commonly found in the membranes of macrophages infected with Mtb.2.  For labeling one T75 flask add 1.6~ml of 100~uM Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA (from Step 1 of Labeling) to 18.4~ml of pre-warmed cuvette buffer (see Recipes) such that the final concentration of the labeled lipid is 8uM , mix well. Use 15~ml for labeling one T75 flask, and 30~ml for labeling one T50 flask. Increase volumes in Steps 1 and 2 (Labeling) accordingly for larger infections.3.  Remove media from infected macrophages and replace with cuvette buffer containing Bodipy-palmitate (volumes are described in Step 2 of Labeling). Incubate the infected macrophages with label at 37~^°C and 6.0% C O_2 for 1h .4.  After the 1 h labeling period, remove the cuvette buffer containing the Bodipy-palmitate and add fresh pre-warmed cuvette buffer without label for 1 h. Use 15ml for one T75 flask, and 30 ml for one T150 flask. Proceed to the next step right after 1h incubation without label. Note: Alternatively, Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA can be added directly to infected macrophages cultured in BMDM media. Label chase can be performed in fresh pre-warmed BMDM medium as well. No cuvette buffer is needed in this case. From our experience, either way of labeling gives comparable results.# Isolation of intracellular bacteriaNote: This portion of the protocol is based on phagosome isolation described in (Pethe et al., 2004).1.  Remove  cuvette  buffer  from  labeled  infected  cells,  and  quickly  rinse  with 10 m of Homogenization buffer (see Recipes).2.  Add 15ml of ice-cold Homogenization buffer, incubate at 4~^°C for 10-15 min , and harvest macrophages by scraping off from each flask with cell scrapers. Transfer the cells to a 50~ml conical tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 r p m(514xg) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. This and all the following centrifugations are done at 4^°C to block any further uptake of lipids by bacteria.3.  Remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 1.5ml of Homogenization buffer by pipetting and transfer the cells to a 15~ml conical tube. Lyse the cells by 25-70 passages through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle. Monitor cell lysis under a microscope using glasstic slides with 100 grids. Continue until >95% of the cells are lysed, when intact cells are replaced by cell debris. Note: For safety purposes place glass slide with infected material in 150×15 mm Petri dish.4.  Increase the volume to 5ml by adding Homogenization buffer, resuspend well. Centrifuge cell lysate at 800 rpm (146xg) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, G H-3.8 rotor.5.  Transfer the supernatant (suspension of phagosomes) into a new 15ml conical tube. The pellet mainly consists of nuclei and unlysed cells and is discarded.6.  To the suspension add 20% Tween 80 (see Recipes) to a final concentration of 0.1% , mix well and leave at 4^°C for 15 min to lyse Mtb containing vacuoles.7.  Quickly agitate by shaking and isolate the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,430~x~g) for 15m i n in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.8.  Remove supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of 0.05% tyloxapol in PBS (see Recipes). Centrifuge bacteria down at 3,300 rpm (2,500x g) for 15 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.9.  Optional: repeat the previous step to further remove labeled fatty acids adhered to bacterial cell surface. Note:  Non-specific  binding  of  bodipy-palmitate  to  the  bacterial  cell  surface  produces background signal. However, if tested strains/conditions produce a significant difference in specific uptake of label, this background noise wouldn’t impact results greatly.10. Remove supernatant and fix bacteria in 4% PFA (see Recipes) for ^24~h~ in ^2ml screw-cap tube. Note: If you have flow cytometer in BSL3 facility, bacteria can be analyzed live immediately after isolation and without fixation.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Bacterial Culture\nGrow Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains at 37°C in 7H9 OADC media in standing culture in T25 flasks until mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6).\nStart bacterial cultures from frozen stocks and maintain for no more than 5 passages.\nEnsure constitutive expression of fluorescent protein by Mtb for further detection.\n## Special Considerations\nDo not grow more than 10 ml of bacterial culture in a T25 flask to ensure sufficient oxygen availability to Mtb.\nEstimate timing for bacterial culture growth, considering that Mtb divides approximately once in two days when grown in standing culture.\n## Strain Selection and Validation\nUse Mtb Erdman strains with an integrated pMV306 plasmid expressing mCherry from smyc promoter (smyc'::mCherry).\nTest the wild-type strain constitutively expressing fluorescent protein for the ability to efficiently intake Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection by microscopy.\n## Macrophage Isolation and Culturing\nDifferentiate macrophages from bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice.\nMaintain macrophages in BMDM media with antibiotics at 37°C and 6.0% CO2 for 10 days before infection.\n## Infection\nSeed macrophages in antibiotic-free BMDM media into T150 tissue culture flasks (3 × 10^7 cells and 40-50 ml of BMDM media per flask) to obtain confluent monolayers.\n## Bacterial Preparation\nMeasure the optical density of mid-log Mtb culture.\nCentrifuge the required amount of culture at 3,300 rpm (2,500 × g) for 12 min.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 1.5 ml of BUB.\n## Infection Procedure\nAdd 2.4 ml of bacterial suspension to each T150 flask containing 3 × 10^7 cells.\nMix well and incubate at 37°C and 6% CO2 for 4 hours.\nRemove extracellular bacteria by replacing with fresh pre-warmed antibiotic-free BMDM media.\nMaintain infected macrophages in BMDM medium at 37°C and 6% CO2 for 3 days.\n## Labeling\n## Labeling Solution Preparation\nPre-warm sterile 1% fatty acid-free BSA in PBS at 37°C for 30-60 min.\nAdd 4 mM stock of Bodipy-palmitate to obtain 100 μM concentration.\n## Labeling Procedure\nAdd 1.6 ml of 100 μM Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA to 18.4 ml of pre-warmed cuvette buffer.\nReplace media from infected macrophages with cuvette buffer containing Bodipy-palmitate and incubate at 37°C and 6.0% CO2 for 1 hour.\nRemove the cuvette buffer containing the Bodipy-palmitate and add fresh pre-warmed cuvette buffer without label for 1 hour.\n## Isolation of Intracellular Bacteria\nRemove cuvette buffer from labeled infected cells and quickly rinse with 10 ml of Homogenization buffer.\n## Cell Lysis\nAdd 15 ml of ice-cold Homogenization buffer and incubate at 4°C for 10-15 min.\nHarvest macrophages by scraping off from each flask with cell scrapers and transfer to a 50 ml conical tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm (514 × g) for 10 min.\n## Phagosome Isolation\nResuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of Homogenization buffer and lyse the cells by 25-70 passages through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle.\nIncrease the volume to 5 ml by adding Homogenization buffer and centrifuge the cell lysate at 800 rpm (146 × g) for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant (suspension of phagosomes) into a new 15 ml conical tube.\n## Bacterial Isolation\nAdd 20% Tween 80 to a final concentration of 0.1% and mix well, leaving at 4°C for 15 min to lyse Mtb-containing vacuoles.\nIsolate the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,430 × g) for 15 min.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of 0.05% tyloxapol in PBS and centrifuge bacteria down at 3,300 rpm (2,500 × g) for 15 min.\nFix bacteria in 4% PFA for 24 hours in a 2 ml screw-cap tube.","keywords":" Fatty acid, Uptake, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Macrophage, Intracellular, Mycobacteria, Bodipy","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2734"}}

PNatB (pACYCduet-naa20-naa25) was a gift from Dan Mulvihill (Addgene plasmid no. 53613). Y-to-A mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. Expression was conducted in phosphate-buffered (50 mM, pH 7.2) 2YT-medium with 0.4% glycerol and 2 mM MgCl2; protein production was induced at ~ OD 1.2 with 1 mM IPTG and run for 4 h at 37 °C. Purification of α-syn was performed as previously described [65] with modifications to the original protocol: Cell lysis and release of thermostable α-syn was carried out by boiling the frozen cell pellet in a fourfold volume of dH2O at 95 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000g and 4 °C for 30 min, the protein in the supernatant was precipitated by gradually adding saturated ammonium sulfate solution until 50% saturation was reached. Protein was pelleted at 15,000g and 4 °C for 30 min and resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8, sterile-filtered, and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q FF anion exchange chromatography column (GE Healthcare). Acetyl-α-syn eluted at ~ 300 mM NaCl in a 0- to 500-mM NaCl gradient. The elution fractions were precipitated by adding saturated ammonium sulfate solution to 50% saturation, the protein pelleted as before, resuspended in dH2O and finally purified by SEC on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 and 100 mM KCl. Final yields were ~ 40–60 mg/L culture for acetyl-α-syn WT and Y-to-A mutants, and around 20 mg/L for acetyl-α-syn A140C. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 275 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5600 M− 1 cm− 1 if not stated otherwise.DiY formation by UV irradiationFor DiY formation, 100 μM solutions of α-syn WT and α-syn Y-to-A mutants as well as tauK18Δ280AA, tyrosine, and ribonuclease A in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 and 100 mM KCl were loaded into a fluorescence cuvette with a magnetic stir bar. All spectra and DiY formation kinetics were recorded on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer at 20 °C. Before and after DiY formation, tyrosine spectra (λEx = 274 nm, bandwidth 5 nm; λEm = 290–350 nm) and DiY spectra (λEx = 320 nm, bandwidth 5 nm; λEm = 350–480 nm) were recorded. DiY formation was induced at λEx = 280 nm (bandwidth 20 nm) and monitored every second at λEm = 410 nm (bandwidth 20 nm). UV irradiation and fluorescence readings were stopped when a fluorescence intensity plateau was reached to prevent excessive photobleaching. For evaluation, buffer fluorescence was subtracted and the mean of triplicate measurements was normalized by setting the highest fluorescence of WT DiY-α-syn to unity. The kinetics of DiY formation were fit to a consecutive two-step reaction or a one-step first-order reaction, using Abscissa 2D plot and fit tool by Rüdiger Brühl†.Separation of DiY-α-syn dimers and DiY-α-syn monomersTo compare the inhibitory potential of DiY-α-syn dimers and monomers, the dimeric and monomeric fractions of WT DiY-α-syn, the single Y-to-A mutant Y39A DiY-α-syn (C-term DiY-α-syn), and the triple Y-to-A mutant Y125A–Y133A–Y136A (N-term DiY-α-syn) were separated by SEC. DiY formation was carried out in solutions of 200 μM WT α-syn, 267 μM Y39A α-syn, and 800 μM Y125A–Y133A–Y136A α-syn, that is, at equivalent tyrosine concentration. After DiY formation by UV irradiation, 500 μl of each sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) and separated by SEC in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 and 100 mM KCl. For analytical SEC, 200-μl samples with half the protein concentration were loaded. As DiY formation significantly changed the absorption of α-syn at 275 nm and to ensure comparability of the different Y-to-A mutants, protein concentrations were measured at 220 nm using extinction coefficients of 105,344 M− 1 cm− 1 for monomers and 210,688 M− 1 cm− 1 for dimers. These extinction coefficients were determined by measuring the absorbance at 220 nm of a WT α-syn sample of known concentration (determined by absorbance at 275 nm). For determination of the dimer and monomer yields, SEC peaks were integrated by the UNICORN evaluation software (GE Healthcare). For the measurement of DiY fluorescence in the dimer and monomer peaks, three ~ 400-μl samples of 100 μM WT DiY-α-syn were separated by SEC, the protein concentrations of dimer and monomer peaks were measured as before, and the fluorescence was measured at 410 nm with λEx = 320 nm. The mean DiY fluorescence of triplicate samples was calculated.Aggregation assaysThT aggregation assays were conducted in Corning half area 96-well plates with non-binding surface (Corning No. 3881). For the assays starting from monomeric α-syn, 25 μM of non-irradiated WT α-syn was mixed with either 25 μM DiY-α-syn, 25 μM of UV-irradiated tyrosine, or 25 μM of UV-irradiated tauK18Δ280AA. Aggregation assays were run for 5 days with measurement of ThT fluorescence every 20 min (λEx = 450 nm, bandwidth 5 nm; λEm = 482 nm, bandwidth 10 nm) with 15 s of orbital shaking before the measurement in Tecan Infinite 200PRO and Tecan Infinite M1000PRO plate readers. The assays were conducted at 37 °C in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ThT, and 0.05% NaN3, reflecting intracellular potassium and magnesium concentration as well as intracellular pH and ionic strength. A glass ball was added per well to improve mixing. Per well, 125-μl sample was used. To evaluate the effect of DiY-α-syn dimers and A140C dimers on α-syn aggregation, 1.25 μM dimers (WT DiY-α-syn dimer, C-terminal DiY-α-syn dimer, N-terminal DiY-α-syn dimer, A140C dimer) were added to 25 μM of WT monomers (1:20 stoichiometry). DiY-α-syn monomer fractions were used at a total α-syn concentration of 10 μM in order to achieve the same DiY concentration as in the dimer experiments, considering the eight-times lower DiY fluorescence compared to DiY-α-syn dimers. For seeded aggregation assays, 10% (in monomer units, 2.5 μM) of WT α-syn fibril seeds were added to 25 μM WT α-syn aggregation reactions. The seed solution was prepared as follows: 300 μl of 100 μM α-syn was fibrillated at 37 °C and 800 rpm for 3 days in a 2-ml tube containing a glass balls in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). The fibril solution was diluted to 50 μM and sonicated with a tip sonicator (Bandelin Sonopuls HD3200, BANDELIN electronic) at 10% power (20 W) for 60 s, with 1-s pulses separated by 4-s pause. In seeded aggregation experiments, samples were not shaken prior to measurement to disfavor formation of new nuclei or fibril fragmentation. For evaluation, the mean of triplicate measurements was referenced to the highest fluorescence of 25 μM WT α-syn.NMR spectroscopyNMR spectra were acquired at 10 °C using a 750-MHz Avance III spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a cryogenically cooled Z-axis pulse-field-gradient triple-resonance probe. The NMR samples contained [U–15N]-α-syn at a concentration of 100 μM in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 8% D2O, with or without the addition of 400 μM [NA]-DiY-α-syn.AFMFor AFM imaging, 20 μl of the indicated samples shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 was incubated for 30 min on a gold-coated mica surface; the solution was taken off, shortly washed with dH2O, and dried under a nitrogen stream. The samples were imaged by tapping mode on a JPK Instruments Nanowizard 3.Denaturation and seeding capacity of DiY-crosslinked α-syn fibrilsFor the fibril denaturation experiments, 3 ml of 150 μM α-syn WT in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% NaN3 was fibrillated at 37 °C in a 15-ml tube under stirring with a magnetic stir bar for 3 days. Four aliquots of 700 μl were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. One-half of each aliquot was subjected to DiY crosslinking by UV irradiation as described before. Subsequently, 300 μl of the fibril solutions (with and without DiY crosslinks) was mixed with 20 μM ThT and 4 M guanidinium chloride at pH 8 in a glass cuvette with a stir bar (total volume: 600 μl) and incubated for 90 min at 20 °C inside the fluorometer. ThT fluorescence was measured every min at 485 nm (λEx = 445 nm). Buffer fluorescence was subtracted. After 90 min of denaturation, 500 μl of the solutions was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) and separated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 25 mM K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 and 100 mM KCl.

Preparation of the pre-culture (to be used for all subsequent culture conditions)1.  Streak Xoo strain ΔrpfB from -80~^°C glycerol stock on NA plate supplemented with cephalexin at a final concentration of 20u/m l .2.  Incubate the plate at 28~^°C for 4 days to obtain single colonies.3.  With a pipette tip, isolate one ΔrpfB colony and inoculate in 10 ml of NB supplemented with cephalexin with a final concentration of 20 u/m l in a 50ml Erlenmeyer flask.4.  Incubate the ΔrpfB culture in the M a×Q^T M6000 Incubated/Refrigerated shaker at 28~^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36h .B.  Preparation of Xoo culture1.  Measure the optical density at 600 n m (O D_600) of the 1:4 diluted ΔrpfB pre-culture in a spectrophotometer and calculate the optical density of the pre-culture by multiplying the measured reading by 4 (the dilution ratio).2.  Adjust the O D_600 of the pre-culture to approximately 1.0 using NB.3.  Add 1ml of adjusted ΔrpfB pre-culture to 50~ml nutrient broth (1: 50 dilution) in a 250~m~l~ Erlenmeyer flask with vent cap.4.  Incubate the culture at 28^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36-48 h until it reaches early stationary phase (O D_600approx2.8–3.0) for DSF/BDSF extraction. Note: If other bacterial strains are assayed, other specific growth conditions should be optimized.C.  Extracellular DSF/BDSF extraction1.  Dispense 4ml of the ΔrpfB culture in two 2 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 8,000 xg for 15 min to obtain the culture supernatant for extracellular DSF/BDSF extraction.2.  Transfer the supernatant to two new ^2ml microtubes and adjust its pH to 3.0-3.5 by adding adequate volume (usually 15 to 20ul ) of 6N hydrochloric acid and monitoring pH changes with test strips.3.  Dispense the supernatant in eight 2 ml microtubes ( :0.5ml per tube), and then, add 1 ml of ethyl acetate into each tube.4.  Vortex the microtubes at the highest speed for 5 min to extract DSF and BDSF molecules and centrifuge at 8,000xg for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.5.  Carefully collect the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) into four 1.5~ml microtubes by pipetting and evaporate the solvent in a CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40^°C to complete dryness (approximately 20m i n ).6.  Dispense 0.15ml of methanol in the four 1.5ml microtubes and vortex the microtubes vigorously for 30 sec, which ensures that all residues are re-dissolved.7.  Centrifuge the microtubes at 2,000× g for 1 min, and then transfer the extraction solution from each microtube into a new 1.5~ml microtube using a pipette.8.  Evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40~^°C to complete dryness (approximately 40m i n ). Notes: a.  At this point, the samples may be frozen at -20~^°C for later steps or analyzed immediately as described in the following steps. b.  For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps C3 to C8 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.D.  Intracellular DSF/BDSF extraction1.  Decant 40ml ΔrpfB culture in a 50ml centrifuge tubes and harvest bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000× g for 15min at 4^°C .2.  Discard the supernatant and add 40 mI of 1x PBS buffer in the tube to wash the cell pellets by pipetting gently.3.  Discard the supernatant and harvest the washed bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000xg for 15 min at 4^°C .4.  Re-suspend the cell pellets in 10ml of ice-cold sodium acetate buffer (p H3.8) .5.  Freeze the re-suspension solution in a -20~^°C freezer for 1 h and then incubate the bacterial suspension at room temperature for 30 to 60 min to thaw the suspension completely.6.  Homogenize the cells by pipetting the thawed bacterial suspension gently.7.  Repeat steps D5 and D6 once more.8.  Sonicate the cell homogenate for a total of 6 min by sonicating for 3 sec, pausing for 4 sec, and repeating this sonication/pause cycle120 times (amplitude set at 20% ) on ice using the Vibra cellTMHigh Intensity Ultrasonic Liquid Processors connected with a Tapered Microtip probe (3 mm diameter).9.  Transfer the centrifuge tube containing the processed cell lysate into a water bath for 5 min at 95^°C to denature the total protein.10. Separate the soluble lysis solution with bacterial cell debris by centrifuging at 8,000 x g for 15 min at 4^°C .11. After centrifugation, immediately transfer the soluble lysis solution (the transparent part) to a 250~ml Erlenmeyer glass flask using a pipette. This should be performed carefully to avoid disturbing the precipitate at the bottom of the tube.12. Add _20 ml of ethyl acetate in the flask and close the flask with the cap immediately to avoid evaporation and spillage of the volatile solvent. Incubate the capped flask in the MaxQTM 6000 shaker at 28~^°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 10 min to extract DSF and BDSF.13. Transfer the extraction mixture to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 6,000xg for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.14. Transfer the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) to a 100ml pear shaped glass flask by pipetting carefully.15. Remove the solvent by rotary evaporation at 40^°C to complete dryness (approximately 5 min).16. Dispense 1 ml of methanol into the pear shaped glass flask to re-dissolve the residue by pipetting several times.17. Transfer the solution to a 1.5~ml microtube and evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40^°C to complete dryness. Notes: a.  At this point, the samples may be frozen at - -20~^°C for later steps or be analyzed immediately as described in the following steps. b.  For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps D12 to D17 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.# E.  LC/MS sample preparation1.  Crude extraction samples can be obtained by adding 200~ul of methanol into the 1.5~ml microtube and vortex at the highest speed.2.  To remove any insoluble particles in the sample, filter the crude sample through an MS syringe filter (0.2 um) connected with  a  1 ml disposable syringe. Collect the filtered sample (approximately 100ul_,^ ) in a new 1.5ml microtube.3.  Transfer 60ul of filtered sample into a chromatography vial fitted with a flat bottom insert using a pipette. Cap the vials. Samples are now ready for LC/MS analysis.# F.  LC/MS procedure1.  Use HPLC grade methanol (eluent B)-water (eluent A) (80:20, v/v) as mobile phase.2.  Maintain the column temperature at 30~^°C and flow rate at 0.4m l/m i n .3.  Equilibrate the column for 15 min or longer until the baseline is stable.4.  Inject 5~ul aliquots of prepared samples onto an Agilent 1290 Infinity UPLC with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column.5.  Detect DSF and BDSF molecules using a diode array detector (Agilent G4212A) set to a detection wavelength of 220 n m with a band width of 4n m .6.

Transduction of CRE recombinase was performed with the adenovirus CMV-CRE (Vector Biolabs, 1045 N) at a MOI of 100. Empty adenovirus (CMV-null) was used as control at the same MOI.P19 cells were maintained in MEM-α (Gibco, 41061-029) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For differentiation, cells were transferred into Neurobasal medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 1% B-27 without vitamin A, 1 × GlutaMAX (Thermo, 35050061) and 1μg/ml Laminin. Differentiation medium was changed every 24 hours if required. P19 cells were transfected at 80% confluence with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-027) in proliferation medium following the manufacturer’s instructions with a 1:2 ratio (DNA:Lipofectamine). A list of plasmids is provided in Table S2 in supplementary information.Quantitative Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Template cDNAs were synthesised using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen), and qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiFast SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) in a Lightcycler 480 PCR system (Roche). EiF1α was used as housekeeping gene to normalise each qPCR target and the values were calculated as fold increase to proliferation samples. Thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 mins, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds.

Proteins concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was carried out in 10% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (Novex) in MOPS buffer. After transfer onto nitrocellulose, membranes were blocked for 1hr with 10% non-fat milk in TBS-0.1% Tween solution and probed overnight with primary antibody: Ascl1 (1:300, hybridoma supernatant, gift from David Anderson and François Guillemot), Histone H3 (1:10,000, Abcam, ab1791) and α-Tubulin (1:10,000, Abcam, ab7291), LaminB (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-6216) and Huwe1 (1:1,000, Bethyl Laboratories, A300-486A). Mouse secondary (goat anti-mouse HRP 1:10,000, Millipore, 71045-3) or rabbit secondary (1:5,000, Rabbit IgG HRP linked, GE Healthcare, NA934V) antibodies were used for detection in 5% milk in TBS-0.1% Tween solution for 1 hour. Membranes were developed using ECL Prime (GE Healthcare, RPN2232) for Ascl1 or ECL detection reagents (GE Healthcare, RPN2106) for the other antibodies. All western blots were performed at least in triplicate.Cellular FractionationCor3–1 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 in 10 cm dishes and P19 were seeded at 1.0 × 106 in 10 cm dishes. P19 were transfected with 3 μg of Ascl1 plasmid constructs (Supplementary Table S2). Cells were washed once with room temperature PBS and scraped into 1 ml PBS. Cells were pelleted at 1,200 rpm in an eppendorf tube at 4 °C for 3 min. Pellets were covered with 5 volumes of ice-cold E1 buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) complemented with 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail and were gently pipetted up and down (5 times) before centrifugation at 3,400 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube (cytoplasm fraction) and the pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting in the same volume of E1 buffer and centrifuged as before. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting in the same volume of E1 and left for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 3,400 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting in 2 volumes of ice-cold E2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH8.0) complemented with 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail and centrifuged at 3,400 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube (nucleus fraction) and the pellet was resupsended in the same volume of E2 and centrifuged as before. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of E2 and left for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 3,400 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold E3 buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl) complemented with 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail by gentle pipetting in the same volume used for E1. The solution (chromatin fraction) was sonicated in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 5 min on setting H, 30 sec ON/30 sec OFF for western blot analysis or was digested with Benzonase (1:1,000, Novagen, 70664-3) for TUBEs pull down. All fractions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min and protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit.Agarose-TUBEs pull down15 μl of 50% Agarose-TUBEs (LifeSensors, UM401) were used to pull down between 350 μg and 450 μg of ubiquitylated proteins from the cytoplasm and chromatin fractions in 500 μl final volume of respective buffers. Incubation was performed for 1 hour at 4 °C on a rocker platform. Agarose-TUBEs were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube (unbound fraction). Agarose-TUBEs were washed 3 times following the manufacturer’s instructions and were boiled in reducing sample buffer (25 μl) for 5 min, centrifuged at maximum speed in a top bench centrifuge for 1 min and eluted samples were loaded onto gels (Bound fraction: 15 μl for Ascl1 and 5 μl for loading controls) alongside 5 μg of proteins from the unbound fraction and 5 μg from fractionated lysates (Input).Protein Stability AssayCor3-1 cells or transfected P19 cells (2 μg Ascl1 plasmid DNA in 6 cm dishes) were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, C4859). At define time points, cells were harvested with RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, R0278) or fractioned. Equal amount of each whole cell lysate or fractionated lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE and immmunoblotted with mouse anti-Ascl1 and mouse anti-α-Tubulin (1:10,000, Abcam). Protein levels were quantified with FiJi software. Half-lives were calculated using a nonlinear regression analysis (One phase decay, Prism).ImmunocytochemistryCor3-1 or P19 cells were plated onto ECM-coated (Sigma, E1270) 24-well plate (25,000 cells per well). At indicated time, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and permeabilised in 0.2% Triton X-100 PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed in PBS with 3% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. Anti-Ascl1 primary antibody (Abcam, ab74065) was used at 5 μg/ml final concentration in PBS with 2% FBS and 0.02% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C without rocking. The next day, cells were washed 3 times in 0.02% Triton X-100 PBS for 5 mins and incubate with secondary antibody (Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Life Technologies) diluted 1:500 in PBS with 2% FBS and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Cells were next washed 3 times in 0.02% Triton X-100 PBS for 5 mins and incubated in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:10,000) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After 2 washes in PBS, fluorescence labelling was visualised with Axio Scan (Zeiss).Gene Reporter AssayP19 cells were plated into 48-well plates (75,000 cells per well) and transfected the day after with 100 ng ΔM short-Luciferase (Supplementary Table S2), 50 ng pRL-TK (Renilla, Promega) and 100 ng Ascl1 using Lipofectamine 2000 in proliferation media. One set of cells was harvested the day after (proliferation samples) with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1910) while the other set of cells was transferred into differentiation media and harvested 24 hours later. Luciferase assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) using a Tecan Infinite 200Pro microplate reader. Values for Luciferase were normalised to Renilla-Luciferase values and data are presented as means ± SEM of duplicate and experiments were repeated three times.Data availabilityAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplementary Information files).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5854709.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"FICZ Exposure and Viral Infection in Mice","text":"FICZ Exposure and Viral Infection in Mice\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  0.1-10 μl pipet tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thermo ScientificTM, catalog number: QSP#TF104)\n2. 1-200~ul pipet tips (Corning, catalog number: 4845)\n3.  100-1,000 μl pipet tips (Corning, catalog number: 4846)\n4. 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes (Corning, Axygen®, catalog number: MCT-150-A)\n5.  1 ml syringe (NIPRO, catalog number: 4987458080104)\n6.  27 G hypodermic needle (TERUMO, catalog number: NN-2719S)\n7.

The amount of linear PAA incorporated into the network determines its viscous properties. We formulate different recipes for elastic and viscoelastic gels with storage moduli of 1 and 5 kPa and loss moduli up to 10% of the storage moduli (Table I). Our method also allows selective covalent coupling of adhesion proteins to either the networked or the linear PAA. The rheological characterization of polyacrylamide with and without linear PAA has previously been described in other works,16,19 and therefore, Table I presents averaged values of the G′ (elastic) and G″ (viscous) moduli measured at a constant frequency of 1 rad/s. Since the gels are linearly elastic, a wide range of strains can be used to measure G′ and G″. Depending on the sensitivity of the instrument used and the magnitude of G′, a shear strain of 1% to 5% is generally recommended.TABLE I.Averaged values of the elastic and viscous moduli measured at 1 rad/s as a function of the content of acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, and linear PAA in the initial gel mix. n = 5 gels.G′ (Pa)G″ (Pa)% acrylamide% bis-acrylamide% of linear acrylamide163614.50.1015902065.50.12.7555801080.10628049080.152.751-Prepare coverslipsThe gel will be cast between two glass coverslips in order to be flat. Glass coverslips need to be functionalized in order for the gel to stick to the bottom coverslip and to be non-adherent to the top coverslip.Glutaraldehyde treatment for the adhesive coverslip •Immerse coverslips in 0.1 M NaOH for 1 min.•Remove NaOH and air-dry coverslips.•Under a chemical hood, immerse coverslips in 3-APTMS for 3 min.•Wash several times with H20 until no foaming is observed. If 3-APTMS is not removed, it will react with glutaraldehyde in the next step and form an orange precipitate. If an orange precipitate is observed, discard coverslips and restart at step 1.•Cover each glass with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and let sit 1 h.•Aspirate off glutaraldehyde and air-dry coverslips (do not rinse).•Store coverslips in a vacuum container.SurfaSil treatment for non-adhesive coverslips •Dilute SurfaSil Siliconized Fluid (Interchem) in acetone to make a 5% working solution.•Immerse glass coverslips in SurfaSil solution for 10 s.•Rinse coverslips with acetone.•Rinse coverslip with methanol two times. This rinse prevents interaction of the SurfaSil coating with water, thus reversing the siliconization.•Air-dry coverslips.2-Polymerize the linear PAA •Make a 5% acrylamide solution in H2O according to the recipe in Table II.•Add TEMED 0.05% and ammonium persulfate (APS) 0.025%. The amount of APS is very low in order to ensure the formation of long linear PAA chains, and so their radii of gyration are much larger than the mesh size of the crosslinked network and the linear chains will not be able to quickly diffuse out of the free surface gel.•Polymerize for 1h at 37 °C.•Store at 4 °C in the dark; this solution can be stored for months.•Linear polyacrylamide solution when properly polymerized is highly viscous, therefore cutting the pipette tip before solution transferring might be needed.TABLE II.Recipes for 10 ml of inert or activated linear PAA solution.Type of linear PAAAcrylamide 40%H2OTEMEDAPSNHS 4% in DMSOinert1.25 ml8.72 ml5 μl24 μl…activated1.25 ml7.72 ml5 μl24 μl1 ml3- Covalent attachment of adhesion proteins or other ligands to the viscoelastic substrateThe adhesive ligand to which the cell attaches can be linked to the dissipative linear chains alone, to the elastic crosslinked network alone, or both linear and crosslinked PAA of the viscoelastic gel. Separate methods are needed for each of these three ways to attach adhesive ligands.Attach proteins to the linear PAA: NHS in the DMSO methodIn order to activate the linear PAA and cross-link proteins to the dissipative part of the gel, which proceeds as described above, add 1 ml of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) 4% in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the 5% acrylamide solution and then add TEMED and APS to initiate the polymerization (Fig. 3, left panel). The resulting linear PAA solution will covalently bind proteins upon incubation within a protein solution in HEPES (50 mM at pH = 8.2).FIG. 3.Illustration of the three methods to make viscoelastic gels presenting adhesion proteins on the linear PAA, the network of PAA or both types of PAA.3-Polymerize the PAA networkThe next step in the method is to polymerize the network to effectively form a hydrogel. The recipes presented in Table I can be modified in order to change the properties of the network; however, when trying a new recipe, make sure that gels do not swell after incubation in cell media. Changes in the gel volume upon immersion can induce changes in their mechanical properties too.Make the hydrogel•Mix acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, linear acrylamide, TEMED, and H2O according to the recipe presented in Table III.•Add APS 10%, mix and pipet 35 μl of gel mix, deposit it on a glutaraldehyde-treated coverslip, and then add a siliconized coverslip on top of the droplet.•After 15 min, add milliQ H2O on the side of the gel to avoid drying.•After 15 additional minutes, remove the top coverslip and immerse the gel in H2O. If there is access to a shear rheometer, the viscoelastic properties of the gel can be directly measured from an analogous sample polymerized between the plates of the rheometer.TABLE III.Gel recipes in μl for the total of 500 μl gel mix.

In our experience, mixing of linear chains into the polymerizing crosslinked acrylamide is not always identical, and G′ tends to decrease as reagents get old, presumably due to oxidation. The changes can be as large as a factor of 50%.The main limitation of this viscoelastic gel formulation is the possibility that the linear PAA chains will escape the gel surface, which can occur on long time scales. Therefore, we suggest that the gels are freshly used for cell culture and not stored for weeks prior to experiments. Moreover, our viscoelastic systems can potentially exhibit microphase separation, and the linear chains are free to diffuse out of the free surface of the gel, but at the level of light microscopy using 100× objectives, we see no evidence for significant surface differences, except that macroscopically viscoelastic gels can look slightly cloudy.Attach protein to both the linear (1) and the network PAA (2): Sulfo-SANPAH method [Fig. 3 right panel (3)] •Rinse the gel with 50 mM HEPES, pH = 8.2.•Prepare a 5 mM sulfosuccinimidyl 6–(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (sulfo-SANPAH) solution in 75% H2O and 25% DMSO.•Cover the surface of the gel with the sulfo-SANPAH solution and illuminate with a 320–365 nm UV light source for 15 min. Properly activated sulfo-SANPAH should change color from bright orange into darker, burnt orange. Rinse 3 times with HEPES: 50 mM pH = 8.2.•Immerse the gels in the protein solution in HEPES: 50 mM pH = 8.2. Incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C (both incubations result in uniform surface coating). UV-irradiated sulfo-SANPAH-coated gels should be immersed in the protein solution not later than 30 min postactivation to ensure optimal reactivity.•Rinse 3 times with PBS and store at 4 °C for up to 2 days before seeding cells.Attach proteins to the network: NHS in the DMSO method [Fig. 3 middle panel (2)] •Prepare NHS solution: 4% in DMSO.•Add 100 μl of NHS 4% in DMSO for 1 ml of gel mix. Adjust the amount of H2O to compensate for the NHS in DMSO solution added to the gel mix.•Add APS and TEMED to initiate the polymerization and cast the gel as previously described.•Once the gel is rinsed and immersed in HEPES 50 mM pH = 8.2, illuminate it for 15 min with a deep UV light to sterilize it.•Immerse the gels in the protein solution in HEPES 50 mM pH = 8.2. Incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.•Rinse 3 times with PBS and store at 4 °C for up to 2 days before seeding cells.Attach proteins to the network: NHS in the toluene methodIt is possible to use a solution of 2% NHS in toluene instead of 4% NHS in DMSO. However, this method is less effective for our gels, notably because the viscosity of the gel mix makes it harder to remove the toluene. Small droplets of toluene often remain in the gel mix and interfere with the polymerization of the network. In this case, follow these steps: •Add 200 μl of NHS 2% in toluene to 1 ml of gel mix and thoroughly agitate until the solution becomes uniformly turbid. This indicates that there are small droplets of toluene formed within the gel mix solution.•Incubate for 5 min on the bench and centrifuge at 10 000 × g for 5 min to separate the toluene from the aqueous gel mix.•Remove the toluene by pipetting the gel mix in the lower layer in the tube and transfer it to a new tube.•Initiate the network polymerization and follow the same procedure as described in the NHS in the DMSO section.Potential problems and solutionsThe crucial element in making viscoelastic substrates is the solution of long unbranched polyacrylamide chains needed to add dissipation to the elastic crosslinked PAA network. The chains should be as long as possible and at least several times larger in radius of gyration than the mesh size of the network. For a 5% crosslinked polyacrylamide gel, the mesh size is on the order of 10 nm, and therefore, the radius of gyration of the linear PAA needs to be >40 nm, which requires a very high molecular weight and, therefore, a minimal amount of polymer initiator in order to prevent the rapid formation of numerous short chains. If the chains are too short, they can diffuse out of the network, disturbing the substrate surface and altering the viscoelasticity. At the same time, growing free radical chains need to be protected from quenching by oxygen or other electron-rich molecules in the solution. Care must be taken to carefully de-oxygenate all solutions to prevent termination of the polymerization reaction before the reaction is complete. A third issue is related to the high viscosity of the linear PAA stock solution. Mixing the acrylamide and bis-acrylamide monomer solutions as well as the APS and TEMED needed to initiate network polymerization into the linear PAA must be done not only slowly to prevent air bubbles from forming but also rapidly enough so that the gel point of the network is not reached before mixing is complete. The small volumes (<1 ml) to make substrates suitable for microscopy can be done conveniently using the protocols listed here. Larger volumes might need adjustment to the mixing method or substitution of UV-activated or thermally activated initiators.4- Cell seeding •30 min before plating cells, immerse the gel in cell media and incubate at 37 °C. This step ensures that gels are at 37 °C and soaked in media when cells are plated.•Remove enough media so that gels will be hydrated but not immersed.•Plate the cells on the gel in a small volume to maximize cellular adhesion.•After 2 h or once cells start to spread, add media on the plate to immerse the gels and the cells.5- Cell culture3T3 mouse fibroblasts from ATCC were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and 1% streptomycin and penicillin (Gibco). 22Rv1 cells from ATCC were cultivated in RPMI (ATCC) with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and 1% streptomycin and penicillin (Gibco). Human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells from ATCC were maintained in F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and 1% streptomycin and penicillin (Gibco). Cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere. Cells were passaged with trypsin (Gibco) once they reached confluence. No animal or human studies were performed, and therefore, ethics approval is not required.6- Traction force microscopyTraction force microscopy can be performed with these gels. In order to monitor the gel deformation, 0.2 μm fluorescent beads are included inside the gel. The gel mix containing beads needs to be thoroughly vortexed to ensure a good dispersion of the beads inside the gels. The gels are then made as described above. To quantify the deformation made by cells, we took one phase image of a cell and two images of fluorescent beads before and after removing the cell from the gel. To ensure an accurate estimation of the gel deformation, we waited for at least 200 s before taking the bead image after removing cells so that the gel underwent a complete relaxation. We first quantified gel deformation using particle image velocimetry20,21 and calculated traction using Fourier Transform Traction Microscopy.21,22 Cellular contraction was quantified using net contractile moment, which is a scalar measure of cell's contractile strength.22 Because the relaxation time of the viscoelastic gel is much shorter than the time for cells to spread and build contractile force,23 we used the same home-made codes for both elastic and viscoelastic gels.7- StatisticsThe distribution of the projected cell area, spreading velocity, net contractile moment, and motility speed values was tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The distribution of our datasets did not follow a Gaussian law, and so we used non-parametric statistics tests to compare cells on elastic and viscoelastic substrates. Kruskal–Wallis and ANOVA with the Tukey post-tests were applied to compare datasets. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p-values <0.01. The * symbol indicated p-values < 0.01, ** was for p-values < 0.001, and *** for p-values < 0001.

{"protocol_id":"Bio-protocol-3937","domain":"Immunological Techniques","article":{"id":"PMC6918740","pmid":"","pmcid":"PMC6918740","methods_text":"MATERIALS AND METHODSMiceThis study was approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) at the Hospital for Sick Children (N32238). All experiments were performed following standard operating procedures established by The Centre for Phenogenomics and approved by the institutional ACC. NEC was induced in C57BL/6 mice between P5 and P9 by hyperosmolar formula gavage feeding, oral LPS and exposure to systemic hypoxia, according to an established protocol (Zani et al., 2016). To minimize potential effects of undernutrition in our analysis, pups were fed 50 µl/g three times a day, at 07:00, 14:00 and 22:00. This volume is equivalent to that fed to human premature infants (150 ml/kg/day). The formula used was Esbilac Puppy Milk Replacer Powder (PetAg). To investigate the function of formula feeding on intestinal mucosal damage, we randomly assigned P5 mouse pups to four groups: DF: control pups fed by the dam's breast milk.DF+LPS: pups fed by the dam's breast milk and gavage fed with LPS. Pups were only transiently separated from the mother for sham gavage feeding three times a day without infusion of formula to minimize potential stress of maternal separation and gavage feeding on the intestine (Li et al., 2017).Formula+LPS: pups separated from the mother and gavage fed with formula and LPS. The formula provides 187 kcal/kg/day.Formula+LPS+hypoxia: pups separated from the mother and gavage fed with formula and LPS. Pups were exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) before each feeding.To minimize potential confounding effects of maternal separation in our analysis, we focused on ileal tissue, which is not affected by maternal separation (Zani et al., 2016).To test the role of arginine and L-NAME in experimental NEC, arginine (240 mg/kg/day, Sigma-Aldrich) or L-NAME (60 mg/kg/day, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the formula prior to gavage feeding. At P9, 60 mg/kg pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe, MA, USA) was injected intraperitoneally before the last feeding. Mice were euthanized 90 min after feeding.For single gavage feeding, pups at P1, P5 and P9 were fasted for 8 h and then injected with pimonidazole and fed with PBS or hyperosmolar formula. RosamT/mG/+;Tie2-Cre mice, which express GFP in endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells and derivatives, were generated by crossing Tie2-Cre (Proctor et al., 2005) with RosamT/mG/+ (Muzumdar et al., 2007) mice.Haematoxylin and Eosin staining and immunohistochemistryIleal tissues were harvested, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin or subjected to immunohistochemistry for pimonidazole (anti-pimonidazole antibody HP1-100; Hypoxyprobe; 1:100) and CPS-1 (anti-CPS-1 antibody; Abcam, Cambridge, USA; 1:250). Histologic sections were blindly assessed by two independent investigators (Y.K. and H.M.) following a published scoring system for NEC severity and pimonidazole levels (Chen et al., 2016c).qRT-PCRTotal RNA was purified using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA synthesis kit (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed using a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). All samples were run in triplicate and gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping genes RPLO, Pgk-1 and TBP (also known as Ppbp), according to previous publications (Egan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2010). Primer sequences are listed in Table S1.Isolation of intestinal epithelial cells and western blottingIntestinal epithelial cells were isolated as previously described (Zeineldin and Neufeld, 2012). Briefly, ileum samples were dissected from the mesentery and rinsed in cold PBS. The lumen was flushed with cold PBS and cut open longitudinally. Intestinal segments were incubated in 0.04% sodium hypochlorite on ice for 15 min, transferred to cold solution B (2.7 mM KCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 680 mM Na2HPO4, 0.5 m MDTT and 2.5 mM EDTA) and incubated for 30 min with gentle agitation. Tissue was disaggregated gently by pipetting a few times, and the supernatant containing epithelial cells was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. Pellets were then lysed in tissue extraction buffer. Western blotting was conducted with 20 µg epithelial lysate. Blots were probed with anti-HIF-1α (SC53546, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:50) and β-actin (4967, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500) antibodies at 4°C for 72 h and 24 h, respectively (Fig. S2). Quantitative measurement of protein expression was performed using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR Biosciences).In vivo two-photon microscopy of intestinal microcirculationA 1.9F feeding catheter was inserted into RosamT/mG/+;Tie2-Cre pups anesthetized with isoflurane (Fig. 3A). Pups were secured on a warm plate under a two-photon microscope. The terminal ileum (3-4 cm proximal to the cecum) was externalized by laparotomy and fixed loosely between a holder loop and a coverslip placed slightly above the abdominal wall. Submucosal haemodynamic was recorded every 10 min from 0 to 50 min after feeding. Vessel diameter was measured on at least six points, usually just above the bifurcation on arterioles, before and after feeding. Arterial blood flow velocity was measured using flow image correlation spectroscopy, as previously described (Sironi et al., 2014). Arterial blood flow was calculated using the following formula: π(diameter/2)2 × velocity. White blood cells are larger and move more slowly than the smaller platelets. These properties allowed identification and analysis of their movement in live microcirculation videos (Koike et al., 2018). After recording the time course of the haemodynamic response to feeding, small pieces of jejunum and ileum were resected and cut open for observation of the villus microvasculature under a two-photon microscope.Endothelial cell sorting and RNA-seqP1 and P9 RosamT/mG/+;Tie2-Cre pups were fasted for 8 h and fed with PBS or hyperosmolar formula. The small intestine was harvested 90 min after feeding. After rinsing and flushing with cold PBS three times to remove blood, the lumen was opened longitudinally and cut into small segments. Intestinal cells were dissociated from tissue by incubating in TrypLE™ Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed and sorted for GFP-positive and -negative cells in a flow cytometer (MoFlo XDP cell sorter). RNA was isolated using a TRIzol® Plus RNA Purification Kit (Zymo Research), and RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cDNA synthesis was performed with a SMART-Seq Ultra low-input RNA kit (Clontech Laboratories). A cDNA library was then prepared used a Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Sequencing reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic then mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Mapped read counts were obtained using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Clustering of genes involved in arginine synthesis and the endothelin pathway was performed using Cluster 3.0 and visualized with Java Treeview. Enrichment of pathways in differentially expressed genes was determined using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2017).Breast milkSurplus human breast milk from four healthy donors was collected at the Hospital for Sick Children's nutritional services (Toronto, ON, Canada) and stored and processed as described previously (Wu et al., 2019).Statistical analysisData were tested for normality of distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and compared using parametric or nonparametric tests as appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Data are presented as mean±s.d. P<0.05 was considered significant.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6918740.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Generation and Maturation of Human Monocyte-derived DCs","text":"Generation and Maturation of Human Monocyte-derived DCs\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Two hundred μl of loading dye was added to cells and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 45 min. After resting in room temperature for 20 min, cells were placed in a 5 ml FACS tube and analyzed by flow cytometry to set the basal level of intracellular Ca2+ intensity (30 sec). Unopsonized pre-germinated C. albicans prepared in 10 μl of HBSS was then added to the tube for continuous flow cytometric analysis for additional 300–420 sec. Data were analyzed by the kinetic mode of FlowJo software. All procedures including sample acquisition and data analysis followed that of modified Bio-protocol published by S. Lee [36]. Original FACS contour plot for measurement of Ca2+ intensity is shown in S1 Fig.Immunofluorescence stainingFive hundred thousand neutrophils mixed with C. albicans at a ratio of 1:2 were plated on coverslips and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Coverslips were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After thorough wash, coverslips were blocked (10% FBS in PBS) and stained with anti-neutrophil elastase (abcam, 1:50) or anti-histone H3 antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:100) at 4°C overnight. Coverslips were stained with cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) or cell-impermeable DNA dye SYTOX Orange (1 μM, Life technology) diluted in blocking buffer and left on ice for 15 min. Coverslips were then mounted by mounting gel and subject to fluorescence microscopic or confocal microscopic analysis.Live cell imagingFive hundred thousand neutrophils suspended in HBSS containing SYTOX Orange (0.5 μM) and cell-permeable DNA dye Draq5 (2 μM) were seeded in a chamber (1 μ-Slide 8 well ibiTreat plates, ibidi). After spun down, 2 × 106 of pre-germinated C. albicans OG1 were added. NET release was monitored by inverted confocal microscope LSM 780 AxioObserver Z1 for three-color.NET fungicidal activity assayTwenty thousand neutrophils suspended in HBSS were seeded in 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 30 min before addition of 4 x 105 unopsonized C. albicans yeasts. Wells containing C. albicans yeasts without neutrophils were used as control. Plate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min to spin down yeasts. HBSS containing micrococcal nuclease or heat-inactivated MNase (h.i. MNase) was added to the final concentration of 10 U/ml. Buffer was collected and cold H2O (pH = 11) was added 3 h later to lyse cells. C. albicans was detached by mini cell scraper and vigorously pipetting. The number of viable fungi was determined by plating the supernatant on yeast-peptone-dextrose agar plate. Colony counts (CFU) were enumerated 2 days later. The ability of neutrophils to kill C. albicans is presented as % killing of C. albicans which was calculated by dividing the difference of CFU counts between the control group (without neutrophils) and neutrophil-added groups by the counts of the control.Western blot analysisNeutrophils stimulated with or without C. albicans hyphae (MOI = 2) were lysed in PhosphoSafe Extraction Reagent (EMD Millipore). Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis at 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Fluka) for 1 h and incubated in buffer containing rabbit anti-pSyk (Tyr575), -citrullinated histone H3 (R2 + R8 + R17) (Abcam), -pPKCδ (Ser645) (Cell Signaling), and -β-actin, -GAPDH (GeneTex) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Membrane was then incubated with buffer containing goat anti-rabbit/rat IgG-HRP antibody (GeneTex) for 1 h. Western Chemiluminescent HRP (Millipore) was used as substrate.Peritoneal C. albicans infection in casein-peritonitis miceMice were injected with 1 ml of 9% casein (9 g of casein sodium salt dissolved in 100 ml of hot PBS) intraperitoneally twice with an interval of 18 h. Four hours after the second casein injection, mice were given 1×108 of C. albicans intraperitoneally. For some experiments, HBSS containing 100 U of micrococcal nuclease or heat-inactivated MNase (h.i. MNase) was administered intraperitoneally at the time of infection. At indicated time after infection, peritoneal exudates, mesentery tissues and kidneys were collected and subject to following experiments.In vivo imaging and quantification of fluorescenceBefore imaging, mice were injected with 1 ml of 9% casein intraperitoneally twice with an interval of 18 h. Four hours later, mice were infected by 5 × 108 of C. albicans (SC 5314 or CAF2-dTomato) in 200 μl HBSS intraperitoneally. To monitor NET release, mice were given an additional intraperitoneal injection of 100 μl SYTOX Orange (5 μM) at the time of infection. A Xenogen IVIS Imaging System 200 series (PerkinElemer Inc.) was used to quantify fluorescent C. albicans (CAF2-dTomato) or the release of extracellular DNA over time. Photons in user-specified region of interest (ROI, gated area) during 10 sec exposure were measured by Living Image 3.2 software. Relative intensity of total photons in ROI was calculated based on the intensity at 1 h after infection.Tissue and peritoneal exudate cell immunofluorescence stainingMesentery were embedded in O.C.T. and allowed to freeze at -80°C overnight. Five μm thick tissue sections were cut and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Peritoneal exudates were diluted 1:5 and seeded on coverslips for 1 h. Slides and coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, left on ice for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and let sit at room temperature for 5 min. After wash, samples were blocked (PBS containing 5% FBS) and stained with anti-histone H3 (Cell Signaling), -Ki67 and -Ly6G (Biolegend) antibodies at 4°C overnight. Nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 15 min. Samples were then mounted by mounting gel and subject to confocal microscopic analysis.Quantification of fungal loadKidneys were collected and homogenized in a tissue grinder with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. Peritoneal exudate was collected from mice after intraperitoneal injection of 5 ml of HBSS. Homogenates and peritoneal fluids were treated with 0.5 U of micrococcal nuclease and incubated at 37°C for 10 min to digest DNA entangled with fungus. One hundred microliter of kidney homogenates and peritoneal exudates were plated on YPD agar. Colonies were counted after incubation at 30°C for 2–3 days.Ki67 stainingPeritoneal exudates from naïve and infected mice were collected, treated with 0.5 U/ml MNase and subject to surface staining for neutrophil marker CD11b and Ly6G. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 1% saponin, cells were stained with anti-Ki67 antibody prepared in staining buffer (0.5% saponin) overnight. Cells were fixed in 1% PFA and subject to flow cytometric analysis.StatisticsStudent t test was used to compare the difference between two groups. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.Ethics statementMouse study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guidebook for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, The Third Edition, 2007, published by The Chinese-Taipei Society of Laboratory Animal Sciences.

Euthanize the mice by injecting 0.5ml of avertin intraperitoneally with a 25 Gauge needle. The mice become unresponsive after 1-2 min. Note:  Verify  the  institution  approved  ethical  regulations  on  animal  welfare  if  other euthanization methods are in place.2.  Check the absence of cerebrospinal reflexes by pinching the paw of the posterior limbs with a forceps.3.  After spraying the animal with 70% ethanol, open the right flank and remove the spleen. Remove any fatty tissue that is connected with the spleen and place the organ in 15~ml tube with 5ml of ice-cold HBSS.4.  Bring the spleen to a 35~m m Petri dish and mince the organ into pieces by using the scissors. To obtain a good dissociation of the tissue, proceed until no pieces are visible with the bare eyes.5.  Add 1 ml of ice-cold RPMI, bring the cell suspension to a 15~ml Falcon tube and put on ice. Complete all other organs before adding the digestion medium.6.  Add 1 ml of 37~^°C preheated 2x digestion medium to the cell suspension and bring all organs to the 37^°C warm water bath. Make sure the shaker is put to its maximum setting. Note: Shaking the sample will allow more efficient digestion of the tissue by decreasing its precipitation.7.  Incubate the cell suspension for 15 min and dissociate the cell suspension by pipetting the solution up and down through a Pasteur pipette.8.  Repeat step 7 once more.9.  Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down cell suspension at 400× g7 min 4^°C .10. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in _2m l of ice-cold osmotic lysis buffer. Incubate for acute4 at room temperature and subsequently add 10 m of ice-cold MACS buffer. Spin down cell suspension at 400× g7m i n4^°C .11. Resuspend cells in 10 m of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100~um cell strainer. One can reuse the 15~ml tube to collect the filtered cells. Take a 20~ul counting sample and spin down rest of cell suspension at 400× g7 min 4^°C .12. Add 180~ul of trypan blue to the 20~ul of counting sample and mix well. Count cells. After digestion, 1 spleen will normally contain up to 60-100×10^6 cells.13. Remove supernatant from cell pellet and resuspend in antibody mix I at a concentration of 50 x 10^6 cells per 1~ml of mix (see table 1). Stain 20 m i n on ice in the dark. Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C .Table 1. Antibody mix I in MACS buffer()14. Remove supernatant from cell pellet and add 90ul of ice-cold MACS buffer per 10×10^6 cells.15. Add 5-10~ul/10×10^6 cells of anti-FITC microbeads. Resuspend and incubate 15 min on ice. Add 10ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Discard supernatant.16. Prepare LD columns according to manufacturer’s protocol.17. After preparation, place a 15ml tube on ice under the LD column.18. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100um cell strainer on the LD column. Note: This minimizes the probability of cell clots obstructing the LD column. After the 1 ml of cell suspension has run through, wash 2 times with _2m l of ice-cold MACS buffer. Make sure that cell suspension runs through each time. Discard the column and spin down the effluent (7 min 400× g4^°C) . Aspirate the supernatant.19. Stain cell pellet in 500~ul of antibody mix II. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Add 10 ml of icecold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer. Bring the cell suspension to a 5~ml polystyrene tube with a cell strainer cap to remove possible clots.Table 2. Antibody mix II in PBS()Note: Use of PBS is necessary for optimal staining of dead cells with the Fixable viability dye eFluor 506.20. Single stains are prepared by diluting 1 drop of Ultra comp eBeads in _2m l of PBS. Make sure to shake the beads thoroughly before use as precipitation occurs. Bring 200~ul of this bead suspension to seven 5~ml reaction tubes (6 fluorochromes +1 unstained sample). Antibodies conjugated to bright fluorochomes (PE-eFluor610, Pe-Cy5, AF-647) are diluted 1/2small,000 , other antibodies are diluted 1/400. Stain 15 min on ice in the dark. Add 1~ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400× g4^°C . Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in 200ul of PBS. Proceed to the cell sorter.Note: Viability dyes do not bind to the Ultra comp eBeads. Since we exclude dead cells (defined by a positive staining for eFluor 506) there is no need to compensate this fluorochrome. If compensation is preferred, cells can be stained with a 1 in 200 dilution of the eFluor 506 viability dye in PBS. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Wash cells with 1ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400xg4^°C. Resuspend the cells in 200 μl of PBS.21. An example of a gating setup is shown below.()Figure 1.  Gating strategy of splenic DCs. A strict gating strategy in the FSC-H/FSC-A plot allows the exclusion of doublets. The CD1 1b^+ DCs (LinCD11c MHCII CD1 1b^+ cells) contain a fraction of monocyte derived cells (specific infections with pathogens or inflammation can drastically increase this cell population, contaminating the CD1 1b^+ DC gate). The conventional CD1 1b^+ DCs can be identified by exclusion of the D64^+ cells.# Notes1.  One should take in mind to work as fast as possible. Once removed from the live animal splenic DC subsets viability is quickly compromised. Furthermore, working with cold reagents improves overall survival.2.  A good dissociation of the tissue by use of scissor and Pasteur pipettes and adequate incubation of the splenocytes in the digestion medium is crucial for optimal cell retrieval. Whenadjusting the antibody mix, keep in mind that the enzymatic digestion can potentially cleave off surface proteins expressed on the cell types of interest.3.  In optimal conditions, negative selection with the use of MACS beads removes 90-95% of C D3e^+ and C D19^+ cells. This reduces the number of cells to approximate 5-10×10^6 cells and a total sorting time to approximate _20m i n .4.  One can sort 80,000-120,000 CD8a+ DCs and 400,000-600,000 CD11b+ DCs from 1 spleen (in homeostatic conditions). The CD1 1b^+ DCs can be further subdivided by the use of surface markers ESAM or CD4.5.  In the case that the cells are to be cultured, the scientist should keep in mind to work sterile from the moment the spleen is obtained (step 4). Prior to use, the buffers can be filtered to remove potential pathogens using a 0.2um filter.6.  Cells can be brought into culture in R10 medium with the addition of 250n g/m l of recombinant murine Flt3L. Without any further stimulation; survival of these dendritic cell subsets is less than 60% after ^24h of culture.# Recipes1.

The initial structures for the triple helices were constructed de novo using single strands with three repeats (nine nucleotides) each; the process involves both the careful determination of the relevant hydrogen bonds between the third strand and the canonical duplex, and the assembly of the three strands. The modeling process and the resulting initial structures are described in the next section.The MD simulations were carried out with the Amber18 package (58) with force field BSC1 (59) (DNA part) and BSC0 (60) + OL3 (61) (RNA part) for different atypical structures combined with the protonated AMBER force field (62). The protonation was completed with tleap (58). The simulations for the pyrimidine third strand were carried both with and without protonation for the cytosine. The TIP3P water model (63) was used for the explicit solvent simulations under periodic boundary conditions in truncated octahedron water boxes. The appropriate number of Na+ ions (parameters in (64)) was used for neutralization of the nucleic acid charges. Additional simulations were run with Mg2 + ions (parameters in (65)) in a 0.20M concentration, with Cl− ions added for neutralization. One run, apR was additionally run with 40 and 80 mM concentrations.Electrostatics were handled by the Particle Mesh Ewald method (66), with a direct space cutoff of 9 Å. The cutoff for van der Waals interactions was set as 9 Å. We used Langevin dynamics with a coupling parameter 1.0 ps−1. The SHAKE algorithm (67) was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen bonds were identified by cpptraj as supplied by ambertools18 (58) with a distance cutoff of 3.5 Å and an angle cutoff of 140°.Starting conformations for MD calculations were obtained as follows. We first minimized the energy for the initial conformations obtained by modeling: first, by keeping the nucleic acid and ions fixed; then, by allowing them to move. Subsequently, the temperature was gradually raised using constant volume simulations from 0 to 300 K over 50 ps runs with a 1 fs time step. Then a 100 ps run at constant volume was used to gradually reduce the restraining harmonic constants for nucleic acids and ions. After we obtained the starting conformations, we performed MD runs for 1 μs with a 2 fs time step under a constant pressure of 1 atm. Conformations were saved every 20 ps. In the MD runs, weak constraints of 1kcal/mol on hydrogen bonds for the ending bases were added to the system in order to reduce artificial fraying at the ends.We also performed a test run with the same method and procedure as mentioned above for an experimentally obtained structure of DNA triple helix with protonated cytosine whose PDB ID is 1BWG (68). After a 1 μs MD simulation, we found that the triplex was stable and very close to the experimental conformation. To further investigate the stability of selected structures, we also performed MD runs under higher temperatures with all other computational settings being the same as above.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7515735.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Harvest and Culture of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages","text":"Harvest and Culture of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Place mouse with abdomen up on paper towel in hood.4.  Swab abdomen with 70% alcohol or isopropanol.5.  Make a small incision in the center of the skin overlying the peritoneal wall. Note: Small incision is made on the skin to peel the skin off. Injection and extraction can be at different sites on peritoneal membrane.6.  Firmly pull skin to expose the peritoneal wall.7.  Insert the needle to peritoneal membrane; avoid inserting needle into guts or bladder. Inject 5ml of PBS EDTA into peritoneal cavity.8.  Massage abdomen for approximately 10-15 seconds.9.  Withdraw the needle slowly. Change the _25 needle on the syringe to a _20 needle.10. Use one hand to push the fluid to one side of the peritoneum. Using the other hand, insert needle to the side of cavity with plenty of fluid and withdraw the fluid from peritoneum. Avoid fat, gut or mesentery, which may clog the needle. Try to draw as much fluid as possible. Usually, approximately 4-4.5~ml fluid can be recovered from one mouse.11. Remove needle from syringe and dispense contents into a centrifuge tube on ice.12. Centrifuge peritoneal cells (300xg;3m i n) and collect cell pellet. Usually about 2-4 million resident peritoneal cells can be recovered from one C57BL/6 mouse using this method and about 50% are peritoneal macrophages.13. Resuspend cell pellet from one mouse in 1~ml of cRPMI medium, count cells.14. Culture peritoneal cells in a 12-well plate, 2 million/well in 1 ml cRPMI at 37~^°C with 5% C O_2 for 6-18 h . During this time, peritoneal macrophages adhere to the plastic surface. The floating non-macrophages can then be washed away by adding and aspirating 0.5ml cRPMI medium twice.15. The adherent macrophages are ready to use.B.  Harvest  and culture thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages can be harvested and cultured in the same way as described in steps 1-15 with additional steps as shown below.16. Preparation of 3% thioglycollate medium.a.  Heat a 300~ml flask with an aluminum foil lid angle180-200 ^°C in a laboratory oven for at least 18h to get rid of endotoxin. b.  Suspend 6 grams of thioglycollate medium in _200ml of pyrogen-free water. c.  Autoclave (15~psi/121~^°C/15~min) . d.  After cooling, aliquot to 15ml sterile Falcon tubes. Store in a dark place at room temperature for 2 months before using. We have found that thioglycollate medium stored at room temperature for up to 2 years can still be used. 17. Inject 1 ml of aged thioglycollate i.p. per mouse. Wait for 4-5 days, harvest peritoneal cells. About 10 million macrophages can be recovered from one mouse.

However, the same protocol can be applied to other brain regions or after the performance of behavioral paradigms.1.  Kill the mouse by cervical dislocation or decapitation and rapidly immerse the head in liquid nitrogen for 4 sec to rapidly cool down the brain without allowing it to freeze (this step helps for the brain dissection and to better preserve protein phosphorylation). We recommend to euthanize the mouse with physical methods such as cervical dislocation rather than using anesthetics or carbon dioxide, but this step should be adapted to local ethical committee guidelines.2.  Remove the brain, remove the meninges, and dissect the striatum of the 2 hemispheres (approx15-20mg) ) on an ice-cooled glass dish as it is shown in Video 1.# Video 1. Striatum extraction()3.  Homogenize the striata in a glass dounce homogenizer (10 strokes of the loose pestle followed by 10 strokes of the tight pestle) with 1 ml of synaptoneurosome buffer kept on  ice.  The  number  of  strokes  might  vary  depending  on  the  individual homogenizer/pestles and the size of the brain area. All the steps are performed at 4^°C (either on ice or in a 4^°C room). Representative pictures of the homogenates at each step are shown in Figure 1.4.  Transfer the homogenate into an Eppendorf tube and aliquot 100ul as an input.5.  Prepare all the material required for the synaptoneurosome preparation procedure as indicated in Figure 2.6.  Pre-wet 3 Nylon net filters ( 100um pore) in synaptoneurosome buffer on ice.7.  Attach a 5~ml syringe without the plunger (syringe #1) to a swinnex filter holder (#1) containing the 3 pre-wetted Nylon net filters 100um) , as illustrated in Figure 3. Then, attach this swinnex to another 5ml syringe (syringe #2) without the plunger, which has been attached at the dispensing tip end to a swinnex filter holder containing 1 Mitex membrane filter ( 10um pore) (swinnex filter holder #2). Place on the other side of the swinnex #2 a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube on ice to collect the sample.8.  With a 1-ml pipette, load the sample into the end of the barrel of the syringe #1 attached to a swinnex filter holder #1, insert the plunger and push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe.9.  Remove the 5~ml syringe #1 and replace it by a 60 ml syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters angle100 um , push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. This step helps to push down the sample to the barrel of syringe #2.10. Remove the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters ( angle100 um , place the plunger of the 5~ml syringe #2, which is connected to the swinnex filter holder #2 containing 1 Mitex membrane filter (10 um) , and push down until all the air is gone from the syringe.11. Remove the syringe #2 and replace it with a 60~mI syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #2 , push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. At this step, the homogenate should be in the 1.5ml Eppendorf tube placed on ice.12. Centrifuge 1 min at 4,000 x g at 4^°C . Pipette the supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube and discard the pellet. A representative image of how the pellet looks is shown in Figure 1b.13. Centrifuge the supernatant for 4 min at 14,000xg at 4~^°C . Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100~ul synaptoneurosome buffer. A representative image of how the pellet looks is shown in Figure 1c. (The volume to re-suspend the pellet might change depending on the protein concentration desired. From the striata of one mouse the synaptoneurosome preparation obtained has a protein concentration around 1-2ug/ul . The pellet can be stored at -80~^°C until used.# bio-protocolNote: In this type of synaptoneurosome preparation we obtained samples containing enrichment of both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, a substantial reduction of glial markers and absence of nuclear markers (Biever et al., 2015).

Animals were housed in groups of four per cage and maintained under controlled temperature (23 ± 2°C), light/dark period of 12/12 h and with free access to food and water. All procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation (COBEA) and were approved by the Committee on Ethics in Animal Use of Federal University of ABC (CEUA–UFABC), protocol 008/13.In our STZ-induced AD-like sporadic dementia model, rats were first anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. After an incision in the skin, the skull was exposed and two holes were made bilaterally, following coordinates measured from bregma (–0.8 mm on the anteroposterior, ±1.4 mm on the medial-lateral and –3.6 mm on the dorso-ventral axis, in accordance with a rat brain atlas; Paxinos and Watson, 2005).Both STZ (Sigma) and AEA (Sigma) were diluted in citrate buffer and injected by an automated microinjection system, consisting of a microtube of polyethylene (PE-10) attached to an injection needle and to a microsyringe (Hamilton) coupled to an infusion pump (Model Bi2000 – Insight Equipment LTDA).Each animal received two icv bilateral injections of 2 μL (1 μL/min): the first one was citrate (vehicle) or AEA (100 ng) (Fraga et al., 2009), followed by another injection of vehicle or STZ (2 mg/kg) (Motzko-Soares et al., 2018) 5 min later. After each infusion, the injection needle remained for at least 2 min in place, in order to prevent reflux of the administered solution. After surgery, animals received intramuscular injections of an antibiotic (pentabiotic, 24,000 UI/kg) and an anti-inflammatory and analgesic (meloxicam, 1 mg/kg). Also, 2 mL of saline solution were administered subcutaneously for rehydration and the animals were maintained in thermal blankets with controlled temperature until the recovery. Animals were kept in individual home cages for 5 days after surgery and body weight, food, water intake and animals well-being were accompanied daily.Before and after surgery, animals were weighted and their blood glucose was measured. Thirty days after surgery, one set of animals (n = 12–16 per group) was submitted to the NOR task (days 30–31), followed by contextual and tone fear conditioning (CFC and TFC, respectively) (days 34–36) and another set (n = 10–11 per group) was submitted to escape latency in the EPM (days 30-31), followed by pre-pulse inhibition (days 34–35). Cages and objects were always cleaned with 15% ethanol in between testing. After all behavioral tests, animals were euthanized and their brains were removed for histological or Western blotting analysis (Figure 1).FIGURE 1Timeline of the experimental design. Thirty days after receiving AEA (100 ng) and/or STZ (2 mg/kg), rats were submitted to behavioral tasks to detect early deficits of emotional and non-emotional memories and sensorimotor gating. One week after the end of behavioral tasks, the animals were sacrificed for either neurochemical analysis of their hippocampi by Western Blotting (WB) or histological analyses of their brains.New Object Recognition (NOR)Hippocampus-dependent non-emotional memory was examined using the NOR task, using an adapted protocol after standardization tests for short-term memory evaluation (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988; Carey et al., 2009; Botton et al., 2010; Espinosa et al., 2013). In the first phase (habituation; day 30), animals were allowed to freely explore a circular arena (60 cm in diameter) for 10 min; during training phase II (day 31), objects A and B (a pair of identical LEGO® towers) were placed on opposite sides of the arena 1 cm from the walls and finally in phase III, performed 10 min later, animals returned from their home cage to the arena, where object B was replaced by a new object C (a plastic bottle) placed at the same position.Experiments were recorded by a camera positioned on the ceiling for latter analysis of the videos. Animal’s movement throughout the arena was analyzed by Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA, United States) and in the training and test sessions, the time that animals spent exploring each object was manually recorded. The exploration of each object was defined as the period in which the animal remained in physical and visual contact with the object (or no more than 0.5 cm far from the object), with frontal and active exploration (sniffing or manipulation, for example). The recognition index was calculated by the formula: [Time exploring object C or B/ (Time exploring object A + Time exploring object C or B)] in the training and the test sessions to evaluate the short-term recognition memory performance. In healthy animals, a higher recognition index is expected in the test compared to the training session, indicating that the animals learned the task.Contextual and Tone Fear Conditioning (CFC and TFC)To evaluate associative emotional memory, animals were submitted to CFC and TFC training in conditioning box (Med-Associates, Inc., St. Albans, VT, United States), following a protocol adapted from previous studies (Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969; LeDoux, 1993; Wood and Anagnostaras, 2011; Bueno et al., 2017). The training of CFC and TFC and also the CFC test (days 34 and 35, respectively) were carried out in the context A, consisting of a conditioning box with striped walls, grid floor and bright light. TFC test (day 36) was performed in context B, a box with semicircular white walls, flat floor, light off and cleaned with acetic acid 30%. During training, after 120 s of habituation, a tone (2 kHz, 90 dB) was emitted for 30 s and in the last second, a foot-shock (1 s, 1 mA) was delivered (unconditioned stimulus-US). One minute later, the animal was placed back in its home cage.For CFC test, animals were re-exposed 24 h after training to the context A for 240 s, without any other stimulus. During TFC test animals were placed 24 h after CFC test the context B and 2 min after habituation, the conditioned stimulus (tone) was presented twice, for 30 s after 120 s and for 30 s after 180 s (adapted from Simões et al., 2016). During all sessions, the animals’ behavior was video-taped for latter analysis using the Video Freeze software (Version 1.12.0.0, Med-Associates). The freezing time in test sessions was measured as a parameter of fear memory retention.Escape Latency in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)The EPM used in the present study was made of white wood and consisted of a central square (10 × 10 cm) from which four arms (10 × 50 cm each) radiated outward, two of them with walls around the edge 40 cm high (closed arms), and two of them without walls (open arms). The arms were arranged so that the two open arms were opposite to each other. Arms were elevated to a height of 55 cm off the floor. The EPM is classically used for evaluation of locomotion and anxiety, but a modified version of the EPM have been also used for testing memory (Sachdeva et al., 2014; Hill et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015). The experimental procedure was carried out as described by Sachdeva et al. (2014), allowing also the study of a memory parameter, measuring the retention of latency to escape to a closed arm in the test, compared to the training session.In the training session (day 30), each animal was placed in an open arm, facing outwards and was allowed to explore the EPM for 90 s. The time taken by the rat to enter in a closed arm for the first time was measured (initial escape latency – L1) and movement parameters were recorded by a camera and analyzed by Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA, United States). During test (day 31), animals were allowed to explore the EPM, identically as in the training session and the final escape latency was recorded (L2). The retention of escape latency [(L2/L1) × 100] represents the learning of non-associative emotional memory, related to the natural tendency of rodents to prefer dark and closed places.Prepulse Inhibition (PPI)Two startle chambers were used to perform the PPI test (SR-LAB, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, United States). Each box contained a loudspeaker located 24 cm above a Plexiglas cylinder fixed on a platform. The startle responses were detected within the cylinder and digitized by a piezoelectric accelerometer positioned below this platform. The startle amplitude was calculated by the mean of 100 samples during the first 100 ms after the onset of the stimulus (1/ms) and presented in arbitrary units (AU). Five days before to surgery, the animals were submitted to a PPI matching session and homogeneously distributed among the groups based on their natural percentage of PPI.After surgery (day 34 or 35), animals were submitted to a new PPI session identical to the matching procedure (adapted from Rodrigues et al., 2017). The test session started with an acclimatization period of 5 min with a constant background white noise (60 dB). Then, the animals were exposed to various combinations of white noise pulses with random intertrial intervals of 10–20 s for 20 min. The stimuli could be one of four types: pulse alone (40 ms, 120 dB), prepulse alone (20 ms, 70, 75, or 80 dB), pulse preceded by prepulse (100 ms interval) or no stimulus, except the background noise. The different types of stimuli were presented pseudorandomly so that no combination was presented twice consecutively. The PPI percentages were calculated by the relation between the means of acoustic startle response (ASR) amplitudes to prepulse-pulse trials to the pulse alone ones. According to the formula: 100 × (ASR to pulse - ASR to prepulse-pulse)/ASR to pulse.Protein Extraction and Western BlottingOne week after all behavioral tests, animals randomly assigned for Western Blotting analysis were euthanized by decapitation. Their brains were quickly dissected to isolate the hippocampus, which was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. For protein extraction, hippocampal tissue was homogenized, and proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 10% SDS, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States).The preparation of synaptosomes was carried out as previously described (Canas et al., 2009). Briefly, hippocampi were homogenized with ice-cold buffered sucrose solution (pH 7.4, 0.32 M) and then the homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 12 min at 4°C. Next, the supernatants were discarded and the pellets resuspended in 45% Percoll, before being centrifuged (16,000 ×g, 2 min at 4°C). The top layer was collected and resuspended in Krebs-HEPES-Ringer solution and centrifuged again (16,000 ×g, 2 min at 4°C). The pellet was finally resuspended in lysis buffer for subsequent analysis of synaptophysin, syntaxin-I, SNAP-25 and CB1R. The quantification of protein levels was performed using BCA colorimetric assay, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard, to allow equalizing the protein concentration of all samples by adding sample buffer. Samples were then denatured for 20 min at 70°C and stored at –20°C for further use.Total cell lysates or synaptosomes (10 or 20 μg, depending on the protein) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 5% non-fat milk) for 1 h at 20°C, followed by incubation for 24 h at 4°C with the primary antibodies: mouse anti-total tau (1:1,000, Genway), rabbit anti-p-tau Ser199/202 (1:1,000, Sigma), rabbit anti-p-tau Ser396 (1:1,000, Abcam), rabbit anti-BAG2 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals), rabbit anti-Hsp70 (1:1,000, Sigma), goat anti-CB1R (generously supplied by Ken Mackie, Indiana University), mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:20,000, Sigma), mouse anti-syntaxin-I (1:20,000, Sigma), mouse anti-SNAP-25 (1:20,000, Sigma), mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:10,000, Sigma) and mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:2,000, Novus Biologicals). After washing with TBS with Tween 20 (TBS-T), membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), conjugated to peroxidase, for 2 h at 20°C. Membranes were then washed in TBS-T for 20 min and incubated with chemiluminescent reagent. Quantification of the optical density of the bands was performed using Image Lab 6.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. United States) and values were normalized by β-actin or α-tubulin density and expressed as percentage related to control samples (Veh/Veh).Perfusion and Histological ProcedureAnimals randomly assigned for histological analysis were overdosed with urethane and transcardially perfused initially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 0.01 M, pH 7.4) and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, for fixation. After perfusion, brains were removed and stored in the same fixative solution for 24 h. Brains were then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution in 0.01 M PBS, frozen in dry ice and stored at -80°C until being sliced in a cryostat (–20°C) into 40 μm coronal sections, which were mounted on gelatinized blades and stained with cresyl violet. Slices were photographed using a light microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY, United States) for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the cross-sectional area of the lateral ventricles (LV), which was used as a general index of alteration of brain morphology, often associated with neuronal damage.Statistical AnalysisTreatment was considered the categorical factor and one-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis of movement, anxiety and memory parameters in EPM and fear conditioning training as well as for the measurements of ventricle area and the densities in the Western blotting. Body weight, blood glucose levels, memory parameters in the NOR, CFC, TFC, %PPI, and ASR were analyzed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Data were expressed as means ± SEM and Duncan’s test was used as post hoc in all experiments. Differences were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05 and all analysis were performed using Statistica 7.0 Stat Soft, Inc. 2004.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6176656.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Repeated Cross-fostering Protocol as a Mouse Model of Early Environmental Instability","text":"Repeated Cross-fostering Protocol as a Mouse Model of Early Environmental Instability\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n()\nNote: See Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.

Clean cages to isolate pregnant females and to temporarily maintain pups on the hot plate during the manipulation, as described at point 2 of \"procedure step by step\" (washed transparent high temperature polysufone cages 26.7×20.7×14.0cm , with clean bedding)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n1.  Mating procedure consists of housing 2 females with one male for 15 d. The experimental procedure requires that, at least 5 females give birth simultaneously, within 24 h. To reach this goal and synchronize females’ estrous cycles, females can be exposed to male odor a few days before mating. Check female weight at mating.2.  On the 15th day, males are removed and females are weighed to assess pregnant status. The weight gained, suggesting pregnancy, depends on the strain of mice used, but generally is between 10 and 15 grams in 15 days (a 50% increase of weight from mating day); in addition visible lateral \"bulges\" are visible in pregnant females.3.  Each pregnant female is isolated in a clean cage with bedding material (paper) and daily checked for pups’ birth (PND0: postnatal day 0).4.  At least 5 females should give birth within ^24~h~ to permit the execution of RCF manipulation.# Rcf manipulationPups spend the first postnatal day (PND0) with the biological mother. Differently from the ‘‘classical’’ cross-fostering procedures (Bartolomucci et al., 2004), RCF pups change caregiver every ^24~h~ for 4 times during the PND1-PND4 time interval, by following a rotation scheme: Each dam receives 4 different litters during this manipulation and each litter changes 4 different adoptive dams (the adoptive dam is the mum who receive pups from another mum) (also see Figure 2 and the Table 1). The daily procedure consists of first removing the mother from the cage, then removing its entire litter, and immediately introducing this litter into the home-cage of a different dam whose pups had just been removed. The RCF pups were then semi-covered with the home-cage bedding of the adoptive mother, which is then reintroduced in the cage and left with this litter for the next24 h. The entire procedure lasted about 30 sec and took place every day at same time during the light cycle of a standard light/dark cycle (usually between 10.30 and 11.00 a.m.). This was repeated daily, four times until reaching the fourth adoptive mother, with which pups were left until weaning (PND 28).Adoptive dams should be lactating females with pups of the same age as fostered litters and litters should have same or at least similar number of pups to avoid possible nutritional stress for mothers and pups.The control manipulation consists in first removing the mother from the cage, then picking up control pups, reintroducing them in their home-cage and covering with home-cage bedding. At the end of this manipulation, which lasts 30 sec, the biological mother is reintroduced in the home cage. This control procedure takes place daily from PND1 to PND4, to assess possible effects of the handling procedure necessarily required by RCF protocol. It is not necessary that control females give birth exactly on the same day.# Procedure step by stepFor example, we consider 5 litters RCF and one CONTROL. We identify RCF mums with uppercase letters A, B, C, D and E, and respective pups with the same but lowercase letters a, b. c, d, and e. The control mum identification is F and respective pups f. To facilitate the procedure we record mum’s code on the home cage tag while the pups’ code is written on a smaller removable tag that can be transferred (together with pups) to the adoptive mother’s home-cage tag.First day (PND1)1.   Remove mum “A” from its home cage.2.  Remove pups “a” from the home cage and put them in a clean cage on hot plate (30-35^°C) to maintain body temperature.3.   Remove mum “B” from its home cage.4.   Move pups “b” from their home cage to the mum’s “A” cage, semi-cover pups with bedding and reintroduce mum “A” in its home cage.5.   Remove mum ^C^,, from its home cage.6.   Move pups “c” from their home cage to the mum’s “B” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “B” in its home cage.7.   Remove mum “D” from its home cage.8.   Move pups “d” from their home cage to the mum’s “C” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum ^*C\" in its home cage.9.   Remove mum “E” from its home cage.10.  Move pups “e” from their home cage to the mum’s “D” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “D” in its home cage.11.  Put pups “a” in the mum’s “E” cage, cover pups with some bedding and reintroduce mum “E” in its home   cage.The following days (PND 2,3,4) the procedure always starts from the mum “A”.The control manipulation consists in first removing the mother “F” from the cage, than picking up pups “f” and reintroducing them in their home-cage and covering with home-cage bedding. At the end of this manipulation, which lasts 30 sec, the biological mother “F” is reintroduced in the home cage. This manipulation is repeated for the PND1, PND2, PND3 and PND4.Home cage bedding was changed on postnatal day 10.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Mating Procedure\nHouse 2 females with one male for 15 days.\nExpose females to male odor a few days before mating to synchronize estrous cycles.\nCheck female weight at mating.\n## Pregnancy Assessment\nRemove males on the 15th day and weigh females to assess pregnant status.\nCheck for visible lateral 'bulges' in pregnant females.\nVerify weight gain, typically between 10 and 15 grams in 15 days.\n## Isolation and Birth Monitoring\nIsolate each pregnant female in a clean cage with bedding material.\nCheck daily for pups' birth (PND0).\n## RCF Manipulation Preparation\nEnsure at least 5 females give birth within 24 hours.\nPrepare adoptive dams with pups of the same age as fostered litters.\n## RCF Manipulation\n## PND0-PND4 Procedure\nRemove the mother from the cage.\nRemove the entire litter and introduce it into the home-cage of a different dam.\nSemi-cover the litter with the home-cage bedding of the adoptive mother and reintroduce the adoptive mother.\n## Rotation Scheme\nEach dam receives 4 different litters during the PND1-PND4 time interval.\nEach litter changes 4 different adoptive dams.\n## Control Manipulation\nRemove the mother from the cage.\nPick up control pups, reintroduce them into their home-cage, and cover with home-cage bedding.\nReintroduce the biological mother.\n## Step-by-Step Procedure Example\n## First Day (PND1)\nRemove mum 'A' from its home cage.\nRemove pups 'a' from the home cage and put them in a clean cage on a hot plate.\nMove pups 'b' from their home cage to the mum's 'A' cage.\nRepeat the process for mums 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'.\n## Following Days (PND2-4)\nRepeat the procedure starting from mum 'A'.\n## Home Cage Maintenance\nChange home cage bedding on postnatal day 10.","keywords":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1734"}}

Packed human erythrocytes collected in standard anticoagulant citrate dextrose (ACD) solution (either ≤ 24 hours post phlebotomy or ~ 5 day post phlebotomy) were obtained from Zen-Bio, Inc. 370–740 Megabecquerel (MBq) (1 ml) United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) were obtained from Cardinal Health. Vendor supplied human erythrocytes were centrifuged 1000g 10 minutes, and the remaining anticoagulant and buffy coat residual were gently aspirated. Erythrocytes were then gently washed in a 4X volume of filter sterilized “1X EDTA” solution (140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2.5 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt dihydrate (K2EDTA dihydrate)), centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes, and the wash was manually aspirated. 150 μl 1X EDTA solution was then added to the 250 μl washed erythrocytes and 100 μl (37–74 MBq) FDG to a final volume of 500 μl. For experiments using 500 μl packed erythrocytes, 400 μl 1X ETDA solution and 100 μl (37–74 MBq) FDG were added to a final volume of 1000 μl. Samples were then gently agitated on a platform rotator at either room temperature (~25° C) for 2 hours or at 37° C for 30 minutes to 2hours. Samples were then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was carefully aspirated. Erythrocytes were then washed and centrifuged twice with 4X volumes of 1X EDTA solution. For experiments characterizing residual unincorporated FDG, a 3rd wash/centrifugation step was performed. Final washed FDG-labeled erythrocytes were resuspended in 1X volume of 1X EDTA solution. Aliquots from all samples and washes were counted with the Atomlab 500 dose calibrator [Biodex Medical Systems, Inc].To measure FDG leakage from labeled erythrocytes, freshly phlebotomized venous blood from 4–6 month old male F344 (CDF) rats [Charles River] were collected and labeled with FDG using the previously described FDG labeling protocol. 250 μl of washed FDG-labeled rat erythrocytes were then incubated with 375 μl of rat plasma at 37° C for 30, 60, and 90 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged 1000g for 10 minutes, and counted with the Atomlab 500 dose calibrator. When accounting for additional time passage during the centrifugation step, sample activity measurements were made approximately 46 minutes, 76 minutes and 106 minutes after start of plasma incubation.To evaluate the degree of mechanical erythrocyte membrane damage induced by the centrifugation and washing steps in the cell labeling process, fresh rat venous blood samples were subjected to the previously described FDG erythrocyte cell labeling protocol, but with substitution of 1X EDTA buffer solution for FDG. The erythrocytes were then incubated with acetoxymethyl ester of calcein (calcein AM), a fluorescent marker of cell membrane integrity and viability [31]. Erythrocytes were also incubated with Annexin-V-phycoerythrin (Annexin V-PE), a fluorescent marker of early eryptosis [32]. In particular, 0.5–1.0 ml of venous blood was collected from 4–6 month old male F344 (CDF) rats [Charles River] into heparinized phlebotomy tubes. After mock FDG labeling of 250 μl of packed rat erythrocytes, approximately 4 x 105 rat erythrocytes in 40 μl 1X distilled phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 were incubated in 10 μl Annexin V-PE [BD Biosciences], 80 μM calcein AM dye, and 40 μl 1X Annexin V Binding Buffer [BD Biosciences] to a final volume of 100 μl at 37° C for 30 minutes in the dark. As control groups, unperturbed rat erythrocytes or unperturbed rat erythrocytes then treated with 20 mM CaCl2 were stained with both calcein AM and Annexin V-PE. Rat erythrocytes were then evaluated with flow cytometric analysis at the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) flow cytometry core facility.4–6 week old male splenectomized NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were placed in specialized housing for immunodeficient mice in the MCC vivarium. Approval for all animal experimentation was first obtained from the University of South Florida (USF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All animal experimentation was performed in accordance to federal regulations and USF IACUC principles and procedures. Animal imaging was performed in the MCC Small Animal Imaging Laboratory with an Inveon PET/CT [Siemens Medical Inc., Knoxville, Tennessee] preclinical scanner. Mice were either injected with FDG-labeled human erythrocytes (4 mice) or were injected with intravenous FDG (4 mice) prior to PET imaging. Mice were first fasted the night before microPET imaging and underwent phlebotomy of ≈ 200–250 μl whole blood via retro-orbital venous plexus puncture immediately prior to microPET imaging. Blood glucose from the phlebotomized blood was measured. A tail vein microcatheter was placed in each mouse under inhalational isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were maintained under inhalational anesthesia and immobilized on the microPET platform before injection of 500 μl of FDG-labeled erythrocyte suspension through the catheter. The PET portion of the system has 64 detector blocks with a total ield of view (FOV) of 12.7 cm and a spatial resolution of 1.4 mm. Raw PET data were acquired for 10 minutes in list-mode data format, followed by the CT attenuation correction scan. Imaging was started immediately after tail-vein injection of -FDG infused erythrocytes. The ECG signal in each mouse was detected with three flat electrodes placed on two front limbs and one hind limb of each animal (ground lead on a rear leg). The signals detected by these electrodes were recorded during the 10 minute time period by BioVet [m2m Imaging] physiological monitoring and heating system. The threshold for TTL cardiac gating signals was set in a rising mode of R-wave peak. The PET list-mode data was reconstructed using 3D-OSEM iterative algorithm with four iterations and eight subsets, with a final image volume of 256x256x256 voxels. Voxel effective dimensions were 1.4x1.4x1.4 mm. For each animal there were three data sets: standard 3-dimensional (3D) PET reconstruction, resulting in a motion—time average 3D PET image; dynamic 3D PET reconstruction with 30 frames; and the phase-based 4-dimensional (regular 3-dimensional plus time, 4D) PET cardiac reconstruction, with four cardiac gate binning. In all cases, CT attenuation correction was applied to the PET images.PET images of the mice were analyzed using Inveon Workstation Software [Siemens Medical Inc., Knoxville, Tennessee]. Vendor software-supplied Patlak compartment plot option was selected [33]. For 3D PET and 4D PET data sets, multiple volumes of interest (VOI) were selected manually, based on corresponding CT images including: heart, leg muscle, liver, kidney and brain. Voxel activities were represented in standardized uptake values (SUV). Dynamic activity curves were plotted for VOIs using dynamic 3D PET data set for each animal. The 4D PET data were used for defining cardiac function. First, the heart was segmented on CT images based on anatomical features; afterwards, the segmented volume (cardiac PET VOI) was transferred into co-registered PET images. All images in the manuscript represent maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstructions of the source data. With regards to images of the mouse head and neck, the whole body blood-pool activities were first segmented using SUVs in a range of 0.9–7.5. The resulting contoured data was then combined with MIP data render to improve small vessel conspicuity.All mice in the protocol are evaluated daily in the vivarium to assure well being where their behavior was observed for any signs of distress or illness. A few mice experienced transient distress during microPET image acquisition as perceived by intra-procedural tachypnea and tachycardia, during which inhalational anesthesia was carefully monitored and continuously titrated to reduce any perceived discomfort. These mice were also carefully monitored immediately after PET imaging, and noted to have quickly recovered from previous tachypnea and did not display signs of obvious discomfort, such as labored breathing or impaired movements. Immediately after imaging, mice were placed under a heating lamp and monitored for signs of distress for 1 hour. Breathing was monitored visually and recovery from inhalational anesthesia was assessed by response to sternal rubbing. After completion of the study, mice were euthanatized with an overdose of inhalational anesthesia, and death was verified by cessation of cardiovascular and respiratory movements during prolonged observation of at least 10 minutes, in accordance with USF IACUC protocol.The FDG radiolabeled erythrocytes were assumed to distribute uniformly throughout the blood pool within a few minutes of injection (“well-mixed” assumption). Dosimetry calculations were made under two scenarios. In the first scenario, it is assumed that there is no appreciable efflux of erythrocyte internalized FDG into the plasma during imaging and beyond. In essence, there is no assumed excretion and the entire injected dose is therefore considered to undergo physical decay within the model. It was also assumed there is no significant variation in blood pool specific activity related to decay while in transit to various organ sites. These assumptions result in a static biodistribution of radiotracer throughout the body, with the organ fraction of the injected dose being equal to the organ blood volume. In the second scenario, dosimetry values were calculated under conditions of poor FDG labeling of human erythrocytes, leading to a 25% urinary excretion of released/free FDG in vivo. The values for the organ blood volumes were obtained from ICRP Publication 89 [34].Human organ absorbed doses were estimated using the FDA approved OLINDA/EXM 1.1 [Vanderbilt University, TN] dosimetry software which contains several idealized human and tumor phantoms spanning both genders and various age groups [35,36]. Dose estimates were generated using the included reference adult male, based on the idealized Christy-Eckerman phantom [37].The Christy-Eckerman phantom (and therefore OLINDA/EXM 1.1) assumes the self-dose to the hollow organs (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract) arises from radioactive material within the lumen (i.e., ingested dose) rather than the viscus wall itself as would be expected with a blood pool agent. The assumption results in an erroneous calculation of the electron self-dose that can be corrected [38].","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6347438.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"A Novel Task for Studying Memory of Occasional Events in Rats","text":"A Novel Task for Studying Memory of Occasional Events in Rats\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# 1.  Subjects\n\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with European guidelines for care of laboratory animals (2010/63/EU) and received approval from the Lyon 1 University Ethics Committee (permission DR2015-46). Adult male Long-Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories) aged 7-8 weeks (300-350 g) at the start of the water deprivation protocol, are housed in groups of 2-4 per cage and kept in an environment with controlled temperature and humidity under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with food ad libitum. Experiments are conducted during the light period.\n\nNote: So far these experiments have not been conducted with other strains of rats or mice, but we assume that usage of other strains shouldn’t introduce major difficulties to carry out the experiments. Nevertheless, according to the fact that contexts are characterized  by  visual  stimulation,  working  with  albinos  rats  might  be  more challenging. Regarding mice, some adjustments to the experimental device would be required.\n\n# 2.  Odorants\n\nIn order to be delivered in a fully controlled manner through a new generation of olfactometer (Sezille et al., 2013), each odorant is introduced in a U-shaped Pyrex® tube (volume: 10 m ; length: 50~m m ; external diameter: 14~m m ) (VS technologies) filled with microporous granules. All odors used in these experiments were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, France (see a-f below).\n\na.  Geraniol (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 163333) 20% of saturated vapor pressure\nb.

Citral (cis ^+ trans) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: W230308) 20% of saturated vapor pressure = Odor D\n\nNote: Before the start of experiments, between 2 and 4 ml of pure odor solution are introduced gradually on several consecutive days into the U Shaped Glass Tubes until the microporous granules appear saturated (Figure 1) (for the experiments, the odors should be at saturated vapor pressure in the tube, at the same time in order to prevent olfactometer pollution it is important to avoid the accumulation of liquid at the bottom of the tube). The percentage of saturated vapor pressure introduced into the airflow is adjusted for each odor individually by the experimenter. The objective is to obtain an intensity that is perceived by the animal but moderate enough to prevent any avoidance behavior. For the different odors used in pairs, we also try to equalize their perceived intensity. The choice of these particular odors and concentrations was mainly determined by previous experiments in  the  lab  showing  their  easy  discriminability  and  the  absence  of  their  natural attractiveness or repulsiveness to the rats at the concentrations used (Martin et al., 2004; Courtiol et al., 2014; Torquet et al., 2014).\n\n()\nFigure 1.

Apparatus (EPISODICAGE)\n\nThe experimental cage is a PVC rectangular box ( 60×35×40cm ) equipped with 4 devices for delivery of different odor and drinking solutions (Figure 2A) (Belkacem Messaoudi). On the two opposing walls, at 5 cm distance from each corner of the box, the cage contains an arrangement of odor and drinking ports. The odor port is a round indentation into the wall angle5×5 cm in size), with a drinking port (small hole, 1×1 cm in size) placed 1cm below the odor port through which a drinking pipette can be inserted into the cage (Figure 1B).\n\n()\n\nFigure 2. The EPISODICAGE. A. General view of the experimental cage showing the four cameras installed above each of the four odor ports. B. Details of an odor port (OP) with associated drinking pipette (P), view from the inside (left figure) or the outside (right figure) of the cage: odor injection (OI) and odor extraction (OE), motor (M), which allows introducing and withdrawing the pipette from the cage. C. Each nose poke first triggers an odor delivery for 13 sec. Three seconds after odor initiation, a pipette containing various drinking solutions (water, sugar or quinine) is introduced into the cage for 10 sec until the odor stimulation switches off. Each lick on the pipette made by the rat is detected and recorded by the computer devoted to the control of the experimental cage. Each trial starts with the nose poke and ends with withdrawal of the pipette and odor switch off. D. On the left, appearance of the cage in the version used in routine sessions. The two other pictures illustrate how the appearance of the cage can be modified by projecting visual patterns on the ground (center picture) or introducing objects (right picture). Figure adapted from Veyrac et al. (2015).\n\n# a. Odor port\n\nWhen a rat makes a nose poke into the port, a capacitance change is detected by the system that immediately triggers for 13 sec the introduction of odor-saturated vapor into a constant airflow (air flow overall: 1 liter/min). The proportion of odorized air and the quality of the odorant are controlled through a custom made olfactometer connected to the odor port (OI) (Figure 1B). In a given experimental session, five different odors can be delivered at each of the four odor ports. A venturi-based system of aspiration allows extraction of the odorized air through a separate channel, so that the odor remains limited to the port (OE) (Figure 1B). A permanent compensation of OI and OE prevents any change in overall air pressure due to odor switch.\n\nNote: Rats are highly sensitive to changes in air pressure. To prevent any behavioral response to mechanical stimulation, air pressure must be kept at the same level during the presence and absence of odors.\n\nb.  Drinking port\n\nEach movable drinking pipette is connected to a pump. The pipette is introduced into the cage 3 sec after the first nose poke of the animal and is withdrawn from the cage 10 sec later simultaneously with termination of odor release (Figure 1C). This ensures that the odor stimulation is delivered during the entire liquid consumption. A second capacitance change sensor integrated into the drinking pipette detects every single lick of the animal and triggers the pump which in turn delivers a calibrated amount of 89~ul of drinking solution. The licks made by the rats are recorded as text files for later analysis of the results.\n\nNote: The amount of liquid delivered upon each lick from the drinking ports must be equal between the ports (the variation should be within 8pm1~mu l) , in order to avoid any preference of the animals for a particular port.\n\nDifferent drinking solutions can be delivered by the system, water, sucrose or quinine solutions according to the different phases of the protocol and the odor-port configurations. After each trial and retraction of the pipette, the drinking solution device is purged with the solution of the following trial.\n\nNote: Purge duration is set in a way that allows the complete wash out of the drinking solution of the last trial. This was verified through addition of ink into the water before the start of experiments.\n\n2.  Items for contextual enrichment during episodes\n\nAcoustic context\n\nDifferent types of sounds can be played through two loudspeakers symmetrically placed above the experimental arena to enhance the discriminability of the episodes: nature sounds, bird songs, piano music …etc. The general guideline for choosing these sounds was their discriminability as validated in spectrograms and the animals/experimenter’s well-being.\n\nTactile and visual context\n\nDifferent types of floors can be used with distinct tactile and visual characteristics (Figure 1D). As color vision in rats is poor, combinations of high-contrast black and white coloring of materials are preferred. Additionally, visual patterns can also be displayed on the floor by a video projector and various objects can be placed into the box.\n\n# 3.  Video recording\n\nFive cameras are used to monitor precisely the behavior of the rats, one placed centrally above the experimental box and four others each placed above the four odor ports. The position of the rat is detected online via a video tracking software from the signal recorded from the central camera. When the animal approaches a port, the corresponding camera is selected for signal acquisition. This allows us to save space occupied by the video files.\n\n# Software\n\n1.  VOLCAN (Marc Thevenet)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nAll the essential steps of the protocol are summarized in Figure 3. Prior to the start of the shaping procedures, rats are habituated to the experimenter and water deprivation is established.A.  Water deprivation protocolDuring the experiments, and most critically during the shaping period, the animals have to be motivated enough to activate the drinking device. This requires a controlled reduction of their access to water in the animal housing facility. It must not be too severe to preserve the animal in a good physiological state, but sufficient enough to keep them motivated in a controlled and stable way. One week after their arrival in the animal facility, when the animals are habituated to their new housing environment, we quantify daily ad lib water consumption for each individual cage by measuring the bottle weight before and after drinking. Water restriction is introduced progressively one week later: during the first 2 d of deprivation, a drinking pipette is accessible in their home cage for ^2~h~ in the morning (between 9 and 11 am) and in the evening (4 to 6 pm) respectively, then the access is reduced to 1h during the next 2 d and to 40 min during the following 7 d. All along this period, we control that the total amount of water consumed is close to the previous consumption during the ad lib period and consequently adjust the duration of the evening access. Additionally, the weight of the animals is periodically checked to ensure that it remains steady (pm5%) across the entire protocol. During behavioral experiments, if rats are tested in the morning, they receive water for 20-40 min only in the evening, but if they are tested in the afternoon, they receive water during 5 min in the morning and for 20-40 min in the evening. Moreover, evening access to water may be adjusted all along the experiments depending on the amount of water consumed by the animals in the experimental arena.Note: Within a 20 min period, rats are expected to perform at least 10 trials. For animals that do not perform the expected number of trials, and do not exhibit other signs than a lack of motivation, the access time to drinking water is reduced (e.g., from 40 to 20 min). Additionally, it is helpful to decrease the amount of drinking time on the day which precedes the first episode to increase the motivation of the rats and overcome stress which arises through exposure to a novel situation.Water consumption of the animals when water restriction has been established is estimated to around 20~m1/d . Upon water or sugar delivery, the rats make approximately 60 licks per trial, drinking 8~ul solution per lick, thus consuming around 10 ml in 20 trials. The time of free water access in the evening during the experimental period can therefore be adjusted in such a way that rats can consume at least 10-15 ml when the bottle is accessible for drinking.For the long-term test performed 24 days after the last episode presentation, water deprivation is interrupted at the end of the episode presentations and reinstalled one week prior to the test. It should also be slightly stricter than during exposure to the episodes, because by that time the rats spontaneously decrease their water consumption.# B.  ShapingNote: Because the time during which rats are exposed to the episodes is relatively limited, it is essential to minimize stress as much as possible in order to maximize behavioral exploration during episodes. Additionally, during shaping the protocol is adapted to each individual rat in order to start the episodic phase with a relatively homogenous group of rats in terms of their behavioral exploration.Habituation to the experimenterOne week after arrival of the rats the experimenter starts handling and playing with the rats for 5 min twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), first in the animal facility and later in the experimental room, which continues for 2-3 weeks until the start of the experiment. Handling should also be done for one week before the long-term test to ensure that the rats get used again to the experimenter (this time only in the animal facility).Note: Preferably the same person should carry out the experiments, since it is an episodic memory task and the experimenters might be associated to the context of the episode by the animals. If several experimenters are doing the experiments, one should then pay attention that the same experimenter is performing the episode session and corresponding test (e.g., Episode E1 and Test in the context Etau ).()Figure 3. The different phases of the protocol. A. Shaping: Rats are submitted to 11 sessions (1 per day) to habituate them to the cage and the pipette operating system (a nose poke into any of the four odor ports triggers, after a delay, a pipette delivering water (Apparatus shaping, 7 d). During a second phase of shaping, rats are also habituated to receive odor stimulations associated with sugar or quinine from the pipettes (Odors shaping, 4 d). Once shaping is completed, rats undergo 3 routine sessions (R, 1 session a day) with no odor, no enriched context, and only water available from the 4 ports. B. Episodes exposure: During each of these sessions (1 per day) the animals are exposed to 2 distinct episodes left, Episode 1 (E1) configuration; right, Episode 2 (E2) configuration with a 1 d routine (R) session in between, or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Episodes are presented once or twice in independent groups of rats. They were each characterized by a unique combination of odor-place-context associations rewarded with sugar solution (S): odor A at port 2 for E1; odor C at port 4 for E2, while the 3 other incorrect odor-place associations were associated with quinine solution (Q): odor B at port 2 and odors A and B at port 3 for E1; Odor D at port 4 and odors C and D at port 1 for E2. During episode exposures, in a given context (“in which context”), rats encoded at which port location (“where”), one of the odors (“what”) was associated with sugar solution. This configuration is referred to as P+O+ . C and D. Episodic memory tests. During the retrieval test ^24h or 24 days after the last episode session, rats are placed again in one of the context (E2, in this case) to evaluate what type of information they are able to recollect. The 2-port test (C) completely matches the episode in terms of context, odors and locations, except that only water (W) is delivered whatever place-odor configuration is experienced. The challenging 4-port test (D) is a more complex situation since it takes place in the context of E2, but with 4 accessible ports 2 previously associated with context E2 (“In context”, IC, in pink) and 2 associated with context E1 (“out of context”, OC, in blue). Each port is associated with a pair of odors that correspond to their respective episode.Shaping consists of two phases completed in an average of 11 daily sessions lasting 20 min at maximum. During this period, the appearance of the cage is relatively neutral (see Figure 3A): The floor is black and smooth and no odors, sounds or visual stimulation are used.1.  Phase 1 (apparatus shaping)The objective of this phase (5-7 d) is to teach the animal how to access water in the experimental environment. It includes several steps described in details below:Step 1: Rats housed in the same home cage are placed together into the experimental arena for 15 min with pipettes from all ports already introduced into the arena and ready to deliver water upon licking. This collective exploration period considerably reduces stress and facilitates the discovery of how to operate the drinking pipettes. This session is repeated the next day with the difference that rats are now placed into the experimental arena individually for 15 min. Once a rat licks from the pipette, we proceed to step B2, otherwise we repeat step B1.Step 2: At this stage, rats need to learn to trigger the introduction of the pipette into the cage by making a nose poke to the odor port. Odor ports are made as indentations into the walls of the cage, and the rats naturally come to explore them. At this stage the each pipette becomes accessible for drinking immediately after a nose-poke to the odor port and remains available for drinking for 20 sec. After this the pipette is automatically withdrawn from the cage and has to be triggered by the rat again after a refractory period (purge, duration: a few sec) which is set by the experimenter.Note: It is better to choose a short refractory period at the beginning of shaping procedures (e.g., 5 sec) in order to accelerate learning of the link between the nose-poke and the pipette accessibility. For the same reason, it is important for the pipettes to be accessible for a sufficient amount of time (20 sec) to be discovered by the rats. Indeed during this period, rats usually do not wait at a particular port, but are moving around from port to port. Once they have understood how to trigger the pipettes, the amount of time during which the pipettes are accessible is reduced to 10 sec for the following session. If at this stage a rat still does not know how to trigger the pipette, this step can be repeated. This learning unit is acquired once rats perform 10-20 trials (pipette triggering) in 20 min.Step 3: A 3 sec offset between nose-poke and pipette entry into the cage is introduced at this stage to habituate the rats to wait for the pipette in front of the port. 10-20 trials should be initiated by the rats in a 20 min session.Any of the 3 steps can be repeated for individual rats depending on their performance. 2.  Phase 2 (odor shaping)The objective of this phase is to habituate the animals to receive odor stimulations after the nose poke and use it as an indication for the nature of the drinking solution that will be delivered a few seconds later. During this phase, two different odors are used: Eugenol and Geraniol. Hereby, geraniol is always associated with sugar solution, while eugenol is always announcing the distribution of a bitter quinine solution. For a given trial, the same odor-solution combination is delivered in the four ports present in the experimental arena. Each daily session consisted of 15 to a maximum of 24 trials initiated by the rats in _20min . The session consists of a sequence of pseudo-randomly distributed geraniol and eugenol trials and is repeated on four consecutive days. The 3 sec delay between a nose-poke coupled with odor release and delivery of the pipette gives the animal some time to process the odor without being distracted by the pipette moving into the cage. Geraniol and eugenol are used uniquely in this shaping procedure.During this phase, the rats progressively learn that the odor coming from the odor port can be predictive of a positive or negative reward. As a consequence, their behavioral response is modified and they begin to avoid licking the quinine solution on the basis of eugenol cue. Depending on the rat, the odor shaping phase will take from 3 to a maximum of 4 d before such behavioral change is observed.Note: The first three trials of every shaping session are always positively reinforced in order to ensure that the animal receives sugar before quinine drinking solution and remains motivated throughout the session.# C.  Episodic task1.  Routine (Figure 3A)Prior to exposure to the episodes, rats undergo routine sessions for 3 consecutive days, with one session per day (Figure 3A). Each session consists of 12-24 trials performed in the same condition as step 3 of phase 1 of shaping. Routine sessions are thus characterized by a contextual environment with which rats are already familiar from shaping procedures (smooth black floor, no specific acoustic and visual ambiance), without any odors being released from the odor ports and with water as the only drinking solution. The objectives of the routine sessions are: First, to verify that there is an even licking distribution among the ports without any preference for a particular place; second, to further monitor and adjust water deprivation (especially when there is a delay between the shaping and the experimental phase due to e.g., some surgical procedures); and finally, to increase the memorability of the following episodes, by contrasting them to accustomed and highly familiar routine sessions.2.  Episodes (Figure 3B)Three essential characteristics distinguish episodes from routine sessions:a.  The context: The simple black and smooth floor of the cage used during shaping and routine sessions is replaced by various materials specific to each episode. Distinct visual patterns are displayed on the floor of the arena by a projector to increase discrepancy between different episodes. Acoustic ambiance is enriched through the playing of natural sounds or music through the loudspeakers. For example, Episode 1 is characterized by a smooth white floor, projection of whitetriangles on a dark background and sounds of crickets. Episode 2 is characterized by a granular white floor, projection of white background with black circles and sounds of birds singing in the rain.b.  Only two of the four ports of the cage can be activated by the rat in each episode, ports 2 and 3 for E1, and ports 4 and 1 for E2 (Figure 3). When a rat makes a nose poke to any of the two remaining non-active ports, nothing happens.c.  On the active ports of a given episode two novel odors are delivered. For simplicity, odor A and B in Episode 1 and odors C and D in Episode 2. As a consequence, in each episode, four different combinations of odor-place can be encountered. Among these possibilities, only one odor-place combination is rewarded with sugar solution whereas the three others are associated with quinine. For example, in E1, sugar will be delivered when odor A is presented in port 2 (referred to as P+O+ , positively reinforced place and odor). When odor B is presented on the same port, the animal will receive quinine (combination referred to as P+O- ). The two other combinations involving port 3 will also lead to quinine: Odor A on port 3 is referred as P-O+ and odor B on the same port as P-O-.Each episode session consists of 12-24 trials and lasts 20-40 min. As during the routine session, the animal is free to explore the environment. Consequently, the number of trials can vary depending on the exploratory motivation of the rat. The odors are presented at the assigned ports in a pseudorandom sequence with three repetitions of the same odor-port configurations every 12 trials. Episode sessions are separated by either one routine session (R) or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Depending on the experiments, each episode can be repeated once before the retention test, when more homogenous performance of the group is needed (e.g., when the effect of a drug is tested on episodic memory performance).To summarize:()Episode 1. Odor A (sigma+) is associated with a sugar drinking solution at port 2 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 3 (P-O+) . Odor B (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 2 (P+O-) and port 3 (P-O-).Episode 2. Odor C (0+) is associated with sugar drinking solution at port 4 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 1 (P-O+) . Odor D (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 4 (P+O-) and port 1 (P-O-).# 3.  Memory recall test (Figure 3C or 2D)The test can be performed ^24~h~ or 24 days after the last exposure to Episode 2 to probe recent or remote long-term memory, respectively. In both tests, quinine and sugar are replaced by water and performance of the rats is estimated by taking into account only the 12 first trials of the test. Two versions of the test that differ in their levels of difficulty can be carried out.2-Port Test: The test situation matches completely Episode 2 (Figure 3C). The same contextual environment as during the episode exposure is present. The same two ports are accessible and deliver the same two odors as during the corresponding episode (odors C and D, at ports 1 and 4).4-Port Test: The test takes place in the context corresponding to Episode 2 (same visual, auditory and tactile information), but this time all 4 ports are accessible for drinking, each delivering the same odors as during the corresponding episodes (Figure 3D). As during exposure to episode 2, ports 1 and 4 are releasing odors C and D and are therefore referred to as “In context” (IC) combinations, additionally ports 2 and 3 are releasing odors A and B, as during exposure to episode 1 and are referred to as “out of context” (OC) combinations.Note: One modification introduced to the original protocol is the removal of the routine sessions between the episodes. Instead of routine sessions the rats are kept in their home cages on the same water deprivation schedule as used before the shaping procedures ( 3O min access to water in the morning and evening). We didn’t notice a difference in performance between the two protocols (with either a routine session between the episodes, or one day rest in the home cage with maintained water deprivation) and recommend therefore the simpler version of the protocol which doesn’t include routine sessions between the episodes.Note: The level of difficulty of both tests can be additionally adjusted by using more overlapping or distinct contextual features, such as e.g. the flooring material of the experimental cage, or the chemical proximity of the odors.# AnalysisThe output files of the experiments contain the data about the total amount of licks done for each odor-port configuration on every single trial.1.  To normalize the measures of licking behavior across rats, the licks of all the trials that correspond to a specific odor-port configuration (e.g. P+O+ ) are summed up for a given rat and divided by the total amount of licks made by this rat in the respective session (lick ratio).2.  The group performance is determined by calculating the group mean of the ratios (calculated for each individual rat in step B1) by odor-port configuration, which is referred to as the licks index.3.  The same calculations can be performed by analyzing the number of times rats encountered each of the different odor-port configurations (referred to as visits). For this, trials performed on a given odor-port configuration are summed up and divided by all the trials made in a session for each individual rat, from which the group mean performance is calculated.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Water Deprivation Protocol\nHabituate rats to the experimenter and establish water deprivation.\nQuantify daily ad lib water consumption for each individual cage.\n## Introduce Water Restriction\nRestrict access to water for 2 hours in the morning and evening for the first 2 days.\nReduce access to 1 hour for the next 2 days and 40 minutes for the following 7 days.\nAdjust evening access based on water consumption during experiments.\nMonitor animal weight to ensure it remains steady across the protocol.\n## Shaping\n## Habituation to the Experimenter\nHandle and play with rats for 5 minutes, twice a day, for 2-3 weeks.\nRepeat handling for one week before the long-term test.\n## Apparatus Shaping\n## Step 1: Collective Exploration\nPlace rats in the experimental arena with pipettes for 15 minutes.\nRepeat with individual rats the next day.\n## Step 2: Learn to Trigger Pipettes\nMake pipettes accessible after a nose-poke to the odor port.\nReduce pipette accessibility time to 10 seconds once rats understand the link.\n## Step 3: Introduce Offset\nAdd a 3-second delay between nose-poke and pipette entry.\nEnsure rats perform 10-20 trials in 20 minutes.\n## Odor Shaping\nHabituate rats to odor stimulations associated with sugar or quinine.\nUse geraniol for sugar and eugenol for quinine, with a 3-second delay before pipette delivery.\nRepeat for 3-4 days until rats show behavioral change based on odor cues.\n## Episodic Task\n## Routine Sessions\nConduct 3 consecutive days of routine sessions without odors or enriched context.\nMonitor licking distribution and adjust water deprivation as needed.\n## Episodes\nPresent episodes with distinct context, odors, and rewards.\nUse different materials, visual patterns, and acoustic ambiance for each episode.\nLimit accessible ports and associate specific odors with sugar or quinine.\n## Memory Recall Test\n## 2-Port Test\nMatch the test situation to Episode 2, with the same context and odors.\nDeliver water instead of quinine or sugar, and estimate performance based on the first 12 trials.\n## 4-Port Test\nConduct the test in the context of Episode 2, but with all 4 ports accessible.\nDeliver the same odors as during the corresponding episodes, and estimate performance based on the first 12 trials.\n## Analysis\nNormalize licking behavior across rats by calculating the lick ratio for each odor-port configuration.\nDetermine group performance by calculating the group mean of the lick ratios.\nOptionally, analyze the number of visits to each odor-port configuration instead of licks.","keywords":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1740"}}

G0GA88) was cloned into the vector pCGFP-BC (Kawate and Gouaux, 2006) between the restriction sites for HindIII and XhoI, which adds 19 residues from the multiple cloning sites to the N terminus of the channel. These residues do not affect the channel function but help with the expression and stability of the final, purified protein. Small-scale expression and detergent screens were performed with fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (Kawate and Gouaux, 2006), in which the supernatant from a crude extract was applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 200 µM cAMP, pH 7.4, and 2× critical micellar concentration of different detergents. After the initial screening, the GFP gene and four histidine residues from the octa-histidine tag were deleted from the vector by Quikchange (Agilent Technologies) mutagenesis, and protein expression was performed in E. coli C41 (DE3; Lucigen). Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37°C to an OD600nm of 0.4, transferred to 20°C, and further grown to an OD600nm of 0.8, when protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Subsequent steps were all performed at 4°C, except for the final size-exclusion chromatography, which was performed at room temperature. Cells from 4-liter cultures were resuspended in 50 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, at room temperature; 100 mM KCl; and 200 µM cAMP) supplemented with PMSF (85 µg/ml), leupeptin/pepstatin (0.95/1.4 µg/ml), DNaseI (1 mg; MilliporeSigma), lysozyme (1 mg; MilliporeSigma), and cOmplete ULTRA mini protease inhibitor (Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication with a Sonic Dismembrator 500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membrane proteins were extracted and solubilized with 30 mM n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace) for 1.5 h at 4°C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 36,000 g for 45 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm filter and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP Co2+ column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), preequilibrated with purification buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 200 µM cAMP, and 0.5 mM DDM). Proteins not specifically bound were removed by washing the column with 15-column volumes of purification buffer containing 30 mM imidazole before SthK was eluted with purification buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluate was concentrated to 10 mg/ml with an Amicon ultra concentrator (MilliporeSigma) with a 100-kD cutoff before loading the sample on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) preequilibrated in purification buffer, unless otherwise noted. The peak fraction containing purified SthK was collected for further structural and functional studies. The final protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 55,900 M−1 cm−1. The ratio A260/A280 was used as a criterion to estimate the cAMP content in the sample.Fluorescence binding assayTo measure the binding constants of cAMP and cGMP for SthK, the cAMP used during purification needed to be removed. Because the apo-SthK in detergent is prone to aggregation, we exchanged DDM for amphipol (A8-35; Anatrace) for equilibrium titrations. After concentrating the eluted protein from the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column, amphipol A8-35 hydrated in double-distilled H2O was added (1:3 wt/wt, protein/amphipol) and the protein–amphipol mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 h under gentle agitation. Subsequently, the sample was applied to a detergent-removal column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 GL) in 20 mM HEPES and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4 (without detergent and cAMP). The absorbance ratio A260/A280 of the final sample was typically 0.52. For comparison, the same absorbance ratio for a cAMP-containing sample was 0.72.Fluorescence titrations in equilibrium were performed in 20 mM HEPES and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4, at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrometer (Photon Technology International) and the fluorescent cAMP/cGMP analogues 8-NBD-cAMP/cGMP (fcAMP/fcGMP; Biolog). The fluorescence of 0.1 µM fcAMP/fcGMP was measured at 536 nm after excitation at 463 nm (5 nm bandwidth each) upon titration with increasing concentrations of SthK in A8-35, with the concentration of fcAMP/fcGMP kept constant. According to a stoichiometric complex formation (Eq. 1 and 2) in equilibrium, in which each monomer of SthK can bind one molecule of ligand, and considering mass conservation, the fluorescence was correlated to the extent of the complex formation (Eq. 3), and the data were fitted according to (Wilkinson, 2004) to obtain the apparent Kd value for the interaction between 8-NBD-cAMP/cGMP and SthK:SthK+cNMP⇄SthK⋅cNMP(1)Kd=[SthK]⋅[cNMP][SthK⋅cNMP](2)F=Fmin+(Fmax−Fmin)⋅[SthK⋅cNMP][cNMP]0(3)and F([SthK])=Fmin+(Fmax-Fmin)·([SthK]0+[cNMP]0+Kd)-(-[SthK]0-[cNMP]0-Kd)2-4·[SthK]0·[cNMP]02·[cNMP]0(4)where [SthK] and [cNMP] are the concentrations of the free, interacting partners; [SthK · cNMP] is the complex of both; Fmin and Fmax are the minimum and the maximum fluorescence, respectively; [SthK]0 and [cNMP]0 are the total concentrations of the interacting molecules in micromolars; and Kd is the dissociation constant in micromolars.For competition experiments, 0.3 µM fcAMP, mixed with 0.3 µM SthK in A8-35, was titrated with increasing amounts of nonfluorescent cAMP or cGMP, keeping the concentrations of fcAMP and SthK constant. Fluorescence was monitored at 536 nm after excitation at 463 nm (5-nm bandwidth each). Because the measured signal change in this case reflects the binding equilibria between the channel and two ligands (Eq. 5), the binding term is a more complex, cubic function (Wilkinson, 2004; Cukkemane et al., 2007; for derivation, see Wang, 1995). Data analysis was performed by solving the depressed cubic function for the real root (Eq. 6; Wang, 1995; Wilkinson, 2004; Cukkemane et al., 2007), giving the apparent affinities for both the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent ligands. It is important to point out that, in the simplified model (Eq. 5), SthK describes a single subunit in the tetramer:SthK⋅cNMP+fcAMP⇄SthK+fcAMP+cNMP⇄SthK⋅fcAMP+cNMP(5)andF=Fmin+(Fmax−Fmin)⋅2⋅(a2−3b)⋅cos(θ3)−a3⋅Ka+[2⋅(a2−3b)⋅cos(θ3)−a](6)with Eq. 7:θ=arccos ⋅−2a3+9ab−27c2⋅(a2−3b)3(7)where a = Ka + Kb + [At ] + [Bt] − [Pt]; b = Kb ∙ ([At ] − [Pt]) + Ka ∙ ([Bt ] − [Pt]) + Ka ∙ Kb; c = −Ka ∙ Kb ∙ [Pt ]; F is the monitored fluorescence; Fmin and Fmax are the minimum and maximum fluorescence, respectively; [At], [Bt], and [Pt] are the total concentrations of the fluorescent ligand, the nonfluorescent ligand, and the receptor concentration in micromolars, respectively; and Ka and Kb are the binding constants in micromolars of the fluorescent and nonfluorescent ligands, respectively.Channel reconstitution and rubidium flux assaysImmediately after gel filtration, SthK was reconstituted into liposomes (Heginbotham et al., 1998). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG), and 18:1 cardiolipin in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and POPG in chloroform were mixed at a ratio of 5:3:2 (wt/wt/wt) or 3:1 (wt/wt), respectively, and dried under nitrogen flow. Lipids were resolubilized with 34 mM CHAPS (3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate) in reconstitution buffer (10 mM HEPES, 400 mM KCl, and 5 mM NMG [N-methylglucamine gluconate], pH 7.6) to a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. After mixing with 30 µg SthK per milligram of solubilized lipids, detergent was removed by applying the sample (500 µl) to an 18-ml detergent-removal column (Sephadex G-50 fine beads, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Proteoliposomes were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Liposomes without SthK were prepared in parallel as a control for each flux experiment.The 86Rb+ flux assay was performed as described earlier (Nimigean, 2006). In brief, the extra-liposomal solution was exchanged by passing 100 µl of liposomes through 1.5 ml G50 spin columns (Sigma) equilibrated with sorbitol buffer (10 mM HEPES, 400 mM sorbitol, 4 mM NMG, pH 7.6, and 5 µM KCl) containing the same cAMP or cGMP concentrations as inside the liposomes. Radioactive uptake was initiated by adding sorbitol buffer containing 86Rb+ (1 µCi/ml) to the liposomes. 100-µl samples were taken at the desired time points and passed through 1.5-ml Dowex cation exchange columns equilibrated with 400 mM sorbitol to remove the extraliposomal 86Rb+. At the end of each experiment, 1 µg/ml valinomycin was added to the remaining liposomes to determine the maximum amount of 86Rb+ uptake, to which all measurements from an individual experiment were normalized. Scintillation fluid was added to each sample, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. All experiments were performed in triplicates.Stopped-flow fluorescence flux assaysKinetics of SthK response to cyclic nucleotides were monitored with a sequential-mixing, stopped-flow fluorescence-ensemble assay (Rusinova et al., 2014; Posson et al., 2018) based on the Tl+-induced quenching of a liposome-encapsulated fluorescent dye (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid [ANTS], disodium salt; Life Technologies). For this assay, the gel filtration was performed in 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM KNO3, and 0.5 mM DDM, pH 7.4. To reconstitute SthK into liposomes, DOPC, POPG, and cardiolipin (Avanti Polar Lipids), dissolved in chloroform, were mixed in a 5:3:2 (wt/wt/wt) ratio and dried under constant N2 flow in disposable glass tubes to a thin layer. Lipids were further dried overnight under vacuum and then solubilized (10 mg/ml final concentration) in reconstitution buffer (15 mM HEPES and 150 mM KNO3, pH 7.4) in the presence of 33 mM CHAPS. ANTS was added to a final concentration of 25 mM before adding SthK (30 µg/mg lipid). Detergent removal was performed by incubating the reconstitution mixture with 0.75 g BioBeads (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for 3 h under constant agitation. Subsequently, the solution was separated from the BioBeads, sonicated for 20 s, and extruded (Mini Extruder, 0.1-µm membrane; Avanti Polar Lipids). The liposome solution was run over a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), equilibrated in recording buffer (10 mM HEPES and 140 mM KNO3, pH 7.4) to remove extravesicular ANTS. For the measurements, liposomes were diluted fivefold in recording buffer to ensure a good signal/noise ratio.All measurements were performed with a SX20 sequential-mixing, stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) at 25°C. In the first mixing step, liposomes were diluted 1:1 with recording buffer containing ligands to activate SthK. After incubating the solution for the defined times (0.015–10 s), a second 1:1 mixing step was performed with quenching buffer (10 mM HEPES, 90 mM KNO3, and 50 mM TlNO3, pH 7.4) containing ligand at the same concentration. Quenching of the ANTS fluorescence by Tl+ was monitored above 450 nm after excitation at 360 nm. For each condition, at least eight repeats were performed. Reference measurements were performed with recording buffer instead of quenching buffer. All experiments were repeated at least three times with protein from different reconstitutions. Identical control measurements were performed with protein-free liposomes. The day-to-day performance, as seen in the rate constants, was within 20%.To assess the time course of SthK activation by cAMP, a final concentration of 200 µM cAMP was used. Delay times after the first mixing step were varied between 15 ms and 10 s to cover a wide range of incubation times. To determine the apparent activation constant 50% effective concentration (EC50) of cAMP for SthK, the concentrations of cAMP in the recording and quenching buffers varied between 0 and 400 µM. The delay time was kept constant at 2.5 s to ensure SthK was activated completely under each condition. The apparent 50% inhibition constant IC50 of cGMP for SthK was determined by mixing apo-SthK with 200 µM cAMP and increasing concentrations of cGMP (0–1 mM) at the same time for 2.5 s before performing the second mixing step with quenching buffer and the final cAMP/cGMP concentrations. Because we performed the reconstitution in the absence of cAMP, the SthK channels with the CNBDs facing inside of the liposomes were closed and did not contribute to the quenching kinetics.Stopped-flow data analysisFluorescence quenching data were analyzed as described (Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010; Rusinova et al., 2014; Posson et al., 2018). In brief, a stretched-exponential function (Eq. 8) was fitted to the first 100 ms of fluorescence decay (liposome size distribution and different numbers of channels per liposome do not allow for mono- or double-exponential fits):Ft=F∞ + (F0−F∞)⋅e[−(tτ)β](8)where Ft is the fluorescence at time t; F∞ and F0 are the final and initial fluorescence, respectively; τ is the time constant of the quenching reaction; and β is the stretched-exponential coefficient.The rate of Tl+ influx at 2 ms, referred to as the Tl+ flux rate in the text, was calculated using Eq. 9 and the parameters from the stretched-exponential fits:kt=(βτ)⋅(2 msτ)β−1(9)where kt is the rate at 2 ms in s−1. This rate is dependent on many parameters, such as the number of channels per liposome, the liposomal size, the open probability of the channels, the conductance of the channels, and the rate of activation/inactivation.To analyze the time course of SthK activation by cAMP, the averaged Tl+ flux rates were plotted as functions of the delay time, and an exponential function was used to fit the data. The EC50 value was estimated by plotting the averaged Tl+ flux rates as a function of the cAMP concentration and fitting the data with a modified Hill equation (Eq. 10) toy([cAMP])=kmax⋅[cAMP]nH(EC50)nH+[cAMP]nH(10)where kmax is the maximum rate at the saturating ligand concentration, [cAMP] is the concentration of cAMP in micromolars, EC50 is the concentration at half the activation in micromolars, and nH is the Hill coefficient.The IC50 value for the inhibition of SthK by cGMP in the presence of 200 µM cAMP was calculated by assuming that cGMP was a competitive antagonist of cAMP, using Eq. 11:y([cGMP]f)=ymax1+([cGMP]IC50)s(11)where ymax is the maximum SthK activity in the presence of only cAMP, [cGMP] is the respective concentration of cGMP in micromolars, IC50 is the apparent inhibition constant in micromolars, and s is the slope factor.The IC50 values were used to calculate an apparent inhibition constant Ki (Eq. 12; Cer et al., 2009) based on a model similar to the one described in Eq. 5:Ki=IC50[cAMP]Kd+1(12)where IC50 is the inhibition constant obtained from Eq. 11, [cAMP] is the concentration of cAMP present during the inhibition experiment, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant for cAMP obtained from Eq. 6.ElectrophysiologySingle-channel recordings of SthK were performed as described previously (Thompson et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2011) in a horizontal lipid-bilayer setup at room temperature where the cis (upper) and trans (lower) chambers were separated by a partition with a 100-µm-diameter hole (LeMasurier et al., 2001). Bilayers are painted over the hole with a smooth capillary glass stick and 6.25 mg/ml of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine dissolved in n-decane. The prefrozen proteoliposomes were briefly sonicated (~2 s) before application to the cis side of the bilayer. The electrophysiology buffer contained 97 mM KCl, 3 mM KOH, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7. Ligand exchange was performed by perfusing electrophysiology buffer containing different concentrations of cAMP or cGMP into the trans chamber to measure various activity levels of SthK. cAMP-free solutions in the cis chamber ensured that we only recorded from channels with their CNBDs facing the trans chamber. Channel activity was monitored with an Axopatch 200A or B (Molecular Devices). Electrophysiology traces were filtered online at 1 kHz with an eight-pole, low-pass Bessel filter, digitized at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices), recorded with Clampex (Molecular Devices), and analyzed with Clampfit (version 10; Molecular Devices). Amplitudes of long openings were measured manually, and the results were confirmed by all-amplitude histograms (Fig. S3). The concentration for half-maximal activation, EC50, for cAMP, was determined with Eq. 10, and the apparent inhibition constant for cGMP was determined with Eq. 11. The change in open probability with the voltage was fitted with a Boltzmann function (Eq. 13):Po(V)=Pomax−Pomin1+e[−F⋅z⋅(V−Vhalf)R⋅T]+Pomin(13)where F is the Faraday constant, z is the gating charge, Vhalf is the voltage at half activation, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, and Pomax and Pomin are the fitted maximum and minimum open probabilities, respectively.Negative-stain EM imaging and analysis3 µl of freshly prepared protein (10 µg/ml) was applied to a glow-discharged (15 mA, 1 min, easiGlow; PELCO), homemade, carbon-coated copper grid (400 mesh; Electron Microscopy Sciences) and incubated for 60 s. The grid was washed four times with double-distilled H2O, and excess water was removed by blotting after each step. The grid was dipped into 1.5% uranyl acetate stain for 1 s, then blotted and stained again for an additional 20 s. Excessive stain was removed by blotting, and the grid was air dried for 5 min. This protocol was adapted from Ohi et al. (2004).The prepared grids were imaged in an FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV acceleration voltage, equipped with a Tietz F416 camera (2,048 × 2,048 pixels). Micrographs were obtained at a magnification of 49,000 with Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005), resulting in a pixel size of 3.44 Å/pixel. Particles were selected with DoG Picker (Voss et al., 2009), included in the Appion (Lander et al., 2009; Voss et al., 2010) processing package. Extracted particle images were subjected to iterative rounds of 2-D classification with RELION 2.1 (Scheres, 2012; Kimanius et al., 2016).Online supplemental materialFig. S1 provides a sequence alignment of SthK with CNG and HCN channels showing the homology to its eukaryotic counterparts.

Secure the pipette tip to the stereotaxic holder arm, and then connect the pipette using PVC tubing to a syringe attached to a 3-way stopcock valve. Put a drop of a virus solution (at least 2~ul per mouse) on a clean surface covered with paraffin to avoid breaking the pipette tip. Move the stereotaxic holder arm to touch the pipette tip to the drop of virus solution and then pull on the syringe to slowly apply negative pressure and fill the pipette with virus solution. Keep the pipette with the virus solution in a closed box, with wet paper towels in the bottom to maintain humidity, until you are ready to inject. Any surfaces in contact with the virus should be cleaned with 10% bleach solution.()Figure 1. Images of the glass pipette used for the intracranial injection of the virus solution.

Schematic of the setup using a solenoid valve to deliver time-controlled pulses of compressed air for the administration for the virus through a glass pipetteB.  Surgery and virus injection (time 20-30 min)1.  Administer a subcutaneous injection in the neck of caprofen (5 m g/k g) pre-operatively for preemptive analgesia and for its anti-inflammatory actions.2.  Anesthetize the mouse with a solution containing ketamine (100m g/k g) and xylazine (10  m g/ k g) . If the mouse weighs less than 20 , administer half the dose. Administer the drugs via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at volumes of 10ml/kg .3.  Shave the scalp with the hair clipper.4.  Apply Puralube VET ointment to the eyes.5.  Place the mouse on a heating pad (37^°C) , secure the nose in the mouth bar and nose clamp and stabilize the head using the ear bars.6.  Clean the skin above the skull, first with betadine and then with alcohol.7.  Apply lidocaine solution using a Q-tip.8.  Using a scalpel blade, make an incision and push the skin covering the skull to the side.9.  Attach a piece of metal tubing to the stereotaxic probe holder and mark the skull using coordinates targeting the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For mice weighing more than 25 use the following coordinates: anterior-posterior (AP) - 3.4m m and lateral (L) -/+ 0.5 mm relative to bregma, and dorsoventral (D V)4.5m m from the dura. Adjust the coordinates to A P-3.0 mm and D V-4.1 m m for mice weighing between 12 and 16 , and to A .P-3.3m m and D V-4.3m m for mice weighing between 17 and 24 9 . Do not use the glass pipette to mark the coordinates on the skull, since the tip can easily break.10. Drill holes on both sides and clean the exposed skull with saline.11. Place the glass pipette with the virus solution in the probe holder of the stereotaxic apparatus and connect the pipette to the solenoid valve using PVC tubing (see schematic in Figure 1). Before lowering the pipette into the brain, make sure that the timed solenoid-controlled pulses of compressed air are efficiently ejecting the virus solution. If the virus solution is not coming out, gently clean the pipette tip using a Kimwipe saturated with saline.12. Gently pierce the dura with a needle before lowering the pipette.13. Slowly (approximately 0.2 mm per sec) lower the pipette to the target depth + 0.1 m m . Then raise the pipette 0.1m m to the target depth (4.3m m) ). This creates a pocket for the viral solution and reduces needed pressure when delivering the virus solution. Inject 1~ul of the virus solution per side using timed solenoid-controlled pulses of compressed air.14. Leave the pipette in place for 3 min after the injection to reduce back flux along the injection track, and then withdraw it.15. After both injections, clean the skull with saline, push the skin together with a forceps, and close the scalp incision with Vetbond, allow it to cure (1 min), and then apply Neosporin ointment. Then, remove the animal from the stereotaxic apparatus.16. Administer Carprofen daily for 3 days to alleviate pain.# Part II: Determining efficacy and selectivity of the ChR2 expression in dopamine neurons using immunofluorescenceViral transfection delivers multiple copies of ChR2 and induces strong expression. However, ChR2 expression varies among animals so the specificity and efficacy of the transfection needs to be determined and taken into account when determining a functional connectome. Visualization of immunostaining of brains sections for the EYFP tag enables tracing dopaminergic projections, assessing their dopaminergic status and by guiding recordings provides a comprehensive basis for systematic recordings.# Materials and Reagents1 Multi-well plates (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1219C16)2 Petri dishes (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1182N84)3  Coverslips (e.g., Corning, catalog number: 2980-245)4 Microscope slides coated (e.g., Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1178T40)5 Ketamine HCl (KetaVed, Vedco)6 Xylazine (Akorn, AnaSed®)7 Heparin (Swiss Vault Engine, catalog number: 25021-400-66)8 Phosphate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: P3619)9  Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: D5652)10 Glycine (molecular weight: 75.07) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 410225)11 Normal donkey serum (EMD Millipore, catalog number: S30-100mL)12 Triton (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: X100)13 Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against green fluorescence protein (GFP) (EMD Millipore, catalog number: AB3080), which recognizes enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP)14 Mouse monoclonal antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (EMD Millipore, catalog number: MAB318), which recognizes a specific marker of dopamine neurons15 Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, catalog number: A-21206)16 Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 594 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, catalog number: A-21203)17 Prolong Gold mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Molecular ProbesTM, catalog number: P36930)18 Paraformaldehyde (PFA, 16% ) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, catalog number: 15710)19 Glycerol (molecular weight: 92.09) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: G5516)20 Ethylene glycol (molecular weight: 62.07) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 324558)21 Tris HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: T2413)# Equipment1 Brush (small paint brush)2 Vibrating microtome (Leica Biosystems Nussloch, model: VT1200S)3 Laboratory shaker (Benchmark Scientific, model: BlotBoy)4 Slide storage boxes (Thomas Scientific, catalog number: 1202N78)5 Confocal scanning microscope (Olympus, model: Fluoview FV1000)# Software1.

Carbon dioxide inhalation was used for euthanasia.Mirc24tm1Mtm/ Mmjax, the “knockout first” mouse strain of miR-322 and miR-503, was obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Stock No: 017513) [12]. The male Mirc24tm1Mtm/ Mmjax mice were mated with the female Tg(Sox2-Cre) mice to generate female heterozygous knockout mice (miR-322/503-/+) of miR-322 and miR-503 (Fig 1). Next, miR-322/503-/+ mice were mated with wildtype male B6;129 mice to generate hemizygous male knockout mice (miR-322/503-/Y). Heterozygous female knockout embryos (miR-322/503-/+) were generated by mating the miR-322/503-/Y mice with wildtype female Swiss (SW) mice. As the KO allele carries a LacZ expression cassette upstream of the coding sequence of miR-322 and miR-503 (“knockout first”), β-galactosidase serves as the reporter of miR-322 and miR-503 expression.10.1371/journal.pone.0176915.g001Fig 1Schematic diagram of the miR-322/503 knockout locus and the mating schedule.(A) Mirc24tm1Mtm/ Mmjax mice were crossed with Tg(Sox2-Cre) mice. Due to the presence of three LoxP sites, there were three possible alleles resulted from Cre-mediated recombination. We selected the one (dotted-box) with the miR-322/503 stemloop ablated to carry out further mating and named it “miR-322/503 KO”. (B) E8.5 embryos were produced from mating of male hemizygous knockout of miR-322/503 (miR-322/503-/Y) with female wildtype SW mice. Half of the embryos are expected to be heterozygous knockout female mice (miR-322/503-/+) and also LacZ positive.The miR-451 promoter-LacZ is a transgenic mouse strain with the LacZ gene under the control of the 5-kb promoter of miR-144/451 [16]. miR-451 promoter-LacZ positive embryos were obtained by mating male transgenic miR-451 promoter-LacZ mice with wildtype female SW mice.The embryos were termed at embryo collection time. The start points of gestation were approximated to the middle time of the dark cycle just before the first observed vaginal plug. LacZ genotyping was determined by PCR primers: forward, 5’-CTCAAACTGGCAGATGCACGGT-3’; reverse, 5’-CGTTGCACCACAGATGAAACGC-3’.β-galactosidase stainingX-gal (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, Goldbio) was dissolved in dimethylformamide at 50 mg/ml. S-gal (6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO at 50 mg/ml. The X-gal/FeCN and S-gal/TNBT methods include three steps each: fixation (F), wash (W), and chromogenic staining (S). In the X-gal/FeCN method, the embryos were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 minutes for E8.5 embryos and 30 minutes for E10.5 embryos (F1). Next, the embryos were washed three times with wash buffer (0.02% NP-40, 0.01% deoxycholate in PBS) for 15 minutes each (W1).

In the S-gal/TNBT method, the embryos were fixed in the fixation solution (0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2% formalin, 5 mM EGTA and 2 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)) for 15 minutes for E8.5 embryos and 30 minutes for E10.5 embryos (F2). Next, the embryos were washed three times with rinse solution (0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% IGEPAL, 2 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)) for 20 minutes each (W2). Finally, the embryos were incubated in staining solution (1 mg/ml Salmon gal and 0.4 mM TNBT in rinse solution) at 37°C (S2). S2 is monitored every 10 minutes and up to 3 hrs until specific staining appeared [17]. Both S1 and S2 steps were performed in a humidified chamber to prevent evaporation. We explored the different combinations of the three steps, as reported in Table 1.

Prepare dissection medium and culture medium in a laminar flow hood.3.  Pre-acclimatise culture medium to 37^°C in incubator.4.  Swab the tissue chopper with 70% ethanol and secure a fresh razor blade in place, which has been wiped first with acetone to remove any grease and then swabbed with 70% ethanol.5.  Make up fresh sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid.6.  Terminally anaesthetise mouse, aged between 8-20 days by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60m g/k g) . When all pedal withdrawal reflexes have ceased and there is no response to a strong pinch of the hind limb, nor a corneal reflex, the animal is considered to be sufficiently anaesthetised for the procedure.7.  Open the chest up and cut away the rib cage to expose the heart. A trans-cardiac perfusion is then performed through the left ventricle with ^25ml of ice cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid to enhance viability of slices. This is illustrated by Gage et al. (2012). Note: This procedure is carried out using fixative and for this protocol, sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid is administered via a syringe – a pump system is not required.8.  Remove the dorsal skin and perform a dorsal laminectomy to expose the spinal cord. Remove the spinal cord using fine spring scissors and fine forceps and place in a 50~m m Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium (Figure 2). This is procedure is illustrated in a video taken from Gunther et al. (2012). Note: In this example the procedure is carried on fixed tissue. For organotypic slice cultures the spinal cord must not be placed in paraformaldehyde solution after it has been dissected free but in cold dissection medium.()Figure 2. A series of images depicting the dissection of the spinal cord9.  Remove the meninges (pia, arachnoid and dura mater) under a dissecting microscope, using fine forceps. Select the mid-lower thoracic/upper lumbar region of the spinal cord (approximately T8-L2; Figure 3).()Figure 3. Removing the meninges from the spinal cord. A. A diagram displaying the meninges (taken from Medical Dictionary, accessed May 2016); B. An image depicting removal of the meninges; C. A diagram displaying the region selected for culture.10. Transfer the selected region of spinal cord, using a microspatula, onto a sterile filter paper moistened with dissection medium that is situated on the plate of the tissue chopper and cut 300um transverse slices.11. Transfer the slices, using a microspatula, to a Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium, this will remove any excitotoxic chemicals and debris.12. Under a dissection microscope using fine forceps and a microspatula, separate the slices and discard any damaged slices. Note: All procedures from this point onwards are performed in a laminar flow hood.13. Pipette 1 ml of pre-acclimatised culture medium into each well of a sterile 6-well culture plate and, using sterile forceps, place a millicell organotypic filter insert on top of the culture medium.14. Immediately following this, using a Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip that has had the end cut off to widen the diameter (thus limiting damage to the slices), transfer 2 to 6 slices onto each filter. Care must be taken that the slices are not touching each other or the side of the filter. Remove all excess medium from around the slice by means of a Gilson pipette with sterile tip; ensure there is no medium above the filter (Figure 4).()Figure 4. Method for preparing organotypic slice culture15. Transfer culture plate to the incubator, where slices are maintained at 37~^°C under standard conditions; 100% humidity, 95% air, 5% C O_2 enriched environment.16. After ^24~h~ in culture, using sterile forceps to lift the organotypic filter insert carefully out of the well, remove culture medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip and replace the culture medium with 1~ml of serum-free medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip. Carefully place filter back onto the fresh medium, ensuring that there are no air bubbles under the filter. The serum is required initially, as it aids the slices in recovery from the trauma of explantation. The key advantage of changing to serum free medium is that the exact constituents can be determined. Serum may also contain substances that influence the growth of a particular population of cells and may promote microglial proliferation (Coltman and Ide, 1996).17. For the remaining time in culture, remove half the medium (0.5m) ) and replace with 0.5ml of fresh serum free medium, every second day. This technique leaves some of the natural growth factors, which assists in maintaining good viability in the cultured slices. The cultured slices maintain good morphology (Figure 5).()Figure 5. An organotypic spinal cord slice growing in cultureB.  Addition of 5-ethynyl- calZ^ -deoxyuridine (EdU) to organotypic cultures1.  After 48h in culture, add 1~ul of EdU (1 m M) directly to the 1 ml of medium in each well. Add fresh EdU (0.5~u/) following any subsequent medium changes. EdU is a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA during active synthesis in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Figure 6) (Chehrehasa et al., 2009) providing a fast and reproducible method to employ for the study of cell proliferation (Figure 7).Note: This stage can be omitted if you do not wish to investigate cell proliferation.()Figure 6. EdU is incorporated into the newly synthesised DNA and visualised with addition of click chemistry and a fluorescent azideFigure 7. Timeline for culturing slices. Schematic of the timing for culturing slices and addition of EdU.()2.  After the allotted time in culture, fix the slices by removing the filter from the 6-well culture plate, with slices in situ and place on top of 1~ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer in a new 6-well culture plate. Carefully apply a further 500~ul of the 4% paraformaldehyde solution on top of the filter, covering the slices completely.3.  Leave slices in fixative for 6h at 4^°C .4.  Using a fine paint brush, carefully ease the slice free from the filter and place individually in 500 ul0.1 M phosphate buffered saline in a 24-well histology tray. Note: Slices can be stored at 4^°C in phosphate buffered saline for up to 7 days at this point.# C.  EdU detection in organotypic culturesSlices are kept in the 24-well histology tray throughout and this technique of free floating the slices is continued during the procedure. Each solution is removed from the well carefully at the end of allotted time using a pipette and the next solution carefully added by allowing it to run down the side of the well and not directly on top of the delicate slices. Unless otherwise stated, all steps are carried out at room temperature, with gentle agitation of the sections on a shaker plate.1.  Incubate in 500ul PBS with 0.2% Triton for 12m i n .2.  Wash 2×10 min in 500ul 0.1 M Tris buffer.3.  Incubate slices in a mix of 320~ul distilled water, 25~ul Tris buffer (2 M), 50ul copper sulphate :10m M) ), 5ul biotinylated azide (1 mM) and 100ul ascorbic acid (0.5M) in each well (make up fresh each time) for 30m i n .4.  Wash 2 x 10 min in 500 µl 0.1 M Tris buffer.5.  Wash 1x10 min in 500ul PBS.6.  Incubate in Streptavidin Alexa555 1:1,000 in 500~ul PBS with 0.1 % Triton for 1~h~ , protect from light by wrapping histology tray in tin foil for this and any subsequent steps.7.  Wash 3 x 10 min in 500ulP B S .8.  The sections can then be immunohistochemically labelled with appropriate antibodies following instructions of the supplier at this stage before mounting (Figure 8). Note: The slices are not agitated for longer than 2 h in the primary antibodies, as they start to disintegrate. If longer incubation time is required, leave in the histology tray without agitation at 4^°C .9.  Free float the slices in a Petri dish of distilled water and carefully float the slice onto a glass slideand guide into position with a fine paint brush.10. Protect from light and allow to air dry.11. Mount using VectaShield mounting media with or without DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).12.

BV2 microglial cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with spheroid conditioned media (CM) or were co-cultured with whole spheroids. Concentrations of secreted cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein arrays were used to further evaluate the effect of IL-1 priming in 2D and 3D cultures.\n\nMethodsCell culturesMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from 3H Biomedical (Sweden). Cells (harvested from a 22-week fetus) were differentiated into osteocytes or adipocytes using commercial kits (Millipore, UK) and characterised by the presence or absence of specific surface markers (CD73, CD90, CD105, CD34, CD11b, CD19, CD45, and HLA-DR), the minimal criteria for identifying MSCs [25].Culture flasks (Corning, UK) were coated with 0.1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 37 °C, and washed with PBS prior to cell seeding. Cells were expanded and cultured in MesenPRO RS® medium (Invitrogen, UK) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Medium was changed every 4–5 days until cultures reached 70–80% confluency. Cells were then detached using 0.5% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), counted, and split into different culture flasks, and further cultured as described above. Cells used for experiments were obtained from passage 5–6 and seeded at 13,000 cells/cm2 (for the 2D cultures),3D spheroid formationMSCs were harvested at passage 5–6 using 0.5% trypsin-EDTA, and sub-cultured in low-binding plates (Nunc International, Japan) using 50 μl MesenPRO RS®. The number of cells used in each spheroid (20,000 cells) was slightly higher than that used in 2D cultures, since not all cells formed spheroids. Spheroids were considered fully formed after 5 days in vitro [26]. Images of spheroids were taken with an inverted microscope (Olympus CK X31), using a Moticam 2300 camera coupled to Motic Images Plus 2.0 ML software at different time points to monitor spheroid formation. Spheroid size was estimated from the calculation of area and perimeter of the picture showing maximum sectional area (Fig. 1d). All clusters of cells with an area inferior to 0.15 mm2 were not considered spheroids and were therefore excluded in the measurements. The area was measured using ImageJ software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), and 25–30 spheroids for each treatment were included in the measurement (total n = 131 spheroids).Fig. 1Formation and measurements of spheroids. a Scheme of the formation of spheroids, with representative images at different times of growth. b Haematoxylin and eosin staining of a 20-μm section of a spheroid, in a bright field image. c Immunostaining of the same section using DAPI, indicating a compact cellular structure. d Spheroids were measured at different time points by measuring the maximum sectional area, indicated in the image as a dashed line. e Areas of main spheroids (mean + SEM) were larger at early time points and decreased with time, indicating the compaction of the spheroid. Scale bars = 500 μm in a, 200 μm in b–d. ****p < 0.001. P passageTo confirm their physical structure, spheroids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryopreserved with 30% glucose in phosphate buffer, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 1b) before being sectioned at 20 μm for DAPI staining (Fig. 1c).Microglial cells (BV2s)BV2 cells, an immortalised murine microglial cell line, were purchased from ATCC (UK) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, UK) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) until 70–80% confluent. Cells were detached with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), counted, and seeded at a density of 13,000 cells/cm2.Cell treatmentsPriming experiments in 2D versus 3DCells were treated (24 h after plating for 2D cultures or 5 days in vitro after plating for 3D cultures) with human recombinant IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, or interferon (IFN)-γ at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml (all from R&D Systems, UK). After 24 h, supernatants were collected and assayed for key human cytokines. As spheroid formation requires a small amount of media, cytokine concentrations from 2D and 3D cultures were normalised by the volume of supernatant collected from the wells at the end of the experiment (~50 μl in 3D, ~500 μl in 2D). The initial number of cells was also used as a normalisation factor. Three independent cultures were included, with at least three technical replicates per condition.Co-culture experiments: BV2 and 3D conditioned media (CM)MSC spheroids cultured for 5 days in vitro were treated for 2 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1α or IL-1β, and then washed twice with PBS and placed back in the low-binding plate with fresh media. Priming time was reduced to 2 h as shorter times were sufficient to induce changes in cytokine secretion (data not shown). Supernatants were collected 24 h later for further analysis of secreted cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).In parallel, 25,000 BV2 cells were seeded, cultured for 24 h, and then treated for 2 h with bacterial LPS (1 μg/ml, serotype E. coli 0127:B8, Sigma-Aldrich, UK). After LPS treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and the spheroid-CM was added to BV2 cells, diluted 1/10 in MesenPRO RS®. Supernatants were collected 24 h later and further analysed for the presence of mouse and human cytokines by ELISA. Final volumes in the wells were matched in each condition; therefore, no normalisation was carried out in this experiment. Three independent cultures were included, with at least three technical replicates per condition.Co-culture experiments: BV2 and whole 3D spheroidsMSCs and BV2 cells were seeded and treated as described; however, after the priming treatment with IL-1, MSC spheroids were washed twice with PBS and placed into a transwell insert (0.4-μm pore size; Greiner Bio One, UK) that had been previously equilibrated in RPMI media overnight. Inserts were placed on top of BV2 cells for 24 h, after which supernatants were collected and further analysed for the presence of mouse and human cytokines by ELISA. Another set of spheroids was primed (or left unprimed) as previously described and maintained in inserts in the absence of BV2 cells. Final volumes in the wells were matched in each condition; therefore, no normalisation was carried out in this experiment. Three independent cultures were included, with at least three technical replicates per condition.ELISAThe levels of VEGF, G-CSF, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA using mouse (m) or human (h) DuoSet® kits (R&D Systems, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IL-1Ra levels were measured using an ELISA kit from Peprotech (UK) combined with external standards prepared using recombinant human IL-1Ra (National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, NIBSC, UK). For each assay, protein levels were calculated against a four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve fit. Quantification limits were ~30 pg/ml for all the cytokines measured (except TNF-α, ~60 pg/ml), and no statistical analyses were carried out for values below this limit.Membrane arraysA human cytokine antibody array (Abcam, UK) was used to compare the secretion of cytokines secreted by MSCs in 2D and 3D, under primed and unprimed conditions. Supernatants from 2D and 3D were concentrated and diluted (respectively) up to four times, so that results from the arrays were directly comparable.A human MMP array was used to assess the differences in secretion of tissue remodelling proteins in 3D cultures. Supernatants from at least two independent experiments were pooled to reach 1 ml of supernatant required for the membrane array.For both arrays, densitometry data were obtained using ImageJ software, and normalised against the untreated values; therefore, the priming effect could be easily observable in 2D and 3D cultures. A PANTHER over-representation test [27] including all the analysed cytokines was performed against a human protein database to detect the main biological processes related to the overexpressed proteins.Statistical analysisCytokine concentrations are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data presentation and analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6.04 for Windows (California, USA). All differences were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data from 2D–3D comparisons were analysed after applying a linear logarithmic transformation. Holm Sidak post-hoc tests were performed if statistical significance was achieved (p < 0.05). Densitometry data were normalised versus the untreated conditions and differences were assessed by two-way ANOVA. Sidak’s multiple comparison tests were applied if statistical significance was achieved (p < 0.05).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5773162.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Knock-in Blunt Ligation Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9","text":"Knock-in Blunt Ligation Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Set up a minimum of 8 PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 ng of double-stranded DNA template and a minimum reaction volume of 50ul . Carry out the PCR on a thermocycler using appropriate parameters.2.  Following PCR, pool the reactions and purify the product using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 20ul of the provided EB buffer.3.  To remove carried-over plasmid, perform a restriction digest using FastDigest DpnI. Use a reaction volume of 30ul and the following thermocycler protocol: 37^°C for 1 h 80^°C for 10m i n 12^°C for infinity4.  Bring the reaction to 100~ul with nuclease-free water and purify the cassette product from the digest  using  a  CHROMASpin ^+ TE-1000  chromatography  column  according  to  the manufacturer’s instructions (see Note 1).B.  Knock-in blunt ligation1.  One day prior to transfection, plate 150,000 to 500,000 HEK293 cells per well in a 24-well plate in 500ul of growth media and place in a tissue culture incubator.2.  On the day of transfection, assemble the transfection reactions in microcentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood using 100-200 ng of purified cassette, 0.5-1.5~u9 of guide R N A+C a s9 vector, FuGENE® HD reagent at a 3:1 reagent-to-DNA ratio, and Opti-MEM I to 50ul . Perform each reaction in triplicate, making sure to include a negative (transfection reagent alone) control. Vortex the reactions briefly and incubate at room temperature for 30m i n .3.  After 30 min, aspirate media from cells and replace with 500ul of fresh growth media. Remove 50~ul of media from each well. Then, add the transfection reaction dropwise to each well, followed by gently swirling the plate to mix. Place the plate in a tissue culture incubator.4.  Two days post-transfection, trypsinize cells (see Note 2), harvest in microcentrifuge tubes, spin down at 300xg for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and aspirate the supernatant. Then, resuspend the  pellets  in 200~ul of FACS media supplemented with NucBlue® Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes® reagent and filter the cell suspension through the strainer of a Falcon test tube. Place tubes on ice, protected from light.5.  Using a FACSAria II flow cytometer, clone individual cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 200ul growth media. Briefly centrifuge (300× g) the plate after cloning and place in a tissue culture incubator for 5 days undisturbed (see Note 3). Note that this cloning process is greatly facilitated by a fluorescent reporter, either in the cassette or on the Cas9 expression vector (see Note 4).6.  After 5 days, replace old media with 200~ul of fresh media regularly until colonies are large enough to passage.7.  When passaging colonies for the first time, reserve half of the cells in each colony for diagnostic PCR to identify which colonies contain the desired knock-in event.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Generation of the Knock-in Blunt Ligation Cassette\n## PCR Setup and Execution\nSet up a minimum of 8 PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 ng of double-stranded DNA template and a minimum reaction volume of 50ul.\nCarry out the PCR on a thermocycler using appropriate parameters.\n## PCR Product Purification\nPool the reactions and purify the product using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nElute in 20ul of the provided EB buffer.\n## Restriction Digest\nPerform a restriction digest using FastDigest DpnI.\nUse a reaction volume of 30ul and the following thermocycler protocol: 37°C for 1 h, 80°C for 10m, and 12°C for infinity\n## Cassette Product Purification\nBring the reaction to 100ul with nuclease-free water.\nPurify the cassette product from the digest using a CHROMASpin+ TE-1000 chromatography column according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n## Knock-in Blunt Ligation\n## Cell Plating\nOne day prior to transfection, plate 150,000 to 500,000 HEK293 cells per well in a 24-well plate in 500ul of growth media.\nPlace the cells in a tissue culture incubator.\n## Transfection Reaction Assembly\nAssemble the transfection reactions in microcentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood using 100-200 ng of purified cassette, 0.5-1.5ug of guide RNA+Cas9 vector, FuGENE HD reagent at a 3:1 reagent-to-DNA ratio, and Opti-MEM to 50ul.\nPerform each reaction in triplicate, making sure to include a negative (transfection reagent alone) control.\nVortex the reactions briefly and incubate at room temperature for 30min.\n## Transfection\nAspirate media from cells and replace with 500ul of fresh growth media.\nRemove 50ul of media from each well and add the transfection reaction dropwise to each well.\nGently swirl the plate to mix and place the plate in a tissue culture incubator.\n## Cell Harvesting and Staining\nTwo days post-transfection, trypsinize cells and harvest in microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin down at 300xg for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in 200ul of FACS media supplemented with NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes reagent.\nFilter the cell suspension through the strainer of a Falcon test tube and place tubes on ice, protected from light.\n## Cell Cloning\nUsing a FACSAria II flow cytometer, clone individual cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 200ul growth media.\nBriefly centrifuge (300xg) the plate after cloning and place in a tissue culture incubator for 5 days undisturbed.\n## Colony Maintenance\nAfter 5 days, replace old media with 200ul of fresh media regularly until colonies are large enough to passage.\nWhen passaging colonies for the first time, reserve half of the cells in each colony for diagnostic PCR to identify which colonies contain the desired knock-in event.","keywords":" CRISPR/Cas9, Genome engineering, NHEJ, Double-strand breaks, Cell culture Background At the time we conceptualized knock-in blunt ligation (Geisinger et al., 2016), the vast majority of methods developed for use with CRISPR/Cas9 were focused on enhancing the efficiency of homologous recombination. However, there was one exception: a homology-independent, plasmidbased knock-in method developed in zebrafish (Auer et al., 2014). This method, like knock-in blunt ligation, relies on the machinery of canonical non-homologous end-joining to insert a linearized, bluntended, double-stranded DNA fragment into a genomic double-strand break with a high degree of precision and minimal loss of nucleotides. Both methods are similar to a method developed for zincfinger nucleases and TALENs known as obligate ligation-gated recombination (ObLiGaRe; Maresca et al., 2013), which relied on the generation of compatible overhangs to facilitate insertion of target DNA into the genome. Both the Auer method and ObLiGaRe rely on delivery of a vector bearing the desired transgene construct, which could lead to incorporation of undesirable exogenous sequences. Because of the propensity of Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 to make blunt-ended double-strand breaks, we reasoned that exogenous sequence delivery in genome engineering experiments could be limited to solely the CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector and a PCR-generated amplicon of solely the sequence of interest. Thus, knock-in blunt cloning possesses the dual advantages of minimizing the introduction of exogenous sequences and its reliance on canonical non-homologous end-joining rather than homologous recombination. While the following protocol is specifically for human HEK293 cells, we note that this method is likely to be broadly applicable to eukaryotic cells.","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2163"}}

All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma.Cloning of the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAcDNAs (Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN were synthesized from the GenScript company (the N gene is replaced with gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP)). PCR was conducted to amplify fragments A, B, C, D and E using high fidelity PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara). T7 promoter was introduced upstream of 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genome in fragment A. To guarantee a seamless assembly of the full-length cDNA, type IIS restriction endonuclease sites (BsaI or BsmBI) were introduced at both ends of PCR fragments. The primers used for the PCR assay were listed in S1 Table.Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAPCR fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) to get specific sticky end. Digested fragments are purified by E.Z.N.A gel extraction kit (Omega). Fragment A, B are ligated first by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in 40μl system. At the same time, fragments C, D, E are also ligated in another tube at 4°C for 24 hours. Then, fragment A, B and C, D, E are combined together added with 2μl T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2μl T4 DNA ligase to 100μl at 4°C for another 24 hours. At the end of ligation, we took 5μl product to run an agarose gel to check the efficiency of ligation. Full-length assembly cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, isopropanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10μL nuclease-free water. Requests for resources and reagents relevant with this study should be directed to corresponding author Dr. Qiang Ding (qding@tsinghua.edu.cn).RNA in vitro transcription, electroporation and virus productionRNA transcript was in vitro transcribed by the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 30μl system with some modifications. Twenty micrograms of viral RNA and 20μg N mRNA were mixed and added to a 4-mm cuvette containing 0.4 mL of Caco-2-N cells (8×106) in Opti-MEM. Single electrical pulse was given with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with setting of 270V at 950μF. GFP signal can be observed 17 hours post electroporation. Three days post electroporation, P0 virus was collected and Caco-2-N cells were infected with P0 virus to amplify virus.Lentivirus packagingVesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced by transient cotransfection of the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog number 12260; Addgene) and the transfer vector pLVX by VigoFect DNA transfection reagent (Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection. Supernatants were collected at 36, 60 and 84 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C refrigerator.RNA isolation and RT-qPCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo, 15596018). To analyze the RNA level of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. In brief, 1μg total RNA was reverse transcribed using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-101) to produce cDNA with random primers. Reactions of qPCR were carried out using the 2×RealStar Green Power Mixture (Genstar, A311) according to the instruction. The qPCR primers for viral RNA were as follows: THU-2190 (5’- CGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCC-3’) and THU-2191 (5’- TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3’). The sequences of the qPCR primers for GAPDH was described previously[44]. Relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. All data were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.RNA-seq and data analysisTotal RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The rRNAs were removed by using Ribo-Zero Gold module of Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA library prep kit (RS-122-2201) and then cDNA libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq was performed by using the Illumina Novaseq platform. The reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947) was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore /MN908947. After removing low-quality reads, remaining Illumina sequence reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) and SARS2 genome by using HISAT2.1.0 with parameters:—rna-strandness RF–dta. RNA-seq coverage was visualized by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). To quantify the expression levels of SARS2 genes, RPKM of each virus genes and GFP gene were calculated. Heatmaps were drawn by using R package “pheatmap” (https://www.r-project.org). To quantify the junction-reads from subgenomic RNAs, the STAR2.7.5c was used for reads mapping. The junction-reads was defined and collected as described[45]. A Sankey diagram was drawn by using R packages named “networkD3” and “dplyr”.IFN-β, neutralizing antibody and drug treatmentTo assess the antiviral efficacies of the materials, 1×104 Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 GFPΔN virus at MOI of 0.05. For neutralizing antibody treatment, virus was incubated with neutralizing antibody for 1 hour at 37°C before infection. For IFN-β (Sino Bioligical, 10704-HNAS-5) test, cells were pre-treated with IFN-β for 8 hours before infection. For remdesivir (MedChemExpress, HY-104077), lopinavir (biochempartner, BCP01395) or ritonavir (biochempartner, BCP03777) treatment, drugs were added simultaneously upon infection. Two days after infection, flow cytometry was performed to analyze GFP positive rate. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50; compound concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% reduction of GFP positive cells) were determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Cell viability assayCaco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plate (1×103 cells/well). After 12 hours, cells were treated with drugs with different concentrations. Cell viability was measured two days post treatment with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7570) following standard protocol. In brief, cells in 100 μl culture medium were added with 100 μl CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 15 minutes, luminescence was recorded with GloMax (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Flow cytometry analysisCells were detached in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA and then washed once with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRFortessa SORP (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.Western blottingSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting was conducted as follows: After trypsinization and cell pelleting at 1500 r/m for 10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked at room temperature for 0.5 h using 5% nonfat milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-N (05–0154, AbMax), S (40589-T62, Sino Biological), β-Tubulin (CW0098, CWBIO), Flag (F7425, Sigma), ACE2 (10108-T24, Sino Biological) in 5% nonfat milk in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were then washed in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After 1h exposure to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent washes were performed as described for the primary antibodies. Membranes were visualized using the Luminescent image analyzer (GE).Antiviral screeningTwelve hours prior to infection for the antiviral screening 5 × 104 Caco-2-Nint cells were seeded in 96 well plates. The next day, a single dilution of each compound of the Topscience Natural Product Library at 5 μM final concentration was added to the cells (50 μL/well). DMSO or remdesivir (3.5μM) were included in each plate as the internal control. After 2 hours, 50 μL of virus was added to the wells at MOI 0.05. Two days after infection, cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis to determine the GFP expression.Evaluation of antiviral activity using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virusA549 cells stably expressing human ACE2 were seeded in a 96-well plate (4×104 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with drugs (Lycorine chloride (TargetMol, T2774), Tubeimoside I (TargetMol, T2715), Nigericin sodium (TargetMol, T3092), Monensin sodium (MedChemExpress, HY-N0150), Salinomycin (MedChemExpress, HY-15597)) of different concentration for 2 hours prior to infection. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS culture medium for 24 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1 μg/ml) at 4°C overnight. After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo #A32732, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by staining with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an Operetta High Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). For high content imaging, two biological replicates for each concentration of drug were scanned and five representative fields were selected for each well of 96-well plates. Image analysis was performed using the PerkinElmer Harmony high-content analysis software 4.9. Cells were automatically identified by DAPI (nuclei). Mean fluorescent intensity of channel Alexa 555 (viral nucleocapsid) of each cell were subsequently calculated, respectively. For the 0% inhibition control, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in N protein expression. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the dose-response (variable slope) equation (four parameter logistic equation).SARS-CoV-2 infection and biosafetyThe SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-SH01 (GenBank accession no. MT121215) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and propagated in Vero E6 cells for use. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of Tsinghua University has approved the SARS-CoV-2 trVLP cell culture system use in BSL-2 if the Caco-2-Nint cells were used for infection by SARS-CoV-2 trVLP within 8 passages. All other experiments in this study involving authentic virus or SARS-CoV-2 trVLP infections were performed in the biosafety level 3 facility of Fudan University following all regulations.Statistical analysisStudent’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used to test for statistical significance of the differences between the different group parameters. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7990224.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Ultra-low Background DNA Cloning System","text":"Ultra-low Background DNA Cloning System\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

Preparation of conversion cassette SU32a.  Prepare the conversion cassette SU32 by PCR using a plasmid pSU32 as template. To obtain this template, visit the following webpage. http://www.iac.saga-u.ac.jp/lifescience/su32/index.htmb.  For PCR amplification, the primer pair was pSU30-14 and pSU30-23 (40 cycles of 98~^°C for 10 sec, 55~^°C for 15 sec, and 68~^°C for 75 sec using Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase) (Goto and Nagano, 2013). When we conduct the PCR reaction, we use Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase, but you can use the other proofreading DNA polymerases. Note: Although we purified the amplified conversion cassette in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential (purification is required for DNA quantification).c.  Confirm the amplification by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicon size is about 2.7 kb (2,651 bp) (Figure 3).()Conversion cassette SU32# Figure 3. Conversion cassette SU322.  Preparation of the linearized E. coli plasmid vector a.  Digest the E. coli plasmid vector within the crossover region by using restriction enzyme.Notes:i.   The required restriction ends can be located anywhere within the crossover regions of the vector. You can use both blunt-end restriction enzyme and sticky-end restriction enzyme, because restriction ends are not positions where joining reactions occur.ii. This E. coli plasmid vector must contain the Ampr gene.iii.  PCR amplification of the E. coli plasmid vector is another way to prepare the linearized E. coli plasmid vector.iv.

Preparation of the DNA fragment to be cloned.a.  Amplify a DNA fragment of interest by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerase suchas Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase.# Notes:i. PCR primers should be designed to carry the sequences with more than 20 bp of homology to the crossover region. We often use the sequences with 30-40 bp of homology to the crossover region. For the highest efficiency, we recommend you to use PCR primers purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the PAGE purification is not essential.ii.  Although we purified the DNA fragment of interest in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis.# 4.  Transformation of DNA fragments into yeast.# Notes:i.   In our laboratory, we perform the transformation procedure at half or quarter scale of this method. ii.   The molar ratio of the 3 DNA fragments was 1:1:1. However, this ratio is not important (Goto and Nagano, 2013). (Ten-fold variation of the ratio probably does not affect the efficiency.) Required amount of the conversion cassette SU32 is < 50n g. . b.  Select the transformants by incubating yeast cells on synthetic complete plates lacking tryptophan at 30~^°C for 2 or 3 days.# 5.  Purification of plasmid from yeast.Note: To purify plasmid DNAs from yeast, we use a Mini-M Plasmid DNA ExtractionSystem, but you can use the other Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit for E. coli.a.  Scrape all colonies from the plates with plating beads, and collect yeast cells by the centrifuge. Using the microfuge, centrifuge cells at 14,000× g for 5 sec (we often use the picofuge at a maximum speed for 30 sec). Remove the supernatant.b.  Add the suspension buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 200~ul of MX1 buffer), and suspend the yeast cells by vortexing.c.  Scoop equal amounts of acid-washed glass beads (350-500~um) to the suspended solution using 1.5~m~ tube, add glass beads into tube containing the suspended solution, and then disrupt yeast cells by shaking 3 times for 20 sec at speed 5.5 using the FastPrep FP100A. Alternatively, vortex 5 times for 1 min at maximum speed. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()d.

Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()()f.   Attach another tube to the bottom of the tube, and centrifuge them to recover the denatured solution in the bottom tube. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()g.  For subsequent procedures, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. However, use elution solution preheated to 70~^°C . Because DNA concentration of the eluted solution is low, you cannot determine the concentration of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometer. However, the DNA concentration of the eluted solution is sufficient for next procedures. Therefore, the condensation of the eluted solution is not required.6.  Pretreatment of the eluted solution (Optional)a.  For the highest efficiency, digest 5~ul of the recovered plasmids (the eluted solution) with small amounts (in.g. 0.2 lHl) ) of an appropriate restriction enzyme by directly adding the enzyme to the eluted DNA solution. Note: Because the principle of this method is complicated, read our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013) carefully. Do not add an enzyme reaction buffer, because the salt may affect the next electroporation step.b.  Incubate the tube at an appropriate temperature for more than 1 h.7.

Stocks of yeast strains were kept in −80°C in 50% glycerol.Preparation of control modern vessels for yeast isolation.A modern clay vessel was broken into equally sized and shaped pieces and divided into two groups: group A pieces were buried “as is,” in three pits that were 30 cm deep and with a 2-m space between them in a city garden. Group B shards were buried in the same way in a different city garden, situated several hundred meters away. Prior to covering them up, the pieces of group B were sprayed with 300 ml of unpasteurized lager beer with a vital colony of the branded strain Fermentis-WB-34/70. After 6 weeks, the pottery from both sites was retrieved and sent to the lab for yeast cell revival and isolation.Yeast isolation from vessels and control samples.The vessels were entirely flooded with rich YPD medium (Difco, USA) and incubated at room temperature for 7 days. Then, samples from the medium were streaked on selective agar plates for fungal isolation (NOVAmed BA-114, Israel) and incubated at 30°C for 12 to 48 h. Yeast colonies growing on the plates were replated on solid YPD agar plates, containing 2% wt/vol Bacto agar (Difco, USA). Colonies were picked for further analysis.Electron microscopy.Ceramic samples were cut using a diamond disc power cutter (Dremel). The surface morphology of the archaeological ceramic samples was examined using the FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope situated in the core facility of the Hebrew University Medical School in Ein Kerem. Samples were first sputtered by Au/Pd (SC7620; Quorum Technologies). Images were then taken with a secondary electron detector at magnification ×10,000 to ×40,000 using a 10- to 30-kV accelerating voltage and a lens objective aperture of 30 to 20 μm.DNA purification.Yeast cell DNA isolation was performed as previously described (84). Briefly, 10 ml of overnight cultures was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and washed in sterile water. The cells were treated with 200 μl of phenol chloroform, 0.3 g of acid-washed glass beads, and 200 μl of Smash and Grab solution (84) and lysed using a vortex for 3 min, after which TE buffer was added. The cells were centrifuged, and the aqueous layer containing the DNA was transferred to 1 ml ethanol and then washed and suspended in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. One microliter of RNase (10 mg/ml DNase- and protease-free RNase; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and the solution was incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Ten microliters of ammonium acetate (4 M) and 1 ml of ethanol were then added, and the solution was washed, and suspended in 100 μl of TE buffer. The extracted DNA was stored at −20°C. DNA quantification was carried out on a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., VT), using a Take3 microvolume plate.ITS analysis.The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the yeast was amplified using standard Illumina primers as described at the Earth Microbiome Project website (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/its/). PCR fragments were Sanger sequenced by the interdepartmental sequencing unit of the Hebrew University. The sequences were identified by BLAST analysis against the ISHAM barcoding database (http://its.mycologylab.org) and the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).DNA sequencing.Sequencing was performed in the interdepartmental unit at the Hebrew University, Hadassah Ein Karem Campus. Libraries were prepared by using a Nextera XT DNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and DNA was amplified by a limited-cycle PCR and purified using AMPure XP beads. The DNA libraries were normalized, pooled, and tagged in a common flow cell at 2 × 250 base-paired-end reads using the NextSeq platform.Genome assembly.Illumina adaptors were removed with Trimmomatic 0.36 (85). The quality of the reads was determined using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). De novo assembly was then carried out with the Celera assembler 8.3rc2 (86), and non-target-species scaffolds were excluded using BlobTools V1 (87). The sequencing and genome assembly effort was targeted at obtaining assemblies contiguous enough to derive protein coding gene data for phylogenomic analyses (Table S5). The resulting genome assemblies had coverages of 36× to 240× and N50 values of 2,842 to 15,623 bp (Table S5). These data provided us with at least 2,702 protein coding genes per sample with a median length of at least 294 amino acids (aa). The gene count variation could be the result of ploidy differences or of genome assembly artifacts and may cause the underestimation of one-to-one orthologs. However, we were still able to curate a large and high-quality one-to-one ortholog gene subset to perform the phylogenomic analyses.10.1128/mBio.00388-19.7TABLE S5Genome assembly statistics.

Water (5 liters) was heated to a pasteurization temperature of 72°C. Malt extract was added to a final concentration of 100 g/liter, while thoroughly stirring, and allowed to infuse together for 30 min in temperatures between 63 and 67°C. The solution was then heated to 100°C, and once boiling had occurred, 1 g/liter of hops was added. The mixture was allowed to boil for 45 more minutes, followed by the addition of another 1 g/liter of hops. The mixture was then heated for an additional minute. Previously prepared ice-cold water was then added to the mixture, and the prepared wort was transferred to a sanitized fermentor and brought to a final volume of 10 liters. The wort was left at room temperature for 30 min before being divided into fermentation vessels and then overnight cultures of yeast were added. Fermentation typically began within 12 to 48 h, and the mixture was left untouched for a week.HS-SPME procedure and GC-MS analysis of beer.The method we used was based on the method described by Rodriguez et al. (66). Beer bottles were cooled at 4°C to prevent loss of volatiles. The beer sample (6 ml), a magnetic stirrer, 100 μl of an internal standard (5 ppm 2-octanol) and 1.8 g of NaCl were added to 20-ml SPME headspace vials and were sealed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-silicon septum (Supelco). The samples were then incubated for 10 min at 44.8°C in a water bath on a heating plate and stirred by magnetic stirrer. The septum covering the vial headspace was pierced with the needle containing the SPME fiber and retracted, and the fiber was subsequently exposed to the headspace for 47 min at 44°C and then inserted directly into the GC-MS injection port. SPME fiber, consisting of 50/30-μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) with a length of 2 cm, and the manual holder were purchased from Supelco (Sigma-Aldrich). The analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) fitted with splitless injection with a liner suitable for SPME analysis and an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer (MS) detector in full-scan mode. Agilent MSD ChemStation software was used to control the gas chromatograph (G1701-90057). Ultrahigh-purity-grade helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were analyzed on a DB-5MS UI column (30 m by 0.250-mm inside diameter by 0.25-μm film thickness) from Agilent. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 40°C as initial temperature, held for 5 min, followed by a ramp of temperature at 4°C/min to 60°C and then at 8°C/min to 200°C, then held for 15 min, holding at this temperature for 5 min. An electron impact ionization technique was used at 70 eV. The detector range of the scan was from m/z 10 to 250. Suggestions for the identification of the detected peaks were carried out by the Wiley mass spectrometry database. Peak areas were calculated using the integration order in the ChemStation software. For each sample, we determined the peak area for 2-octanol standard and ethanol, as well as for 35 aroma compounds usually found in beer. Following the integration of the 2-octanol peaks, we were not satisfied with its repeatability between technical repeats. Thus, we decided to use the peak areas of ethanol, which was separated clearly and was highly correlated to its determination by distillation in our lab, as an internal standard for each sample. To achieve normalized ethanol peak areas, we divided the peak area of ethanol by its concentration (percentage) determined by distillation, for each beer sample. Finally, the relative peak area for each compound was calculated by dividing the peak area of the compound to that of the normalized ethanol peak area, and multiplied by 1,000, to get more presentable numbers. This allows us a presentation of qualitative analysis of relative peak areas for each compound across our samples. The results presented and the statistical analysis were done by averaging the three biological samples for each yeast strain.Determination of carbohydrates in beers.Stock solutions of phenol (J&K Scientific Gmbh) at 0.05 g/ml and d(+)-glucose (Merck) at 100 μg/ml were prepared. Glucose standards in aliquots of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, and 20 ml of the glucose stock solution were pipetted and transferred into nine 30-ml beakers. An adequate amount of distilled water was added to make a final volume of 20 ml. Each solution (2 ml) was measured and transferred into 10 test tubes. The phenol (2 ml) and 10 ml of the concentrated 95 to 97% sulfuric acid (Merck) were pipetted and added to each of the 10 test tubes. A light orange color developed, and the tube was allowed to stand for 10 min. The solutions were then transferred into 1-cm path-length cuvettes, and the absorbances were measured at 485 nm with a UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV Vis, Thermo). For measurements, 1 ml of beer was measured and transferred into a 1-liter volumetric flask. Distilled water was added to make a 1,000-ml solution. Aliquots (2 ml) were transferred into test tubes and mixed with 2 ml phenol solution and 10 ml concentrated sulfuric acid. A light orange color developed, and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm after 10 min. Results were determined by averaging triplicate measurements. The ethanol concentration in beer samples was determined using a Super Dee digital distillator and a Super Alcomat electronic hydrostatic balance (Gibertini, Italy). pH values of beer samples were measured using a Hanna HI 2211 pH meter (Hanna Instruments).To analyze their spectrophotometric properties, the beer samples were degassed and centrifuged followed by a spectrophotometric (Genesys 10S UV Vis; Thermo Scientific) measurement at 430 nm (10-mm quartz cuvettes). Beer color was calculated by two scales: SRM and EBC, where SRM = absorbance × 12.7 and EBC = absorbance × 25.0. To determine the beers’ density, we used a hydrometer (“Alla” Franc).Beer tasting.The flavor and aroma assessments were performed according to the BJCP’s judge procedure manual (https://www.bjcp.org/judgeprocman.php) as follows. A 100-ml sample was served to the assessors in identical vessels to prevent variations of aroma and flavor compound distribution. The assessors then recorded their impressions discreetly on a recognized form to avoid bias between the tasters. The forms, interdivided according to the subject’s appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall impression, were then collected, summarized, and processed. The summary ignored the appearance and overall impression sections, as well as hop flavor and aroma entries, and focused primarily on known fermentation by-products and sugar residue compounds. All “named entries” on the forms (such as caramel/fruity/etc.) come with a notation of the strength of the flavor/aroma derives from on a scale of 1 to 5 (left column on the evaluation form) and averaged by 5 testers.Statistical analysis.Statistical analysis was performed using R (https://www.r-project.org) and Prism Graphpad 7 (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). Differences between growth curves in wort medium (Fig. 3) were calculated using R “growthcurver” package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/growthcurver/vignettes/Growthcurver-vignette.html) by fitting the growth data to the logistic equation. The r parameters of each curve were compared either to that of SafAle S.04, a modern beer yeast that served as a control, or to each other using principal-component analysis (PCA) with the R prcomp() command. For significance distances from the control growth curve, we used the Student's t test. Differences between aromatic and flavor compounds in beer produced by the isolated yeast strains (Fig. 4) and the aromas and flavors of these beer were compared by clustering analysis using R function hclust()with the method “complete” and the dist() function with the method “euclidean.” The dendrograms and clusters were created using Ward hierarchical clustering with bootstrapped P values using the R pvclust() method from R package pvclust, with parameters hclust=\"ward.D2” and method.dist=\"Euclidean.”Data availability.Raw reads are available in GenBank under accession no.

After removing the supernatant, cell pellets can be frozen at -80~^°C .Note: It is preferred to wash cell pellet with  I xP B S, but this step is not required because the small amount of medium in the cell pellet does not interfere with subsequent steps.2.  Cell lysis: Re-suspend the cells that are fresh or just thawed on ice from -80~^°C with 200 μl 1x PBS and add 20ul proteinase K (20m g/m l) .3.  DNA extraction: Use DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit to get high DNA yield. Quantify DNA samples by Nanodrop. Note: Multiple methods are available to extract DNA from cells. We prefer the commercial kit since it can easily be performed to get high yield DNA.4.  DNA digestion: Digest 2.5~u DNA for 4h to overnight at 37~^°C with combination of restriction enzymes (HhaI, HinF1, MspI, HaeIII, RsaI, AluI). Prepare 2.5ug DNA in d H_2O to make 40ul total volume. Add 10~ul enzyme digestion mix to DNA sample (40~ul) , so total volume is 50~ul . Incubate in a water bath or heating block overnight at 37^°C .1 sample HhaI 0.25 μl HinF1 0.5 μl MspI 0.25 μl HaeIII 0.5 μl RsaI 0.5 μl AluI 0.5 μl NE buffer 2 5.0 μl H2O 2.5 μl Total: 10 μl5.  Gel migration: Load radiolabeled TRF ladder and unlabeled molecular weight marker on either or both sides of the samples. Separate digested DNA on 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel stained with gel red (1/20,000x) for 18h at 70 volts for a 25cm long gel in 1x TAE or 0.5× TBE buffer. 18h after samples run, check the gel under a UV source (e.g., at G-BOX) to make sure genomic DNA is completely digested and runs as a smear below the 800 bp molecular weight marker (Figure 1A). Anything above 800 bp shows incomplete genomic DNA digestion and this could interfere with the telomere signal (Figure 1B).()Figure 1. Gel with DNA ladder marker. A. DNA samples run as a smear below 800 bp (yellow dashline), showing complete digestion of genomic DNA. B. DNA samples are above 800 bp (yellow dashline), showing incomplete genomic digestion. bp: base pair# Notes:a.  Add 5 μl loading dye to the samples. While 0.5x TBE can be used to analyze less than ~8 kb, 1x TAE buffer can be used for the ones that have longer telomeres (8 to 20 kb range) to have better separation.b.  400 ml volume is good enough for 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel in large gel system.c.  Radiolabeled TRF marker can be visualized after hybridization with telomere sequence-specific probe. The unlabeled, digested plasmid DNA can be visualized with Gel Red, not with the telomere sequence specific probe.d.  To prevent leaking of the gel from the gel tray: Wait 20 min after agarose is dissolved in microwave. During this time, seal the space between the gel tray and gaskets (edges of gel tray) with 5-10 ml agarose gel (Figure 2A). Wait 30 min following the pour of the gel (do not forget the put comb when you pour the gel).e.  Higher concentration of agarose in buffer will cause poor separation of samples and TRF marker (Figure 2B) and also processing gel drying will take a much more time than lower concentration of agarose.()Figure 2. Preparation of agarose gel electrophoresis. A. This figure shows how to seal between the gaskets and gel tray with agarose gel to prevent leaking. B. The separation difference between 0.7% and 1.4% agarose gel. While 0.7% agarose gel shows good separation on the TRF ladder, TRF ladder on 1.4% agarose gel is not separated well. 25~ul and 12.5~ul ladder was loaded in each lane of 0.7% and 1.4% gels, respectively. TRF ladder 1 and 2 in 1.4% gel are the same ladders. TRF ladder units are kilobase (kb).# 6.  DNA Hybridization:a.  Denature the gel for 20 min in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH solution (p H13.2) in a Pyrex® container (slowly shake). Make sure that denaturing solution covers the gel during shaking.b.  Rinse gel with MilliQ® water to remove NaOH.c.  Put the gel upside down on 2 sheets of 3MM Whatman® paper and wrap on the top of the gel (Figure 3A and B).d.  Dry the gel using a gel dryer 56^°C for 3~h~ ).e.  Transfer the gel to a Pyrex® container, rinse with MilliQ® water and remove the Whatman® paper.f.    Neutralize the gel for 30m i n with 0.5 M Tris-HCl and 1.5 M NaCl solution (pH 8). Make sure that neutralization solution covers the gel during shaking.g.  Wrap gel around _25ml pipette and transfer gel to a cylindrical hybridization tube. Note: Make sure that caps are sealed well and don’t leak.h.  Prehybridize the gel with 10ml hybridization solution for at least 10 min at 42^°C in hybridization oven.i. Add 12.5ul hot probe (see step 7 at below) to a fresh 10m hybridization solution and let it hybridize overnight at 42^°C rotating hybridization oven. Notes: i.  Be careful when you are working with radioactive material. Protect yourself with a shield and try to avoid any contamination to the work area. ii.

Note: Prepare the washing solutions in the following order: SSC, water, SDS so they dissolve easily.9.  Exposure: Prepare the gel for scanning. Briefly, wrap the gel with plastic (Saran type) wrap in the cassette and put the screen on the gel (Figure 4). Expose it at least 4 h, preferably overnight. Scan the screen on Typhoon PhosphorImager.()Figure 4. Illustrates the preparation of the gel for scanning step by step. Prepare the saran plastic wrap in an appropriate cassette size and spread it into the cassette. Then, put gel onto this plastic wrap and cover the gel by wrapping with additional plastic wrap. Place screen on top of the gel that is surrounded plastic wrap, then incubate it in a dark place. All steps should be done behind a protective shield.10.

Nipponbare [60], NF9876, kindly provided by the Rice Genome Resource Center, Japan. The mel1-1 mutant [7], another Tos17 line with the Nipponbare background, was kindly provided by the National Bioresource Project (NBRP) Rice, conducted by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The tip2-2 mutant is a T-DNA tag line with the genetic background of cv. Dongjin [61, 62], 1B-24309, kindly provided by Dr. G. An (POSTECH, Korea). All plants were grown in moist chambers, greenhouses, and/or open paddy fields at the National Institute of Genetics (NIG), Mishima, Japan. Plant genotypes were determined by PCR using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) and gene-specific and T-DNA/Tos17-internal primers (S6 Table).HistologyRice spikelets were fixed in PMEG buffer (50 mM PIPES, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4, and 4% glycerol, pH 6.8) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 h and washed six times in PMEG buffer for 2 hours. After dehydration using ethanol series, they were embedded in Technovit7100 resin (Heraeus Kulzer), sectioned in 2 μm thick slices using a LM2255 microtome (Leica Microsystems), stained with 0.1% toluidine blue O (Wako Pure Chemicals) and photographed using a BX50 light microscope (Olympus) and a DP50 camera system (Olympus). Cellulosic cell wall staining was conducted according to the method described previously [63]. Fluorescent images were captured using a Fluoview FV300 CLSM system (Olympus), and pseudo-colored and merged using Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems Inc.).Construction and transformation of fluorescent-tagged proteinsEAT1pro-EAT1-GFP (Fig 1D) was constructed as follows. The 5.3 kbp HindIII-XhoI genomic fragment including the upper half of the EAT1 gene and its promoter region was subcloned from a BAC clone, OSJNBa0010K21, into the pBluescriptII (pBSII)-SK(-) vector. The 1.2 kbp XhoI-EcoRV fragment including the 3’ downstrem region of the EAT1 gene was also subcloned into another pBSII-SK(-), and from this plasmid, the 2.0 kbp XhoI-EcoRV fragment harboring a sGFP sequence just in the front of the EAT1 stop codon was constructed using EAT1-specific primers, bHLH141stop-BamHI/bHLH141XhoI-BamHI and bHLH141stop-NotI/M13-Rev, and a CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-nos3ʹ vector [64], kindly provided by Dr. Y. Niwa (Shizuoka U., Japan). The resultant 5.3 kbp and 2.0 kbp fragments were inserted into a pPZP2H-lac binary vector [65] to assemble EAT1pro-EAT1-GFP.TIP2pro-YFP-TIP2 (S8A Fig) was constructed as follows. The 6.6 kbp genomic fragment, including the entire TIP2 gene with 4 kbp upstream and 0.5 kbp downstream sequences, was cut out from a rice BAC clone OSJNBa0001E17 by digestion with SpeI, and inserted into pBSII-SK(-) vector. From the 6.6 kbp fragment, the 1.8 kbp HindIII-SalI fragment including the translational initiation site (TIS) was subcloned into pBSII-SK(-). From this plasmid, the YFP sequence was inserted just in front of TIS by using TIP2-specific primers bHLH142start-NcoI/M13-Rev and bHLH142start-BsrGI/T7-EcoRI and a pEYFP vector (a cloning vector with EYFP sequence in pUC18 backbone). Then, the 1.8 kbp fragment with the YFP sequence was inserted back into the original 6.6 kbp genomic fragment/pBSII-SK(-) plasmid. The resultant 7.4-kbp insert was digested, blunt-ended, and reinserted into pGWB601 binary vector [66], kindly provided by Dr. T. Nakagawa (Shimane U., Japan). In case of TIP2pro-TIP2-YFP (S8D Fig), the TIP2 stop codon in the above 6.6 kbp genomic fragment/pBSII-SK(-) was replaced by YFP sequence by using TIP2-specific primers, bHLH142stop-NcoI/M13-20 and bHLH142stop-BsrGI/M13-Rev, and a pEYFP. Finally, the 7.4 kbp of TIP2pro-TIP2-YFP insert was assembled in the pPZP2H-lac. In above constructions, KOD-FX DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) was used for PCR.In MEL1pro-GFP-MEL1 construction, the GFP sequence was inserted just in front of MEL1 TIS in pKN16, a binary vector containing the 18 kbp MEL1 genomic fragment [7]. Two DNA fragments, corresponding to 5ʹ upstream and 3ʹ downstream regions of MEL1 TIS, were amplified from pKN16 with primer pairs up_nf/up_nr and up_atgf/up_r, respectively. Linker-attached sGFP coding sequence was amplified from CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-nos3ʹ with ngfp_f/ngfp_r primers. The PCRs were conducted using a PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The three amplified DNA fragments were mixed with the NruI-AscI-digested pKN16 and incubated with an In-Fusion HD enzyme premix (TaKaRa) to assemble MEL1pro-GFP-MEL1, following manufacturer’s instructions. All the primer sequences for the construction were listed in S6 Table.The constructs were transformed into rice calli using agrobacterium-mediated transformation [67], in which Hygromycin B (50 mg/L in media; Wako Pure Chemicals) or glufosinate-ammonium PESTANAL (5 mg/L in media; Sigma-Aldrich) was used for a positive selection.Observation of GFP and YFP signals in rice anthersAnthers embedded in 6% SeaKem GTG agarose (Lonza) were sliced into 50 μm thickness by MicroSlicer DTK-ZERO1 (D.S.K.), and mounted on slide grasses with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI. Fluorescent images were captured using Fluoview FV300 CLSM system (Olympus).Meiotic chromosome observationSpikelet (lemma) and anther lengths were measured under SMZ645 stereo microscopy (Nikon). 0.8–1.2 mm anthers were fixed with 4% PFA/PMEG and provided for chromosome observations as previously described [7]. Fluorescent images of DAPI were taken as described above.RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Anther or spikelet samples were separated by their lengths as corresponding to ST.1-ST.6 stages (S7 Table), immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen in microtubes, and stored at -80°C until use. Total RNAs were extracted from the samples using TRIzol reagent as manufacturer’s recommendation (Life Technologies), and treated with DNase I (TaKaRa). In qRT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by oligo(dT)12-18 primer (Life Technologies) and SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The products were 20-fold diluted and supplied for real-time qPCR using gene-specific primers (S6 Table), KAPA SYBR FAST universal qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems) and Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TaKaRa). Rice Ubiquitine gene was used as an internal standard.mRNA-seq, sRNA-seq and data analysesTotal RNAs were extracted from ST.1, ST.2 and ST.4 anthers of wild-type and eat1-4 plants, three biological replicates each. For mRNA-seq, 1 μg of total RNA was subjected to library construction using KAPA stranded mRNA-seq Kit Illumina Platforms (KAPA biosystems). Eighteen libraries differentially indexed by FastGene Adapter kit (Nippon Genetics) were multiplexed (9 per lane) and sequenced by HiSeq2500 (Illumina) with SR50 (single ended). Adapter sequences were removed in silico using R package QuasR [68].mRNA-seq reads were mapped on the rice genome IRGSP1.0 using Tophat (v2.0.14) [69]. Differential expression analysis of annotated genes were conducted using Cuffdiff2 program [70]. The genes fulfilling all of the following conditions were regarded as EAT1-dependent and ST.2-enriched genes; (1) genes showing >2-fold higher FPKM values in wild-type ST.2 anthers than the values in wild-type ST.1 and ST.4 anthers, (2) genes showing >2-fold higher FPKM values in wild-type ST.2 anthers than the values in eat1-4 ST.2 anthers, and (3) genes with each standard deviation less than a half of the FPKM mean value of three replicates in wild-type ST.2 anthers. The lincRNAs were determined by Cuffdiff2 (merged.gtf), in which protein-coding genes were removed as referring to MSU7.0 annotation, and unannotated but transcribed genomic regions larger than 200 bp were extracted. FPKM values of lincRNAs were calculated by BEDtools [71]. Furthermore, EAT1-dependent and ST.2-enriched lincRNAs were extracted according to the same conditions described above for coding genes.For sRNA-seq, 1 μg of total RNA was provided for library construction by NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs). The libraries were 9-plexed per lane and sequenced by HiSeq2500 (illumina) with SR52, a 2-bp extended version of SR50, for higher-quality sequencing. After trimming by QuasR, 24-nt long sRNA-seq reads were extracted by ShortRead [72], and mapped to the rice IRGSP1.0 genome using Tophat, in which reads having >50 multi-hits on rice genome or any mismatches were cut off (-N 0 -g 50). If 24-nt RNAs with >10 FPKM values were mapped on each of EAT1-dependent and ST.2-enriched lincRNA loci identified above, the loci were defined as 24-PHAS loci. Regional abundance of mRNA-seq and 24-nt sRNA-seq reads mapped on the rice genome (shown in Fig 4A) was calculated in a sliding window (window; 50 kbp, step; 25 kbp) by BEDtools. Conserved motifs were searched in each 24-PHAS locus, in addition to 200 bp regions both upstream and downstream sequences, by MEME SUITE program [35]. Phased scores were calculated as described by Howell et al. [73].Degradome-seq data analysisA degradome-seq dataset from young panicles of indica rice variety, cv. 93–11, was obtained from Sequence Read Archive of DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ-SRA) under the accession code SRR034102 [38]. Adaptor sequence and low-quality reads were removed using FASTX-toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and the reads retaining 20- or 21-nt length were mapped onto rice IRGSP1.0 genome using Bowtie 2 [74]. The frequency of 5’-end of mapped reads were manually examined within and around 24-PHAS loci identified in this study (S4 Table).5ʹ RACETo determine the TSS of two 24-PHASs and a pri-miR2275 (chr5-20, chr6-97 and pri-miR2275b), the standard 5ʹ rapid amplification cDNA end (5ʹ RACE) method was applied using a GeneRacer kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), total RNA from ST.2 wild-type anther, and gene specific primers (S6 Table). Eight clones from each locus were sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and a PRISM 3130xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and the end of the longest read(s) was marked as TSS.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCRRice young panicles from transgenic derivatives were fixed, and the anthers at early meiosis (around 0.5 mm) were supplied for ChIP as described previously [75]. The anti-GFP antibody No.598 and the normal rabbit IgG (both from MBL International) were used for positive and negative ChIP experiments, respectively. The extracted DNAs were analyzed by real-time qPCR using region-specific primers (S6 Table). The 1/10 volume of chromatin-containing samples without IP treatment was prepared for the input samples.Transient expression assay in rice protoplastThe 2-kbp upstream sequences from the translational start site of 24-PHAS (chr5-20, chr6-97), DCL5, EAT1 and DCL3a genes, all originated from the japonica rice cv. Nipponbare, were inserted in the upstream of the firefly Luciferase CDS and the nopaline synthase (nos) terminator. This reporter construct was cloned into pBSII-SK(-) plasmid (S10A Fig). For the effector construct, the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter was fused with the cDNAs of EAT1, TIP2, TDR and UDT1 genes, originated from Nipponbare ST.2 anthers, with the nos terminator. and cloned into pBSII-SK(-) (S10A Fig). For normalization of the firefly Luciferase activity, the Luciferase cDNA of Renilla reniformis were fused with the CaMV35S promoter and the nos terminator, inserted into pBSII-SK(-) (S10A Fig), and cotransfected with the effector and reporter constructs as an internal control in all experiments. All PCR primers for the above constructions were listed in S6 Table. PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) was used for PCR amplification according to the manufacturer's instruction. Protoplast preparation from rice seedlings, transfection of plasmids, and protein extraction from protoplasts were according to the method previously described [76]. The Luciferase activity was detected using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and Filter MAX F5 multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices).Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of bHLHsA pair of split YFP vectors (pBS-35S-nYFP and pBS-35S-cYFP) were kindly provided by Drs. D. Tsugama (Hokkaido U., Japan) and T. Takano (The U. of Tokyo, Japan) [77]. Each of EAT1, TIP2 and UDT1 cDNAs, originated from Nipponbare ST.2 anthers, was inserted into the either of upstream or downstream of both pBS-35S-nYFP and pBS-35S-cYFP vectors. For the nuclear marker, the rice Histone 2B (H2B) cDNA were fused with the maize Ubiquitine promoter and in-frame with the tagRFP gene (Evrogen), cloned into pPZP2H-lac binary vector [65], and cotransfected with a pair of split YFP constructs in all experiments. All PCR primers used here were listed in S6 Table. PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) was used for PCR. The protoplast preparation and plasmid transfection were same with the method described above. Fluorescent images were captured by Fluoview FV300 CLSM system (Olympus) and processed by Photoshop CS4 (Adobe systems Inc.), under the identical conditions and parameters through all experiments. We tried all sixteen combinations of split YFP constructs to assess EAT1-UDT1 and TIP2-UDT1 interactions, and thirteen combinations of negative controls. However, UDT1-cYFP and cYFP-UDT1 gave the intense signal in a single transfection as negative controls, and excluded from the assay. Then, the total eight combinations of EAT1-UDT1 (EAT1-cYFP/UDT1-nYFP, EAT1-cYFP/nYFP-UDT1, cYFP-EAT1/UDT1-nYFP, cYFP-EAT1/nYFP-UDT1) and TIP2-UDT1 (TIP2-cYFP/UDT1-nYFP, TIP2-cYFP/nYFP-UDT1, cYFP-TIP2/UDT1-nYFP, cYFP-TIP2/nYFP-UDT1) were assayed.RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-seq and analysis of masiRNAsRIP fractions from wild-type, mel1-1 and eat1-4 flowers at ST.1, ST.2 and ST.4, each of which included two biological replicates, were obtained using anti-MEL1 antibody as described previously [11]. Library construction, sequencing, adapter trimming, size filtration and mapping to rice genome were done as well as sRNA-seq methods described above. Reads per million (RPM) values were calculated in the respective 24-nt RNA sequences and compared among wild-type, mel1-1 and eat1-4 fractions. In this process, 24-nt masiRNAs were defined in 24-nt RNA sequences as having ≥15 RPM detected in wild-type ST.1, ST.2 or ST.4 flowers, and ≥RPM 4-fold enriched in wild-type compared to mel1-1.Gene accession numbersEAT1; Os04g0599300, TIP2; Os01g0293100, TDR; Os02g0120500, UDT1; Os07g0549600, MEL1, Os03g0800200, DCL5; Os10g0485600, DCL3a; Os01g0909200, DCL4; Os04g0509300, DCL1; Os03g0121800, RDR6; Os01g0527600, AP25; Os03g0186900.

ImageJ (freely available from National Institutes of Health, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n# A.  Cell cultureNote: This protocol was optimized for nuclear isolation and chromatin fractionation of roughly 4x 107 A549 cells (for A549 cells that are approximately two I O O% confluent 150 mm cell culture dishes). This number of cells was chosen for efficient nuclear isolation as described in Procedure B. This protocol can be used for other cell types but should be optimized accordingly.1.  For each condition, grow roughly 4×10^7 A549 cells in F-12K media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. Note: Time treatments such that the required cell number is reached at the time of harvest.2.  Harvest cells using trypsin and combine into one 15ml tube per condition.3.  Centrifuge for 2 min, 500×g , room temperature using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor SX4750).4.  Wash cells once with 10ml of PBS and centrifuge again for 2 min, 500× g_: room temperature.5.  Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.6.  Flash freeze samples in liquid nitrogen.7.  Store samples at -80~^°C until ready to process.# B.  Nuclear isolationNote: This section describes two alternative methods for nuclear isolation. The procedure detailed in B1 yields a clean nuclear fraction but B2 is recommended for highly mobile nuclear proteins that are lost from the nuclear fraction when mild detergents are used as described in B1 (see example in Figure 2).()# Isolation with detergent# Isolation with DounceFigure 2. Fractionation of nuclear protein HMGB1 can differ depending on the method of nuclear isolation. Western blot of chromatin fractionation of A549 cells using different methods of nuclear isolation. HMGB1 is lost from nuclei during nuclear isolation B1 using NP-40 and a sucrose cushion. HMGB1 is retained in the nuclear fraction during isolation of nuclei with the alternative method described in step B2.1.  Nuclear isolation using mild detergent and sucrose cushion.Note: This section describes permeabilizing the cell membrane using a mild detergent (NP-40), followed by separation of the nuclei from cytoplasmic debris by sucrose cushion. The sucrose cushion consists of a layer with 1.2 M sucrose at the bottom (Buffer II) and a layer with 0.32 M sucrose on top (Buffer I, Figure 3A). The nuclei are more dense than the 1.2 M sucrose buffer and will pellet at the bottom of the tube while the less dense cytoplasmic debris will remain in the upper sucrose layer (Figure 3B).a.  Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).b.  In the meantime, prepare one aliquot each of Buffer I.A and I.B by addition of PMSF, DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail immediately before use (see Recipes for final concentrations). Add NP-40 to Buffer I.B.c.  Gently resuspend cells in _2 m of Buffer I.A using a 5~ml pipette. Avoid the formation of bubbles.d.  Set aside 50ul of the cell suspension in a new tube labeled ‘cells fraction’.e.  Add _2 m of Buffer I.B containing NP-40 to the _2 m of cell suspension and mix gently by inverting the tube 2-3 times.f.  Incubate samples on ice for 10m i n . Mix gently by inverting after 5 min.g.  Pipette 8ml of ice-cold Buffer II into 30ml reusable centrifuge tubes (one per sample).h.  Carefully layer cell suspension onto Buffer II (Figure 3A).i.  If the number of tubes is even, balance the tubes with Buffer I.A before centrifugation. If the number of tubes is uneven, use an additional tube containing water as balance.j. Centrifuge for 20 min, 10,000xg , 4^°C using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor FX6100) with low brakes (deceleration setting 1 for this centrifuge model, 5-10 min of deceleration for other centrifuge models) to avoid disruption of pellet. Note: Use the adapters listed in the Equipment section under 4 to fit the 30 ml reusable centrifuge tubes into the FX6100 rotor. The nuclei form a dense pellet at the bottom of the tube while the cytoplasmic debris remains in the upper sucrose layer, Figure 3C.k.  Carefully remove the supernatant using a transfer pipette. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C.()Figure 3. Intermediate steps of nuclear isolation. A. Layers of the sucrose cushion.

Pellet of nuclei after spin at 10,000xg indicated by red arrow. The buffers were removed before these pictures were taken.# 2.  Nuclear isolation by manual disruptionNote: Using mild detergents such as NP-40 for nuclear isolation is important to ensure that the nuclear membrane remains largely intact. In some cases, highly mobile nuclear proteins such as HMGB1 (Sapojnikova et al., 2005) may diffuse out of the nucleus upon isolation with this method. To prevent loss of these proteins from the nuclear fraction, we adapted an alternative method that relies on a hypotonic buffer and subsequent manual disruption of the cell membrane using a Dounce homogenizer. The short centrifugation times in this step minimize diffusion of these proteins out of the nuclei (Figure 2).a.  Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).b.  Gently resuspend cells in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and transfer into a 1.7 m tube using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips) to avoid disrupting the cellular membranes.c.  Set aside 25ul of the cell suspension in a new tube as ‘cells fraction’. Note: This is proportional to the 50 μl aliquot taken from 2 ml of cell suspension in step B1.d.  Incubate on ice for 30min .e.  Pre-cool the Dounce homogenizer and the pestle on ice for at least 5 min.f.  Transfer the cell suspension to cold Dounce homogenizer using a transfer pipette.# bio-protocolg.  Disrupt the cell membrane using 40 strokes of the tight-fitting pestle. Minimize the formation of bubbles.h.  Transfer sample to 1.7ml tube using a transfer pipette.i. Centrifuge for 5 min, 1,500xg , 4^°C using a tabletop centrifuge.j. Carefully remove the supernatant using a P1000 pipette. Transfer supernatant and label as ‘cytosol fraction’ if desired. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C. Note: The nuclei form a loose pellet at the bottom of the tube that can be easily disturbed. The cytoplasmic fraction in step B1 is too dilute to isolate as a result of the sucrose cushion.# C.  Micrococcal nuclease digestionNote: In this step the DNA is digested to the length of mono-nucleosomes (roughly 150 bp) using MNase. While partial MNase digest in combination with nuclear fractionation by salt gradient can be used to separate euchromatin from heterochromatin (Teves and Henikoff, 2012), our protocol aims to identify global association of proteins with chromatin and does not distinguish between different types of chromatin. Subsequently, it is important that the DNA is completely digested into mononucleosomes to break up chromatin and allow for elution of all soluble proteins in Procedure D (Figure 4). EGTA is used instead of EDTA to stop the MNase digestion as EGTA preferentially chelates C a^2+ ions that are necessary for MNase enzymatic activity but does not impact M g^2+ ions important for protein-protein interactions. Proteins loosely bound to chromatin elute during MNase digest and can be detected in the supernatant collected in this section of the protocol.()Figure 4. Digestion of cellular DNA using MNase. Agarose gel analysis of DNA extracted from nuclei during a time course of MNase treatment. The position of DNA bands corresponding to mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes are indicated on the left while the DNA size in base pairs (bp)is indicated on the right. Without MNase digestion (0 min), cellular DNA barely enters the agarose gel because of the large size of the DNA molecules. After 1 min of MNase digestion, DNA fragments show the characteristic banding pattern of multiples of 150 bp. After 5 min the DNA fragments correspond to one to three nucleosomes in length. After 30 min most DNA fragments are close to 150 bp, indicating the desired digestion of cellular DNA necessary for optimal chromatin fractionation. The high concentration of DNA causes the slightly lower shift of the mono-nucleosome band. The nuclei used for this time course were isolated using method B.1. No differences in MNase digestion efficiency have been observed with nuclei isolated using method B.2.1.  Prepare and cool Buffer III.A and III.B.2.  Add 400ul Buffer III.A to the nuclei.3.  Gently resuspend the nuclei using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips)to avoid disrupting the nuclear membranes.4.  Add 5ul of MNase (1 U) and incubate at 37^°C (in a water bath) for 30 min.5.  Mix every 10 min by gently inverting the tube 2-3 times.6.  After 30m i n , add 25ul of ice-cold 0.1 M EGTA to stop the digest.7.  Set aside a 60~ul aliquot of the nuclear suspension as ‘nuclei fraction’ and for DNA isolation toconfirm the sufficient digest of DNA (described in Procedure E).8.  Centrifuge for 10m i n , 400xg , 4^°C .9.  Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ‘MNase fraction’.10. Wash the nuclei once by resuspending them in 400ul Buffer III.B.11. Centrifuge again for 10 min, 400xg , 4^°C . Discard the supernatant.# D.  Chromatin fractionationNote: In this step the nuclei are further fractionated using buffers with increasing amounts of NaCl. Proteins only weakly bound to DNA are expected to be soluble under low salt conditions and will elute from nuclei in the buffers with low NaCl concentration. Proteins tightly bound to chromatin only become soluble under high salt conditions and only elute from nuclei in the buffers with high NaCl concentration.1.  Gently resuspend the nuclei in 400ul Buffer IV.80 using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips).2.  Rotate at 4^°C for 30m i n .3.  Centrifuge for 10 min, 400× g,4^°C .4.  Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ^°0m M fraction’.5.  Repeat steps D1-D4 with Buffer IV.150, IV.300 and IV.600 in that order. Keep the supernatants as fractions '150m M^ , ^°300m M^ and ^600m M^ , respectively.6.  Prepare samples for Western blot immediately (see Table 1 in Procedure F) or store at -20~^°C .# E.  DNA isolation and DNA gelNote: In this step, DNA is isolated from the samples after MNase digestion to test the length of DNA fragments. The goal is to digest the DNA down to mono-nucleosome level of around 150 bp to ensure optimal chromatin fractionation (Figure 4). It is important that orange G or another small molecular weight dye is used for loading the DNA. Commonly used DNA loading dyes such as bromophenol blue run around the same size as 150 bp of DNA and may obscure the results.1.  Dilute 10ul of the ‘nuclei’ fraction in 90 uI H_2O for better DNA purification.2.  Use a PCR purification kit to isolate the DNA from this sample following the kit instructions. Elute the DNA in 30ul of H_2O .3.  Take out 5~ul (about 5u. ) of DNA and add 1~ul of 6× Orange G. Keep the rest of the DNA on ice until results are finalized or freeze at -20~^°C .4.  Run samples and a 100 bp ladder on a 2% agarose gel containing 1x GelRed at 100 V for 1 h.5.  Visualize the DNA using gel imager and check for prominent DNA band of around 150 bp with minimal DNA laddering (Figure 4).F.  Verifying the quality of nuclear fractionation by Western blotNote: The quality of the nuclear fractionation can be analyzed using SDS-PAGE combined with Western blotting (Figure 1G). Efficient nuclear isolation can be tested by probing for proteins such as tubulin that are only found in the cytoplasm. The quality of chromatin fractionation can be tested by probing for histone proteins such as histone H3 or proteins expected to bind histone tails such as bromodomain containing protein Brd1 (Sanchez et al., 2014). The interaction of the histone H3 and Brd1 with chromatin should only be disrupted under high salt conditions. In addition, proteomics can be performed to identify changes to global chromatin composition under different conditions. Further details concerning mass spectrometry of salt fractions can be found in (Avgousti et al., 2016). 1.  Prepare samples for analysis by Western blotting according to Table 1.Table 1. Preparation of different fractions for Western blot()2.  Denature samples at 95^°C (in a heat block) for 10min .3.  Analyze 15~ul of each sample via SDS-PAGE and Western blot.

Since salt disrupts charged-based protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, chromatin-associated proteins become more soluble with increasing concentration of NaCl (Teves and Henikoff, 2012). Proteins strongly bound to DNA are expected to elute with high salt whereas loosely bound proteins, such as transcription factors, will elute with low salt. We are specifically interested in how virus infection alters the composition of factors associated with the cellular chromatin. Nuclear replicating viruses, such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and EpsteinBarr virus, dramatically alter the appearance of the host chromatin during infection (Avgousti et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2010; Simpson-Holley et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2013). We hypothesized that these changes in appearance are partly due to differences in protein composition of host chromatin. Changes in host chromatin could reflect antiviral defenses mounted by the cell or active manipulation by the virus. To compare association of proteins with chromatin in uninfected and infected cells we developed this protocol to fractionate nuclei using a salt gradient (Figure 1). In this protocol we isolate nuclei, digest the DNA down to mono-nucleosome length, and then wash the nuclei with increasing concentrations of salt, collecting each fraction for analysis by Western blotting. We recently used this protocol to elucidate changes to cellular chromatin during infection with adenovirus (Avgousti et al., 2016). We now present this protocol as a general approach to monitor association of proteins with chromatin under a wide range of perturbing conditions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2175"}}

Animal work was approved by the South Kensington and St. Mary’s AWERB committee, Imperial College London.Precision-cut lung slicing and in vitro culturePrecision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were obtained from mouse lungs according to the protocol described in ref. 19, with some modifications. Post-natal day 3 (P3), P7, P14 and adult C57BL/6 mice were humanely killed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The anterior chest wall was excised and trachea was carefully exposed. A tiny opening was made in the anterior wall of the trachea just below the cricoid cartilage. A rigid metallic cannula (25G for P3, 23G for P7 and 21G for P14 and adult mice) was carefully inserted through the trachea up to a millimetre above the bifurcation of the principal bronchi and fixed in place by suture. After cannulation, the lungs were inflated with 37 °C 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (Sigma; Cat. No. A9414) prepared with 1× HBSS/HEPES buffer (Life Technology; Cat. No. 14025-050). Agarose was injected to inflate both lungs keeping them in situ within the chest cavity at volume that enabled lungs to be fully inflated without hyper- or sub-optimal inflation (P3, 0.2 ml, P7, 0.275 ml, P14 0.35 ml and adult 1 ml agarose for PCLS or PBS for histology). These volumes were used for respective age groups throughout all experiments. After inflation, agarose was solidified by applying ice to the chest cavity for 1 min. Subsequently, the lungs were excised from the body along with heart and trachea and immersed in ice-cold serum-free DMEM (SF-DMEM) (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 31966-021), and kept on ice until slicing. Left lung lobes were isolated and cut transversely at 300 µm using an automated vibratome (Compresstome® VF-300-0Z; Precisionary Instruments LLC) in ice-cold HBSS/HEPES buffer. Slices were obtained from the middle 2/3rds of the lobe, to ensure similar sized slices, and placed in a 24-well plate in ice-cold SF-DMEM for all experiments. Using this technique, a P3 left lung provides 12 slices and an adult lung provides approximately 36 slices. PCLS were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and washed twice with warm SF-DMEM to remove excess agarose from the tissue. Slices were incubated for a further 1 h in SF-DMEM at 37 °C. To select the optimal media for PCLS culture, adult PCLS were cultured for up to 96 h in presence of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in either SF-DMEM or in M199 media (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 11150059) supplemented with Insulin/transferrin/selenium (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 41400045), vitamin C (Cat. No. A4403), vitamin A (Cat. No. R2625), hydrocortisone (Cat. No. H4001) (All from Sigma) as described previously ref. 19. Both media were supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 15140122) and media was changed every other day.Viability assaysTo assess cell viability and metabolic activity, lung slices were collected following 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 and 96 h in culture. Cell viability was assessed by MTT, Caspase, and Live/Dead assays.MTT assay: To assess metabolic activity within cells, for each experiment, similar size PCLS were placed into wells of a 24-well plate in duplicate (1 slice per well). MTT assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma; Cat. No. M2128). Briefly, 10% MTT solution (Stock Con. 5 mg/ml) was prepared in SF-DMEM and 500 µl solution was added per well, per slice and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, formazan crystals that formed within the viable cells were solubilised by adding an equal volume of DMSO for 10 min and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. 200 µl of eluted formazan solution from each slice was placed into individual wells of a 96-well plate. Absorbance (OD) was measured at 570 nm and corrected at 690 nm using a plate reader.Caspase assay: To detect caspase-3 activity, marking apoptotic cells in PCLS, NucView 488 Caspase-3 assay kit was used following manufacturer’s instructions (Biotium; Cat. No. 30029-T). Briefly, PCLS were plated in 24-well plate (1 slice/well) and 250 µl of 5 µM NucView 488 substrate prepared in SF-DMEM media was added and incubated in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Slices were then washed 3 times with HBSS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 30 min in the dark, then washed 3 times and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma; Cat. No. D9542) at 1:500 dilution (Stock concentration 10 mg/ml) for 30 min. Slices were mounted on glass slides and images were captured with a Zeiss Axio Observer widefield microscope using a ×20, 0.8 NA air objective and Zen2 acquisition software, blue version).Live/Dead assay: Cell viability in PCLS was assessed using LIVE/DEAD® Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit following manufacturer’s instruction (ThermoFisher Scientific; Cat. No. L3224). PCLS were incubated with 2 µM Calcein AM and 2 µM Ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) in 250 µm HBSS for 30 min at 37 °C. Then washed two times with HBSS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 30 min at RT and washed. PCLS treated with 70% methanol for 30 min at RT were used as a positive control for dead cells and media treated PCLS were used as a positive control for live cells. Samples were mounted on glass slides with ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific; Cat. No. P36930) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope with a ×20 0.8 NA air objective and ZEN 2009 (black edition) software.Live cell staining of PCLS and time-lapse imagingFor dual live cell staining with EpCAM-FITC, SiR-DNA, PCLS were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with FITC-conjugated EpCAM antibody at 1:200 (eBioscience; Cat. No. 11-5791-80; Clone G8.8) and silicon rhodamine far-red fluorophore-conjugated DNA minor groove binder bisbenzimide (SiR-DNA) at 1:300 (tebu-bio ltd; Cat. No. SC007) or Alexa-647 conjugated PECAM antibody (CD31-Alexa 647; Biolegend; Cat No 102416; Clone 390) at 1:200 with EpCAM-FITC in 500 µl SF-DMEM per sample (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 21063029). Slices were then washed three times with SF-DMEM and for imaging, were either immediately imaged or fixed with 10% buffered formalin and stored at 4 °C for later imaging. For time-lapse imaging, the EpCAM-FITC, SiR-DNA or EpCAM-FITC, PECAM labelled PCLS were immediately placed at the centre of the well of an uncoated ibidi 24-well µ-plate (ibidi; Cat. No. 82401). Then a 0.4 µm pore, 12 mm transwell (Corning; Cat. No. 3460) was placed onto the PCLS, with the rim of the transwell removed to allow the transwell filter to contact the slice at the bottom of the well (Fig. 1a). Image media, containing EpCAM-FITC at 1:500 and SiR-DNA at 1:1000 or PECAM at 1:500 in phenol-free SF-DMEM, was then added to the upper chamber (500 µl) and bottom chamber (300 µl). Finally, to keep the PCLS in place, a 1.66 g metal flat washer (M8- 5/16th inches diameter) was placed on top of the transwell housing (Fig. 1a). The PCLS were then left in the incubator for 2 h. This incubation step ensures the cells are all labelled and allows the slice to settle down prior to image acquisition. The 24-well plate was then transferred to a pre-equilibrated and humidified incubator chamber of an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer widefield epifluorescence microscope and PCLS were kept in the following conditions: 37 °C, 5% CO2 and room air oxygen levels, approx. 21%. Imaging was conducted using a long working distance ×40 (0.7 NA, air) objective lens. The 2 h incubation and pre-equilibration of the microscope incubator were crucially important to avoid the plane of focus drifting during time-lapse image acquisition. Slices that were subject to brightfield imaging only, were not stained but were otherwise prepared and set up as for stained slices. In each experiment, a minimum of duplicate slices for each experimental group, were imaged. A maximum of four slices were imaged in a single time-lapse experiment e.g., two in DMSO control media and two blebbistatin or cyto-D treated. Images were captured using brightfield, GFP filter, excitation 450–490 nm, emission 500–550 nm (for EpCAM-FITC) and Cy-5, excitation 625–655 nm, emission 665–715 nm (for SiR-DNA) from 4 fields per slice for 8–19 h at 15 min intervals or 64 h at 60 min intervals. Eleven images were captured along the z-axis with 1 µm step-gap to make a z-stack from each slice.Staining of PCLSPCLS were dual stained with EpCAM-FITC, SiR-DNA as above and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. To prevent non-specific binding and to permeabilise the tissue, fixed PCLS were then incubated in PBSBT (1% BSA; Sigma, Cat. No. A7030 and 0.5% Triton-X 100; Sigma Cat. No. X100 in PBS) for 1 h at RT in the dark. Samples were then stained with anti-mouse CD11c-PE primary antibody (Biolegend; Cat. No. 117307; Clone N418) at 1:200 to label macrophages or with rabbit anti-pro-surfactant protein-C (Sp-C) antibody (Millipore; Cat. No. AB3786) or anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma; Cat. No.C2931; Clone C-11) at 1:250 in PBSBT and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, EpCAM-FITC, CD11c-PE, SiR-DNA labelled samples were washed and mounted onto glass slides with ProLong® Gold Antifade reagent. For Sp-C and pan-cytokeratin samples were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen; Cat. No. A-11011) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 647, respectively at 1:250 dilution in PBSBT for 1 h at RT. EpCAM-FITC, Sp-C, SiR-DNA stained slices were then mounted onto glass slides as above. EpCAM-FITC, Pan-cytokeratin dual labelled slices were counter-stained with DAPI and mounted on glass slides as above. For Sp-C, Cd11c-PE dual labelling, goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen; Cat. No. A-11008) antibody was used to visualise Sp-C at 1:250 and counterstained with DAPI and mounted as above. For DAPI and Ki67 or Sp-C staining, PCLS were first fixed with 10% formalin, blocked and permeabilised as above. Samples were then incubated with a combination of anti-mouse and rat Ki67 primary antibody (eBioscience; Cat. No. 14-5698-82; Clone SolA15) at 1:500 and Sp-C antibody at 1:250 at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies were visualised using secondary antibodies goat anti-rat IgG, Alexa Fluor 568 (Cat. No. A-11077) for Ki67 and goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat. No. A-11008) for SP-C, both from Invitrogen at 1:250 dilution. Nuclear staining was achieved by incubating slices with DAPI for 30 min and samples were then mounted onto glass slides as above. To confirm that there was no non-specific binding of conjugated fluorophores used for live-cell time-lapse imaging, unlabelled P3 mouse lung slices were stained with secondary isotype IgG antibodies: rat IgG-FITC (eBioscience; Cat. No. 11-4321-42) for EpCAM-FITC or Armenian hamster IgG-PE (Biolegend; Cat. No. 400907) for CD11c or rat IgG-Alexa Fluor 647 (Biolegend; Cat. No. 400526) for PECAM at 1:200 for 1 h at RT and counterstained with DAPI and then mounted on glass slides as above. Images were captured using either Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope, with Lumencor Spectra X LED light source and Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 camera, using ×40, 0.7 NA, air objective (for EpCAM-FITC, CD11c-PE, SiR-DNA and PECAM or Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope, using ×20, 0.8 NA, air objective (for Ki67 and Sp-C; and for secondary isotype IgG antibodies).Blebbistatin and cytochalasin-D treatment of PCLSTo investigate the effects of blebbistatin and cytochalasin-D on ex vivo alveologenesis, P3 PCLS were treated with 50 µM para-Nitroblebbistatin (blebbistatin, Cayman Chemical Company; 13891) or 100 ng/ml cytochalasin D (cyto-D, Sigma; C8273). To evaluate the inhibitors’ effects on cell migration, 12–19 h time-lapse imaging experiments were conducted. For this, PCLS were first labelled with EpCAM-FITC and SiR-DNA live dyes and prepared for imaging as previously described. 50 µM blebbistatin or 100 ng/ml cyto-D in image media was added to the slices (500 µl in upper chamber, 300 µl in bottom chamber of the transwell). Slices were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h prior to beginning time-lapse acquisition, as previously described. Blebbistatin and cyto-D were reconstituted using DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in the working media was 0.2% and 0.01%, respectively. Therefore control media for blebbistatin and cyto-D was phenol-free SF-DMEM containing 0.2% or 0.01% DMSO, respectively. In some time-lapse experiments, blebbistatin and cyto-D were used on un-labelled PCLS for brightfield imaging only. To evaluate the effects of blebbistatin and cyto-D ex vivo alveologenesis, cell proliferation and Sp-C positive ATII epithelial cells, un-labelled P3 PCLS were cultured in SF-DMEM supplemented with 50 µM blebbistatin or 100 ng/ml cyto-D for 72 h under normal culture (non-imaging) conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). Media was changed every alternate day. DMSO controls were as described for time-lapse experiments. Slices were fixed with 10% formalin as above for histology sectioning and morphometric analysis.Morphometric analysis of lung tissueTo evaluate alveologenesis, mean linear intercept (Lm) and the number of airspaces were quantified in H&E stained lung sections from P3 PCLS cultured for 72 h or left lobes of lungs from different post-natal age groups following histological staining as follows: P3 PCLS at t = 0 and t = 72 h culture were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 30 min, embedded in paraffin, keeping the slice surfaces horizontal to the block and sectioned at 4 µm thickness. Sections were deparaffinised and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin. Three separate experiments were conducted with three individual mice.For whole lung processing, lungs from P3, P7, P14 or adult mice were inflated with PBS using age-specific, defined volumes (described above) and fixed in 10% formalin overnight at 4 °C. Following fixation, left lung lobes were paraffin embedded, sectioned along the long axis and H&E stained, as above. Quantification was carried out on three mice for each age group. Images were captured using a Leica DM2500 widefield microscope and a ×20 , 0.7 NA objective. For quantification of Lm, a grid of eight horizontal lines was superimposed on images from H&E sections, using FIJI (ImageJ, version 2.0)40. The number of times alveolar cells intercepted the line was counted and Lm was calculated using the following equation: Lm = NL/X, where N = number of lines counted, L = length of line, and X = total number of intercepts counted. A minimum of three fields per lung section, and three sections per PCLS or per left lobe were imaged. In the graphs, each dot represents per field count. The number of alveolar spaces/airspace per field was counted and presented as number of airspaces per millimetre square area. Alveolar spaces were quantified from the same visual fields used for Lm quantification. Fields of view containing blood vessels or airways were omitted from analysis.Quantification of cell behavioursTo quantify cellular events, such as, cell clustering, hollowing, septation and cell extension that observed during time-lapse imaging (×40 objective), the number of times each event was observed in a single field of view obtained from a movie file was recorded. A total of 12 time-lapse fields from three separate experiments were examined. The frequency of each type of cellular behaviour was determined by expressing the total number of observations of that behaviour/number of fields analysed. The mean number of alveoli per field of view was 5.66.Cell tracking and proliferation analysis using Icy softwareIcy (version 1.9.8.0), an open source bioimaging analysis software, created by the Quantitative Image Analysis Unit at Insitut Pasteur, Paris, France, was used for cell tracking and migration quantification during time-lapse imaging33. EpCAM-FITC, SiR-DNA labelled raw time-lapse sequences from each field of a lung slice were up-loaded into Icy and EpCAM-positive cells were tracked. Results were manually checked to ensure tracking was correct.Cell tracking: EpCAM-FITC positive cells were tracked for quantification of epithelial cell migration41. FITC-channel was selected from best-focused slice from a z-stack for tracking. Cell migration in the X–Y plane only (not the Z-plane) was recorded. We focused on two aspects of tracking data: (1) Net cell migration within a specified time-lapse period, in which the mean value was calculated to present how much linear distance in the X–Y axis (Initial point A to end point B) a cell had migrated. A mean value of migrated distances of total number of cells from each field is presented as mean net cell migration, (2) we also looked at the net distance travelled by individual cells in a field within a specified time period in each experimental group. The same duration was used for all groups within one experiment enabling direct comparison to be made between groups within that experiment. Within the PCLS a majority of cells were relatively sessile and migrated less than 2 µm. However, a subpopulation of epithelial cells were highly motile. To determine the proportion of these highly motile cells we quantified the percentage of cells that migrated between 6 and 14 µm per field within a defined time period (8 h for Fig. 2 and 14 h for Figs. 6 and 8). Two to four fields from each slice were analysed. Each dot in the graphs represents either mean value of migration distances of total cells per field for (mean net cell migration graphs) or the distance a single cell migrated (individual net cell migration graphs) as specified in the figure legends. Three independent experiments were conducted using three mice per group/age. Using this strategy, cell migration was analysed in time-lapse sequences of 8 h in P3, P7, P14 and adult mice PCLS, and 14 h duration for blebbistatin/cyto-D treated and control groups as described in previous sections.Cell proliferation: The Spot detection tool in Icy was utilised to quantify the percentage of Ki67 and Sp-C positive cells within fixed PCLS samples following 24 and 72 hr culture in presence and absence of blebbistatin, using confocal images of Ki67/Sp-C/DAPI immunostained slices. At least four fields from each PCLS at each time point were selected for quantification. Three experiments were conducted on PCLS prepared from three P3 mice.Manual quantification of cell proliferation in vivo and in PCLSTo quantify the percentage of cell proliferation in the alveoli at different developmental ages, lungs from P3, P7, P14 and adult mice were inflated with PBS using age-specific, defined volumes (described above) and fixed in 10% formalin overnight at 4 °C. Following fixation, left lung lobes were paraffin embedded, sectioned along the long axis and immunostained with anti-mouse/rat Ki67 primary antibody (eBioscience; Cat. No. 14-5698-82; Clone SolA15) at 1:500 at 4 °C overnight. Secondary treatment was done using HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit; Cat. No. PK-6104) and visualised using DAB Substrate Kit (BD Pharmingen; Cat. No. 550880) following manufacturer’s instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin. 200 cells were counted along the alveolar wall per section using a Leica DM2500 widefield microscope and a ×20 , 0.7 NA objective. Percentage of Ki67 positive cells was calculated. Quantification was made on three sections from each lung, and three lungs from each age group (n = 3 mice each group).For quantification of proliferation in PCLS, slices were stained with Ki67, EpCAM-FITC and DAPI as previously described. The total percentage of proliferating cells was determined by manual counting of the total number of Ki67 positive cells per field and expressing this as a percentage of total cells per field. The percentage of proliferating epithelial cells was calculated by counting the number of dual EpCAM, Ki67 positive cells per field and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of Ki67 positive cells per field. Counting was done manually at ×40 magnification and 6 separate fields of view were counted at P3 and P7 with at least 200 cells per field.Image deconvolution and movie generationZ-stacks, either single; static or multiple; time-lapse, were acquired by widefield microscopy. Each z-stack consisted of 11 separate z-slices per sample, with a 1 µm step between slices. Static and time-lapse z-stack images were deconvolved using Huygens deconvolution software from Scientific Volume Imaging (SVI, Essential version 17.10). The automated CMLE algorithm was used for all image deconvolution in this study. Post-deconvolved, time-lapse z-stacks were then imported into Icy to generate videos (.avi file format). 2D videos and static images shown in the manuscript are from the best-focused single z-plane within a z-stack. For 3D video reconstruction, deconvolved z-stack time-lapse files were imported into NIS-Elements (Version 4.50, Nikon Instruments, UK) and aligned to correct for X–Y drift. 3D movies were generated using the ‘Volume View’ and ‘Movie Maker’ modules of NIS-Elements. Raw image files were used to generate brightfield time-lapse movies.Statistical analysisData were analysed using GraphPad Prism version 5 or Excel (Office 2011 version). Data are presented as the mean values for each experimental group with variation represented as ± SEM (standard error of mean). Differences between two groups were tested using Mann-Whitney U-test or paired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Differences between three or more groups were tested using One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. A ‘p’ value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The number of experiments (n number) is noted in the respective figure legends throughout the manuscript.Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6414680.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Design and Functional Analysis of Fluorescent Nitrate and Peptide Transporter Activity Sensors in Yeast Cultures","text":"Design and Functional Analysis of Fluorescent Nitrate and Peptide Transporter Activity Sensors in Yeast Cultures\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Sensor designFor yeast expression, CHL1/NRT1.1 or PTRs coding regions were inserted by Gateway LR reactions into the E.coli/yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30, a destination vector that sandwiches the sensory domain between Aphrodite t9 and mCerulean (Jones et al., 2014), following manufacturer’s instructions. The E. coli/yeast vector pDRFlip30 is used for expressing the NiTracs or PepTracs from a PMA1 (yeast proton ATPase) promoter fragment. pDRFlip30 contains the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) terminator, and the URA3 marker for auxotrophy selection in yeast (Figure 1). pDRFlip30 is a vector that allows us to sandwich the transporter of interest by translational fusion between an N-terminal Aphrodite t9 (AFPt9) variant (aphrodite is a codon-diversified gene producing Venus; Deuschle et al., 2006), lacking nine amino acids at its C-terminus and a C-terminal monomeric Cerulean (mCer; Rizzo et al., 2006).B.  Yeast transformationThe  protease-deficient  yeast  strain  BJ5465  MATa ura3­52 trp1 leu2­Δ1 his3­Δ 200 pep4::HIS3 prb1­Δ1.6R can1 GAL  is  transformed  with  the  pDRFlip30  vector containing the desired NiTracs and PepTracs by using the modified Lithium Acetatemethod from Gietz et al., 1992. In brief:1.  Inoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30^°C overnight to O D_600n m0.5 .2.  Spin down (2,000xg) 1 ml of cells in microfuge tube (15 sec) for each transformation.3.  Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100ul of liquid medium by vortexing.4.  Add 2ul of 10m g/m l carrier DNA, vortex.5.  Add 1 u plasmid, vortex.6.  Add 20ul~1 M DTT, vortex.7.  Add 0.5ml of ‘PLATE mixture’ ( 100ml stock containing 90ml of 45% PEG4000, 10 ml of 1 M lithium acetate, 1 ml of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2ml of 0.5 M EDTA), vortex.8.  Incubate at RT for 68 h or overnight.9.  Heat-shock cells for 10 min at 42^°C .10. Place pipet tip directly into bottom of tube, withdraw 50-100~ul of cells and plate cells on solid -ura DropOut medium. Plates are wrapped with plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration.11. Plates are incubated (lid down) at 30^°C for 2-3 days.C.  Detection of NiTrac and PepTrac responses in yeast using a fluorimeter1.  Single colonies are picked using sterile pipette tips and grown in a 50ml tube containing 10ml -ura DropOut liquid medium. Pick at least three independent colonies. Use fresh transformation; do not keep colonies for more than one week on plates to avoid mutations in yeast or plasmid.2.  Place tubes in a rack and incubate in an incubator for 15h under agitation (230 rpm) at 30^°C until the culture reaches O D_600n m0.5 .3.  Liquid cultures are subcultured after dilution to O D600n m~0.01 in the same liquid medium and grown at 30^°C until OD600nm reaches 0.2 .4.  Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4,000× g_: , RT for 7 min, to sediment the cells.5.  Discard the supernatant and resuspend the sediment by vortexing in 10mI ‘Wash buffer’, 15 sec, RT.6.  Centrifuge as described above (step B4).7.  Wash the sediment two more times as in step B4 to B6, to remove traces of growth medium.8.  Resuspend the sediment to O D_600n m0.5 in ‘Resuspension buffer’.9.  Mix cells well and aliquot 100ul of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate.10. Fluorescence is measured in a fluorescence plate reader, in bottom reading mode using 7.5~n m bandwidth for both excitation and emission. Typically, emission spectra are recorded with the following instrument settings: λem 470-570 nm for donor (mCer), step size 5 nm, gain: 75; and λem 520-570 nm for AFPt9, step size 5 nm, gain: 75. Fluorescence from cultures harboring pDRFlip30 (donor: mCer) is measured with excitation at ambda_exc428n m ; AFPt9 is measured with excitation at λexc 500 nm.11. A single- or multichannel pipette is used to add 100~ul of the culture to wells (mix by pipetting up and down) and to add analyte solution to the cells. Set up at least three replicates per treatment. Try to add equal amounts of solutions to reduce variability and use well-calibrated pipettes since the assays are quantitative and sensitive to differences in volumes/ concentration of sensor and analyte.12. Record the fluorescence immediately (as fast as possible) after substrate or control solution addition. It takes about 10 min to read a full 96 well plate with the parameters mentioned above. For highly accurate analyses, measure only a few wells at a time to reduce differences in analysis time. It is also possible to use instruments with injectors that allow for immediate recording; use rapid switching between wells to record over time.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Sensor Design\nInsert CHL1/NRT1.1 or PTRs coding regions into the E.coli/yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30 by Gateway LR reactions.\nUse the E. coli/yeast vector pDRFlip30 for expressing the NiTracs or PepTracs from a PMA1 promoter fragment.\npDRFlip30 contains the ADH terminator and the URA3 marker for auxotrophy selection in yeast.\n## Yeast Transformation\nInoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30°C overnight to OD600nm ~0.5.\nSpin down 1 ml of cells in a microfuge tube and resuspend in 100ul of liquid medium.\n## Transformation Procedure\nAdd 2ul of 10mg/ml carrier DNA and vortex.\nAdd 1ul plasmid and vortex.\nAdd 20ul of 1M DTT and vortex.\nAdd 0.5ml of 'PLATE mixture' and vortex.\nIncubate at RT for 6-8 hours or overnight.\nHeat-shock cells for 10 minutes at 42°C.\nPlace cells on solid -ura DropOut medium and incubate at 30°C for 2-3 days.\n## Detection of NiTrac and PepTrac Responses in Yeast\nPick single colonies and grow in 10ml -ura DropOut liquid medium.\nIncubate in an incubator for 15 hours under agitation at 30°C until the culture reaches OD600nm ~0.5.\n## Cell Preparation\nSubculture after dilution to OD600nm ~0.01 in the same liquid medium.\nGrow at 30°C until OD600nm reaches 0.2.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 4,000×g, RT for 7 minutes.\nWash cells with 'Wash buffer' and resuspend in 'Resuspension buffer'.\n## Fluorescence Measurement\nMix cells well and aliquot 100ul of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate.\nMeasure fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader using specific instrument settings.\nAdd analyte solution to the cells and record fluorescence immediately after addition.","keywords":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1728"}}

Individual clones were screened by immunoblotting using α-TDP43 (Proteintech #10782-2-AP; 1:5,000 dilution) and α-alpha-tubulin (Sigma T6199; 1:10,000 dilution) primary antibodies with IR680LT donkey α-mouse (LiCor #926–68022; 1:10,000) and IR800CM donkey α-rabbit (LiCor #926–32213) secondary antibodies for detection with a LiCor Odyssey imager. Single-cell clones lacking TDP43 protein were further analyzed by qPCR after total RNA extraction with Trizol (Invitrogen), cDNA synthesis with the iScript kit (Bio-Rad) and quantification with the SYBR green kit (Bio-Rad) on a QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. HEK-293T TDP43 knock-out cells were cultured as the parent HEK-293T cells.To generate stable HEK-293T cell lines, the indicated GFP-TDP43 CTD variants were cloned into pLenti-CMV Puro DEST (Addgene #17452) and transfected into HEK-293T cells together with pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) to produce lentiviral particles for transduction. Virus was harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection, pooled, filtered through non-binding 45 µm syringe filters (Pall Corporation) and used to transduce HEK-293T TDP43 knock-out cells. After 24 h, the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with selection medium containing 2 µg/ml Puromycin (Sigma–Aldrich). After 7 days of selection, cells were bulk sorted for similar GFP levels (where possible) using a Sony SH800 flow cytometer. See Supplementary Fig. 8 for comparison of nuclear GFP-TDP43 levels in stable add-back lines after sorting and Supplementary Fig. 10 for sort gates. All stable HEK-293T GFP-TDP43 cell lines were cultured as the parent HEK-293T cells.Bioinformatics analysisSource code is available on Github (https://github.com/RohatgiLab/TDP43-analysis). In short, the NCBI blastp suite was used to retrieve 394 vertebrate TDP43 homologs, with human TDP43 (UniProtKB Q13148 [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148]) as the query in a search limited to taxid:7742. A species and isoform filter was applied to remove sequence redundancy, reducing the dataset to 101 TDP43 homologs. Based on sequence alignments to the well-characterized RNA-binding domain of human TDP43 (PDB:4bs211), the dataset was split up into sub-collections of N-terminal domains, RRM domains and C-terminal domains. The latter was further dissected into the IDR and CR collections using sequence alignments to the previously described CR12,15. To determine the density distribution of hydrophobic residues in the IDRs (but not CRs), we calculated the number of V, L, I, M, F, Y, and W residues in each IDR and normalized the values to a reference length of 100 amino acids. Hydrophobicity was calculated according to the scale of Fauchère and Pliska24, which we re-scaled to range between 0 and 1 for clarity. For the comparison of hydrophobicity scales in Supplementary Fig. 1c, the ProtScale tool from the ExPASy suite was used.DNA constructsAll plasmids used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Sequences and maps are made available on Addgene. All compositional IDR mutants were designed in silico, synthesized as gBlocks by Integrated DNA Technologies and introduced into TDP43 using Gibson cloning. IDR point mutations were introduced by Gibson-based site-directed mutagenesis.Phase separation reporter assayHEK-293T cells were seeded onto acid-washed coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma–Aldrich) in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, allowed to adhere overnight and transfected with the indicated reporter constructs (500 ng/well) using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). Twenty four hour after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, washed 3× with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma–Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3× with PBS and mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Diamond mounting medium containing DAPI (Molecular Probes). After curing overnight at room temperature, z-stacks were automatically taken for all samples at 16 randomly-selected positions across each coverslip with a Leica DMI-6000B microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal unit at ×20 resolution. A 488-nm laser was used for GFP excitation and an Andor iXon Ultra DU888 EMCCD camera for signal detection.For quantification, custom-written Mathematica pipelines were used that are available on Github (https://github.com/RohatgiLab/TDP43-analysis). In short, the ImageFocus-Combine function of Mathematica (Wolfram Research) was first used to make z-projections for each acquired z-stack. Using the DAPI channel, nuclear masks were then generated and used to (i) extract single nuclei and (ii) measure nuclear GFP levels. To subsequently compare the GFP levels of TDP43 droplet-free or droplet-containing nuclei, the morphological component analysis package of Mathematica was used to automatically detect spherical objects and classify the extracted nuclei accordingly. Mis-classifications where manually corrected if necessary. Non-transfected cells (within the population of transfected cells) were excluded from analysis by filtering based on the nuclear GFP signal of a non-transfected control cell population. At least 2000 nuclei per sample were quantified.To compare total reporter expression levels, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, transfected as above, harvested 24 h later and at least 10,000 analyzed by flow cytometry with a BD Accuri C6 instrument (excitation laser: 488 nm, emission filter: 586/40 nm). A graphical overview of the gating strategy can be found in Supplementary Fig. 11.Phase dynamics reporter assayHEK-293T cells were seeded into eight-well ibidi µ-slides (3 × 104 cells/well), allowed to adhere overnight and transfected with the indicated reporter constructs (300 ng/well) using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). Twenty four hour later, the culture medium was exchange with L-15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells imaged using a Leica SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 488-nm laser, ×63 glycerol objective (NA 1.3) and a temperature-controlled incubation chamber (Life Imaging Services) set to 37 °C.Half-bleach experiments were recorded and quantified using the FRAP module of the Leica Application Suite X software. To ensure that only similarly-sized droplets of comparable intensities were bleached, the same bleach window and detector settings were used. For each recorded time point (t), the fluorescence intensities within the bleached droplet hemisphere were then normalized to the fluorescence intensity of the corresponding unbleached droplet hemisphere. These normalized, time-dependent fluorescence intensities It were then used to calculate the fluorescence recovery (FR) according to the following formula:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{FR}}\\left( {\\mathrm{t}} \\right) = \\left( {{\\mathrm{I}_t}} - {I_{\\mathrm{t0}}} \\right)/\\left( {\\mathrm{I}}_{\\hbox{before bleaching}} - {\\mathrm{I}_{t}} - {I_{\\mathrm{t0}}} \\right)$$\\end{document}FRt=It−It0∕Ibeforebleaching−It−It0with t0 being the first time point observed after photobleaching. At least five individual droplets from different cells were analyzed and GraphPad Prism was used to plot replicate measurements (mean ± SD). WT reporter constructs were included in all experiments as a control for comparison across dataset. For all measurements and initial fluorescence signal quantifications, investigators were blinded to prevent bias.Live-cell imaging of TDP43 phase formationTo follow TDP43 reporter phase formation over time, cells were transfected as above and imaged in L15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C every hour for a total of 24 h after transfection with a Leica DMI-6000B microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal unit. A 488-nm laser was used for GFP excitation and an Andor iXon Ultra DU888 EMCCD camera for signal detection.Onset of LLPS was determined by identifying the time point of foci formation, and the number of initial foci per cell in the corresponding frames were then counted using the morphological component detection function of Mathematica (Wolfram Research). The data was plotted and analyzed with GraphPad Prism using unpaired t-tests.Estimation of nuclear GFP-TDP43 levels in stable cell linesStable HEK-293T GFP-TDP43 CTD variant cell lines (see Experimental Model and Subject Details) were seeded into eight-well ibidi µ-slides (3 × 104 cells/well), allowed to adhere overnight and imaged live in L15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C using a Leica SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 488-nm laser, ×63 glycerol objective (NA 1.3) and a temperature-controlled incubation chamber (Life Imaging Services) set to 37 °C. To convert fluorescence intensities into estimates of nuclear TDP43 concentrations, the microscopy setup was calibrated with a titration series of 1, 2, 5, and 10 µM GFP solutions in L15 medium. See Supplementary Fig. 8d for calibration curve.Purification of recombinant TDP43The indicated TDP43 variants were appended with cleavable N-terminal His14-SUMO and C-terminal TEV-mCherry tags (Supplementary Table 2) and expressed in E.coli Express cells (New England Biolabs) at 20 °C in a 5-liter BioFlo110 bioreactor (New Brunswick) for 4 h after induction with 50 µM IPTG. Prior to harvesting, 1 mM PMSF and 10 mM EDTA were added to the cultures. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in IMAC buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1000 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. During thawing, 40 mM imidazole, 5 mM DTT and SigmaFast protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich) were added. To facilitate lysis, cells were sonicated on ice. Lysates were cleared by ultra-centrifugation and TDP43 variants purified over Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Gold Bio). Proteins were eluted in IMAC buffer adjusted to 400 mM imidazole and N-terminal tags cleaved-off by addition of SUMO protease. The eluates were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in GF buffer (40 mM HEPES pH7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). Purified TDP43 variants were concentrated using Amicon Ultracel 3 K filters (Millipore).In vitro TDP43 phase separation assaysPurified, full-length TDP43-TEV-mCherry variants were diluted to the indicated concentrations and adjusted to physiological conditions (20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). Where indicated, 10% 1,6-hexandediol (Sigma–Aldrich) or varying amounts of RNA extracted from 293 T cells using the Trizol reagent (Ambion) were additionally included. Phase separation was triggered by addition of 0.03 mg/ml TEV protease and monitored either by (i) measuring absorbance at 430 nm over time on a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek), (ii) imaging 30 min after TEV protease addition using a Leica SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a ×10 dry objective (NA 0.3) in transmitted light mode or (iii) on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel after 2 h of incubation and spinning the samples at max. speed in an Eppendorf table-top microfuge for 30 min. All assays were performed at room temperature.Splicing reporter assaysHEK293T TDP43 knock-out cells were seeded into standard P6 tissue culture plates (at 4 × 105 cells/well), allowed to adhere overnight and transfected with the indicated splicing reporter constructs (1 µg/well) using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). Each reporter comprised–expressed from a bidirectional promoter–the splicing module shown in Fig. 7a and a full-length TDP43 variant fused to an N-terminal BFP tag. Twenty four hour after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization for flow cytometry or using Trizol reagent (Ambion) for RNA extraction.All flow cytometry-based splicing assays were analyzed with a Sony SH800 flow cytometer. Instruments parameter settings were adjusted following the compensation guidelines using cells either expressing BFP, GFP, or mCherry, respectively. Data for at least 40,000 BFP-positive single cells per TDP43 variant were collected and analyzed with custom pipelines available on Github (https://github.com/RohatgiLab/TDP43-analysis) to calculate and plot the mCherry/GFP fluorescence intensity ratio and BFP levels on a single-cell level. Gate boundaries are specified in the code and a graphical representation of the applied gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.To validate and corroborate the flow cytometry-based splicing measurements, total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, transcribed into cDNA using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by analytical RT-PCR using the GoTaq Green kit (Promega) with primers 1171 and 1174 (see Supplementary Table 1). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5–2% agarose gels and documented with an AlphaImager EC system (Alpha Innotech).Splicing assay for endogenous TDP43 target RNAsTo test for splicing defects in the indicated endogenous TDP43 targets, total RNA was first extracted from >1.0 × 106 cells using Trizol reagent (Ambion) following the manufacturer’s instructions, then transcribed into cDNA using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad) and subsequently analyzed using the GoTaq Green kit (Promega) for analytical RT-PCRs with the primers specified in Supplementary Table 1. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5–2% agarose gels and documented with an AlphaImager EC system (Alpha Innotech).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6814767.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Nanofluidic Proteomic Immunoassay","text":"Nanofluidic Proteomic Immunoassay\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

The patterns of reactivity with 53,019 citrullinated peptides and 49,211 carbamylated peptides and the potential of the mAb to promote osteoclastogenesis were investigated.\n\nMaterials and MethodsCell isolation, assays, and culturesPlasma cells were obtained from the synovial fluid of a patient with anti‐CCP–positive RA, and antibody‐secreting cells were isolated from synovial fluid mononuclear cells using the fluorescent foci method. In addition, single citrulline‐specific B cells were sorted by flow cytometry from the peripheral blood of other RA patients, using an antigen‐tetramer system. Further details on the synovial fluid and serum samples obtained from RA patients and the methods used for plasma cell isolation, blood‐derived memory B cell tetramer isolation, Ig gene sequence analysis, cloning of Ig genes, generation of germline‐reverted antibodies, expression and purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, ACPA peptide array, PTM peptide enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in solution citrullination ELISA, immunoprecipitation and osteoclast cultures, and in vitro bone erosion assay are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods (available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40699/abstract).Peptide ELISAPeptide ELISAs were performed as previously described 20, with some minor modifications. The ELISAs assessed binding to both citrulline‐containing and arginine (Arg)–containing peptides, including filaggrin, α‐enolase, vimentin, fibrinogen, and histones H414–34, H431–50, and H31–30. All peptides assessed by ELISA are described in further detail in Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40699/abstract. The mAb were added to the wells at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, which was diluted by a factor of 2 down to 0.15 ng/ml. All reactive samples were analyzed in at least 3 independent experiments.Full‐length protein ELISAFor the full‐length protein ELISA, 10 μg/ml of fibrinogen (isolated from human plasma [Sigma]), recombinant vimentin (InVent), and histone H4 (in‐house produced) were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and coated on Nunc Maxisorp 96‐well plates. The plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS and thereafter incubated for 3 hours at 37°C with citrullination buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mU/ml human peptidylarginine deiminase 2 [hPAD2; Modiquest]) or buffer control, followed by incubation with ACPAs at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, which was diluted by a factor of 2 down to 0.15 ng/ml. Sequential incubation was carried out with secondary Fc‐specific, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti‐human IgG (Sigma) or biotin‐conjugated human IgG1‐Fc (Invitrogen) plus HRP‐conjugated streptavidin (Dako). This was followed by development with SeramunBlau fast TMB (Seramun Diagnostica), and the results were read with Spectra Fluor (Tecan).Extracellular matrix peptide microarrayPeptides (16 amino acids in length) that covered all arginine and lysine sites of 1,610 extracellular matrix proteins and RA‐related proteins 21, 22, 23 were synthesized in situ (Roche NimbleGen) as previously described 24. Citrulline (arginine) and homocitrulline (lysine) variants were synthesized, resulting in 53,019 citrullinated peptides and 49,211 carbamylated peptides, along with cognate unmodified peptides (n = 70,535), yielding a total of 172,765 unique peptides. The mAb were diluted to a concentration of 1 μg/ml (except mAb 1325:07E07, which was diluted to 0.55 μg/ml), while synovial fluid and serum samples were diluted 1/100.Scanning for citrulline and homocitrulline reactivity with each mAb was performed at a resolution of 2 μm, using a NimbleGen MS200 Scanner (Roche NimbleGen). The median fluorescence intensities were calculated based on a peptide signal intensity variation (spot size) of 25 pixels. The cutoff value for positive signals was determined as 5 times the fluorescence intensity of the 98th percentile of values for a set of non‐ACPA mAb.Western blottingFor Western blot analyses, full‐length proteins (same as those assessed by the full‐length protein ELISA) were solubilized in 8M urea at 1 mg/ml, and 10 μg was electrophoresed on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, followed by blotting to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Thereafter, the blots were incubated overnight at 37°C in citrullination buffer with 150 mU/ml hPAD2 (Modiquest) or with buffer control, followed by incubation with ACPAs at 5 μg/ml and sequential incubation with the same secondary antibody as that used for the full‐length protein ELISA. Visualization was performed using Amersham Hyperfilm.Sequence logo visualization of the consensus peptide sequencesThe 4 flanking amino acids from each posttranslational residue were analyzed using the WebLogo application ( http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/), which allowed us to generate the consensus sequences of the surrounding amino acids.Statistical analysisDifferences in the number of mutations and third complementarity‐determining region (CDR3) characteristics between ACPAs and non‐ACPAs were determined by Mann‐Whitney nonparametric test. For in vitro experiments, statistically significant differences were calculated using one‐way Kruskal‐Wallis test followed by Dunn's test for multiple comparisons. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant. GraphPad Prism (version 7.0c) was utilized to calculate and visualize the statistical data.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6563427.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Cloud-point PEG Glass Surfaces for Imaging of Immobilized Single Molecules by Totalinternal-reflection Microscopy","text":"Cloud-point PEG Glass Surfaces for Imaging of Immobilized Single Molecules by Totalinternal-reflection Microscopy\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Piranha preparation and treatment to clean cover glassesNote: Be very careful as the Piranha solution used in this step is extremely corrosive. Follow your institution’s safety regulations. We recommend, at least, wearing a lab coat, a full-length rubber apron coat, long-sleeve butyl gloves, a full-face splash shield, and working under a chemical fume hood free of flammable organic chemicals. Use PYREX glassware for preparation of Piranha solutions (regular soda-lime glass beakers may crack upon heating when Pirahna solutions are prepared).1.  Place 12 coverslips into ceramic rack using flat-tip tweezers.2.  In a designated chemical fume hood, place two clean 250~ml PYREX beakers (beaker 1 and 2) in two separate crystallization dishes. The dishes serve as secondary containers to ensure safety.3.  Very carefully add 1 part (50ml) of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) to beaker 1, followed by 3 parts ( ^.150ml) of concentrated sulfuric acid (H_2S O_4) . Gently stir to mix the solution with a clean glass rod. The solution will immediately form bubbles and heat up to 100^°C .4.  Using forceps, very carefully transfer the rack with the coverslips into beaker 1 and incubate for 30 min. To ensure safety, leave a note indicating that Piranha is in use.5.  Repeat Piranha treatment one more time with a fresh Piranha solution in beaker 2.6.  Transfer the coverslips from beaker 2 into a Nalgene 125~ml polypropylene jar filled with double-distilled water. Dispose of piranha waste according to your institution’s regulations. Rinse the coverslips copiously with double-distilled water until pH stabilizes (verified by pH paper). The cleaned coverslips can be stored in double-distilled water without noticeable changes in reactivity and fluorescent background for at least 1 month.7.  Quality control. a.  Surface hydrophilicity. Piranha-treated coverslips become uniformly hydrophilic, which can be qualitatively verified by dipping a coverslip in water using flat-end tweezers, taking it out vertically, and observing water slowly receding as a uniform sheet, and forming Young’s rings before drying out. In contrast, untreated coverslips form patches of water when dipped into and taken out of waterb.  Fluorescent background. After Piranha treatment, blow-dry a coverslip with pressurized pure nitrogen (see step C12) and place it onto a total-internal-reflection microscope. One should observe essentially no fluorescent spots <3 identifiable ‘spots’ per 100×100 micron area) under typical single-molecule imaging conditions (excitation with 532 and 640n m sources at density 0.5k W/c m^2 , imaging in 580/60 nm and 670/45 nm optical bands, sampling rate 2.5H z ).B.  Mild KOH etching to maximize the density of silanol groups on the glass surface (Iler, 1979) 8.  Transfer the Piranha-treated coverslips from water to a clean 250ml polypropylene jar containing 125ml of 0.5 M KOH, then sonicate for 1 h in a bath sonicator.a.  Be sure that the water level is up to the marked operating level, and is about level with the solution inside the jar.b.  Ensure that the temperature does not exceed 40~^°C by supplying ice ( 100200 g. by estimation) at t=0 and t=30 min during sonication. Otherwise the bath will heat up, which accelerates etching of the coverslips and creates micron-size pits in the glass surfaces.c.  Transfer the coverslips back into the polypropylene jar containing water and copiously rinse the coverslips with double-distilled water until  p H stabilizes, as verified by pH paper.C.  Silanization to create amine groups on glass surfaceNote: In this step, the glass surface is functionalized with amine groups by incubating in a solution of APTES. Although APTES is one the best studied silanization agents, there is currently no consensus on the best method to cost-effectively create molecularly homogenous, reactive, stable APTES films. The parameter space for APTES deposition conditions is vast, as the quality of films has been shown to depend on the substrate (e.g. glass, silica, or oxidized silicon), surface cleaning method, deposition phase (e.g. liquid or vapor), water content of the solvent and the surface, concentration of APTES, temperature, incubation times, and annealing conditions for references, see Kim et al. (2009). Our procedure is based on the simple technique introduced to the single-molecule imaging field by Ha and colleagues (Ha et al., 2002). In our hands, more sophisticated deposition methods did not create APTES surfaces superior to the ones prepared per Ha et al. (2002).9.  Under a fume hood, prepare three clean 125ml polypropylene jars (maximal capacity of 170ml ) containing 125ml acetone.10. Connect a non-coring needle to a 10 cc gas-tight glass syringe via a PTFE valve. Close the PTFE valve. Insert the needle through the septum of the APTES bottle and ensure that the needle orifice is below the surface of the APTES. Create slight positive pressure inside the APTES sealed bottle using a nitrogen line and a second non-coring needle. Open the PTFE valve. Withdraw 3.75ml of APTES with the syringe and closethe PTFE valve. Remove the needle from the bottle, open the PTFE valve, and add the APTES into the 125ml of acetone in one of the jars. Gently stir to prepare 3% APTES.11. Using forceps, remove the rack with coverslips from double-distilled water, and dip the rack successively into the two 125ml polypropylene jars containing acetone, spending 10 sec in each jar with gentle agitation. Then transfer immediately into the freshly prepared 3% APTES solution. Do not allow acetone to dry between transfers. Place the APTES container on a horizontal platform shaker and incubate for 1~h~ .Note: Immediately after use, during silanization, rinse the syringe, the syringe needles, and the PTFE valve sequentially with acetone and double-distilled water, and then blow with dry nitrogen. Also, during silanization, prepare PEG solutions (steps D14-15).12. After silanization, wash the coverslips with acetone by dipping the rack in the two jars containing acetone (see step C11) in reverse order and place the rack back into doubledistilled water. Copiously rinse with double-distilled water. Do not let the coverslips spend more than 5 min in water. Blow the coverslips dry one-by-one with nitrogen. To that end, hold a coverslip on its corner with the flat-end tweezers, and direct the nitrogen gas flow across the surface of the coverslip towards the corner held by the tweezers. When dry, place the coverslip on a piece of Parafilm positioned on a flat, clean surface. Mark the upper surface of the coverslip by scoring the upper-left corner with a diamond scriber. The coverslips are now ready for PEGylation. Notes:a.  We usually carry out PEGylation in a clean environment (e.g., a positive-pressure HEPA-filtered room), but we also have had success in a regular environment if PEGylation was carried out immediately after treatment by APTES. We typically do not store amine-treated coverslips.b.  Many APTES deposition protocols include a high-temperature curing step following silanization, meant to form stable covalent bonds between physisorbed APTES molecules (Plueddemann, 1982). However, on the molecular scale, curing may lead to lateral rearrangement of APTES molecules and create islands of unmodified glass (Kim et al., 2009). In our hands, curing offered no additional improvement in surface quality in terms of preventing non-specific adsorption of biomolecules.13. Quality control: Concentration of amine groups. You can measure the concentration of amine groups on coverslip surfaces using TRIONE ninhydrin reagent. To that end, crush one coverslip by placing it into a 50ml Falcon tube and centrifuging at 2,000× g in a swing-bucket centrifuge for 1 min. Then fill the tube with 1ml of the ninhydrin reagent and follow the manufacturer’s protocol to spectrophotometrically quantify the average density of amine groups on the coverslip surface (for 24×40~m m coverslips, with the thickness of 0.15~m m , the total surface area is 1,940 m m^2) ). Using standard dilutions of APTES as create a calibration curve, we typically get 3 amine groups per n m^2 .D.  Treatment of amine-glass surfaces with NHS-PEG at cloud-point conditions Notes:a.  The procedure builds upon the method introduced by Ha et al. (2002), with modifications to maximize the density of PEG molecules, and to block and neutralize positively charged amine groups after PEG deposition (section E). Thus, amine-treated coverslips are coupled to succinimidyl-PEG at pH 9.0 in a bicarbonate buffer containing 0.45 M kappa_2S O_4 , at 10.0 % NHS-PEG (w/v). The high salt and the high PEG concentration bring the PEG solution just below its ‘cloud point’, which maximizes the density of the PEG layer on the surface (Kingshott et al., 2002).b.  NHS group hydrolyzes in aqueous buffers, which makes NHS-PEG non-reactive. The lifetime of the NHS group is between a few seconds and a few minutes, depending on the nature of the NHS-PEG linker, pH, and temperature (Hermanson, 2008). For example, we found that NHS-SVA hydrolyses with a half-life of 5 min at p Hvartheta.O at room temperature, which is a good compromise between the reactivity of the NHS group and the reactive species lifetime. Thus, our protocol minimizes the time the reactive NHS-SVA species spends at p H=9.0 prior to addition to the amine-glass surface. Specifically, we initially dissolve dry PEG-SVA at p H6.0_z , at which the NHS group remains unhydrolyzed for at least 1 h. Then, immediately before addition of the PEG solution to the glass surface, we bring the pH up to 9.0. If you are using a nonSVA linker, you have to optimize the pH of the reaction to achieve the NHS lifetime of ~5 min.c.  The lifetime of the reactive NHS group can be measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the kinetics of accumulation of free NHS upon hydrolysis free NHS strongly adsorbs at 260 nm (Miron, 1982). We also highly recommend measuring the percentage of reactive PEG-NHS in new batches of purchased PEG reagents. We have had cases in which completely hydrolyzed, non-reactive PEGs had been shipped by major suppliers.14. This step is best done during the APTES incubation at step C11. Take out 6 single-use aliquots of dry mPEG-SVA from storage at -80~^°C . Each aliquot should be about 5:mg , which is sufficient to treat two coverslips. The mass of dry mPEG-SVA in the 6 aliquots should have been pre-written on each tube with 0.1 mg accuracy prior to storage at - 80^°C (e.g., 4.9, 5.0, 5,1, 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1 mg for 6 tubes). In addition, take out 1-2m g of biotin-PEG-SVA from storage. Let all tubes warm up to room temperature.15. This step is best done during the APTES incubation at step C11. Calculate the volume of 0.5 M K2SO4 solution to add to each mPEG-SVA tube by multiplying the aliquot mass by 8 (e.g., the tube containing 4.9~m g will require 4.9×8=39.2~ul of K_2S O_4 solution) and record all volumes in a notebook. Sum up all the volumes, to get the minimal volume of 0.5 M K_2S O_4 required to make six PEG solutions e.g., for 6 tubes containing 4.9, 5.0, 5,1, 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1 mg mPEG-SVA one needs (4.9+5.0+5.1+4.9+5.0+5.1)×8=240 μl of K_2S O_4 . Based on the calculated minimal volume, prepare sufficient amount of 0.5% biotin-PEG-SVA solution in 0.5 M K_2S O_4 (e.g., dissolve 1.3m g of biotin-PEG-SVA with 260 ~sharp~Gamma0.5GammaM K_2SO_4) . Pipet the pre-calculated volumes of the 0.5% biotin-PEG-SVA solution into each of the 6 mPEG-SVA aliquots (e. g. add 39.2~ul to the 4.9 mg tube, and so on), vortex for 10 sec, and briefly spin with a tabletop centrifuge. Each tube now should have a clear solution and a small ^5u1 in volume) pellet of PEG on the bottom.Note: PEG precipitation is expected, because the PEG solution is currently at 11.6% concentration (w/v), which is above its ‘cloud point’ (10%w/v) .The tubes can remain at room temperature for at least 1 h without appreciable hydrolysis of the NHS group while the coverslips are being treated with APTES and laid out for PEGylation.16. With all APTES-treated coverslips laid out for PEGylation, set up the PEGylation reactions using one PEG-NHS aliquot at a time. To that end, add 1/8 of 1 M NaHCO3 (p H9.0) to the PEG solution in K_2S O_4 (e.g. add 4.9ul of NaHCO3 to a tube that originally contained a 4.9 mg mPEG-SVA aliquot, and now contains 39.2~ul of the biotin-PEGSVA solution), quickly mix by pipetting up and down, and deposit the whole solution in the center of a dry APTES-treated coverslip. Cover the drop with another coverslip carefully, making sure that the scored surfaces of both coverslips face towards the PEG solution, and avoiding formation of bubbles (by practicing). Repeat for the rest five pairs of coverslip and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Note: The PEG solution appears clear after addition of NaHCO3, because the total PEG concentration is now just below the ‘cloud point’. We noticed that additional coating of coverslips with a fresh solution of PEG does not improve the quality of surfaces (in terms of non-specific adsorption of biomolecules).17. Carefully separate the coverslip pairs using tweezers and place individual coverslips back into the ceramic rack in the double-distilled water. Rinse extensively with water until there is no more foaming of the solution.Quality control: Density of PEG molecules. You can estimate the packing density of the PEG molecules on the glass surface by depositing fluorescein-PEG-NHS in the same conditions as described above, and measuring the absorbance at 494 nm using a highsensitivity double-beam spectrophotometer (e.g., Perkin Elmer Lambda 35). The molecules density =(O D_494/e). xtinction coefficient) × 6.02× 10^23 m o l^-1, area. By this estimation, the average packing density should be consistent with the radius of gyration of a M_w=5,000 PEG molecule at cloud point R=2.8n m (Dalsin et al., 2005).# E.  Blocking of unreacted amines with acetyl groupsNote: Due to the bulkiness of PEG molecules, only a fraction of amine groups on the surface reacts with NHS-PEG. As a result, the remaining amines contribute to non-specific adsorption of negatively charged molecules, such as DNA, which is problematic in buffers of low ionic strengths. Thus, we cap the unreacted amines with NHS-acetate to convert them to neutral, stable amides.18. Blow-dry 12 PEGylated coverslips as described in step C12. Place dry coverslips on Parafilm, with the PEGylated surface facing up.19. Immediately prior to use, dissolve 3 mg of sulfo-NHS-acetate in 300~ul of 0.1 M NaHCO3 (p H9.0) , deposit 50~ul drops of the solution onto the 6 PEG coverslips, and cover with the remaining 6 coverslips, with the PEGylated surface facing the solution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Rinse coverslips with double-distilled water, blow-dry, and store dry at -80~^°C .F.  Testing fluorescent background of PEGylated surfaces and non-specific absorption of biomoleculesNote: The following protocol is for a rapid test of non-specific ‘stickiness’ of the surface to fluorescently labeled biomolecules. However, this test does not address the biological activity of surface-immobilized molecules (for instance, the activity of a transcription factor on a surface-immobilized DNA). Thus, the most relevant test of surface quality is a biochemical assay of the activity of surface-bound biomolecule, performed side-by-side with a positive control in which the activity of the same amount of biomolecules is measured in solution-based conditions (Revyakin et al., 2012).20. Create 5 open wells on a coverslip using 1 mm-wide strips of double-sided tape (by simply sticking 6 strips on to the modified side), and place the coverslip on an objectivetype TIRF microscope. The 5 wells allow testing of 5 different biomolecules.21. Deposit a 5~ul drop of PBST into a well, turn on the excitation laser, and focus the microscope onto the surface. Acquire a movie to measure the fluorescent background on the surface, under single-molecule imaging conditions (e.g., excitation with 532 and 640 nm sources at density 0.5k W/c m^2 , imaging in 580/60 nm and 670/45 nm optical bands, sampling rate 2.5H z ). In our hands, silanization and PEGylation increase the number of fluorescent background spots 3 fold in comparison to Piranha-treated glass (i.e., an increase from 3 spots to 10 spots per 100×100~um field of view), which is an acceptable level of background for most single-molecule imaging experiments. Allow the background spots to photobleach.22. Prepare a 10 nM solution of the fluorescently labeled test protein in PBST, and deposit 20~ul of the solution on top of the 5ul PBST drop already in the well. Acquire a movie to quantify the non-specific adsorption of the molecule to the surface. For simplicity, in this test we do not supply oxygen scavenger to the solution of test protein. Thus, to avoid immediate photobleaching upon sticking of a molecule to the surface (which will lead to over-estimation of surface quality) use minimal laser power (30100 W/c m^2) and fluorescent labels that photobleach in >5 seconds in the absence of oxygen scavengers (e.g., Cy3 and Atto633). For a good-quality surface, we typically observe a ‘cloud’ of 10 nM biomolecules rapidly diffusing in the bulk solution (at 2.5 H z acquisition rate), and 10 single-molecule limited spots in any given movie frame ( 100×100 um field of view). No additional accumulation of spots should be observed within 10 m i n (with the excitation light switched off, and then turned back on again), indicating that non-specific adsorption is rare and reversible. Repeat the test with other biomolecules of interest using the remaining 4 wells.# Recipes1.  0.5 M KOH (per liter) 28 g KOH Note: Solution can be re-used.2.  0.5 M K2SO4 (pH 6.0) (per liter) 174 g K2SO4 Note: Store at room temperature.

Genotypes of each strain are provided in S1 Table. Strains containing a chromosomal his3AI-[Δ1]-marked Ty1 element (Ty1his3AI-3114) were described previously [19, 85]. Recombination of the his3AI-[Δ1] allele with the his3Δ1 allele present in strain BY4741 derivatives does not result in a functional HIS3 allele [36]. Strains containing Mediator subunit gene deletions were constructed via lithium acetate transformation with a KanMX allele as described [86, 87].A chromosomal Ty1kanMXAI element was introduced into strain BY4741 by inducing the expression of a Ty1kanMXAI element fused to the GAL1 promoter on a yeast URA3-marked 2μ vector (plasmid pGTy1kanMXAI [39]), as described previously [19]. Briefly, a transformant of strain BY4741 harboring plasmid pGTy1kanMXAI was grown on SC-URA 2% glucose 2% raffinose agar at 20°C. Twenty single colonies were picked and struck for single colonies on SC-URA 2% glucose and grown at 30°C. A single Ura+ colony harboring cells that had maintained the pGTy1kanMXAI plasmid throughout galactose-induction was picked from each streak and struck for single colonies on YPD and grown at 30°C. A single colony was picked from each YPD streak and used to make a 1 cm2 patch on YPD at 30°C. Each patch was replicated to a fresh YPD agar and grown for three days at 20°C, and then replicated to YPD agar containing 200 μg/ml G418 and grown at 30°C for three days. Strains harboring a chromosomal Ty1kanMXAI element were identified by the appearance of G418R papillae. A strain with a representative number of G418R papillae, JC6464, was chosen for further analysis. A med15Δ:URA3 derivative of strain JC6464 was constructed by PCR-mediated gene disruption.Plasmid Ycp50-Ty1his3AI-[Δ1] is a URA3-CEN plasmid containing a Ty1his3AI-[Δ1] element, constructed by replacing the ClaI fragment containing the his3AI allele in pBDG633 with a ClaI fragment containing his3AI-[Δ1] and kindly provided by Dr. David Garfinkel [88]. Plasmid pBJC1250 is a LEU2- CEN vector containing a Ty1his3AI-[Δ1] element wherein the U3 region of the 5′ LTR was replaced with a TEF1 promoter (herein referred to as PTEF1-Ty1his3AI; see Fig 5). Plasmid pBJC80, herein referred to as pGTy1ΔPOL, has been described previously [69].Retrotransposition frequency assayTy1 retromobility was determined as previously described [19]. Individual colonies from strains were grown in triplicate in YPD broth at 30°C overnight. Each culture was then diluted in quadruplicate by a factor of 1000 in YPD broth and grown at 20°C to an optical density beyond log growth phase. 1μL of a 1:1000 dilution of each of the resulting 12 cultures was plated on YPD agar to provide an accurate representation of the cell density. In parallel, 100μL to 1mL of each culture was plated on SC-HIS agar. All plates were grown at 30°C for 3–4 days. Mobility frequency was calculated as a ratio of the number of His+ colony forming units to the number of colony forming units in each culture as represented by the number of colonies growing on YPD agar. For strains for which no His+ prototrophs were observed, mobility was reported as an upper limit equal to the ratio of (1/the total number of colony forming units in all three biological replicates).For strains containing a plasmid Ty1his3AI element, the above protocol was modified such that cultures were grown in their respective selective media (SC-URA or SC-LEU with 2% glucose) at 30°C until confluent, diluted 1:1000 and grown at 20°C in YPD until confluent, and plated on their respective dropout media (SC-URA or SC-LEU with 2% glucose) as well as the corresponding media lacking histidine (SC-URA-HIS or SC-LEU-HIS with 2% glucose).For strains containing a chromosomal Ty1kanMXAI element and plasmid pBJC1250 containing the PTEF1-Ty1his3AI element, the above protocol was modified such that cultures were grown in SC-LEU 2% glucose at 30°C overnight. Cultures were diluted 1:1000 into YPD broth and separated into 12 independent cultures that were grown for three days at 20°C. A 1:1000 dilution of each culture was plated on YPD agar to determine the number of colony forming units in each culture, and aliquots of each culture were plated on YPD agar containing 200 μg/ml G418 to determine the number of G418R colony forming units per culture, and SC-HIS 2% glucose to determine the number of His+ colony forming units per culture.RNA purificationCells were grown in YPD broth at 20°C to mid-log phase. Total cellular RNA was extracted using a hot phenol/chloroform extraction protocol [89]. PolyA+ RNA was purified from 250μg to 1mg of total cellular RNA using the Magnetic mRNA Isolation Kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s protocol.Northern blotA 20μg aliquot of total cellular RNA was separated on a 1% Seakem GTG agarose gel as previously described [90]. Three to six μg of poly A+ RNA was separated on an 0.8% Seakem GTG agarose gel as previously described [90]. Separated RNA was transferred to a Hybond XL membrane (GE Healthcare) using a gradient of 6X SSC to 10X SSC overnight at room temperature. Synthesis of 32P-labeled RNA riboprobes was carried out in vitro using SP6 or T7 polymerase (New England Biolabs). Membranes were incubated with probes in NorthernMax PreHyb Buffer (Ambion) at 65°C overnight. Images were scanned using a Typhoon 9400 scanner, and quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Western blotCultures were grown at 20°C in YPD for one cell doubling (OD600 0.3 to OD600 0.6) after dilution from overnight cultures grown at 30°C. Protein was extracted from total cell lysates as previously described [91] and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. When resolving p18- and p22-Gag, a 15% SDS-PAGE gel was used. Protein was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked in a 5% nonfat milk solution dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% TWEEN 20. Membranes were then incubated in 0.5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% TWEEN 20 with a 1:7500 dilution of affinity-purified anti-VLP antisera [53] to detect Gag, a 1:5000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody specific to p18-Gag (a gift from David Garfinkel, described in [24]), a 1:7500 dilution of anti GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), or a 1:5000 dilution of anti actin monoclonal antibody (Abcam). Med17-myc was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of a monoclonal antibody to c-myc (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Millipore). Following terminal washes, membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and exposed to film (Kodak). Antibody was stripped from membranes as described previously [92]. Images were developed on film using a Model SRX-101A Medical Scanner (Konica Minolta) and scanned using a Cannon MP480 scanner. Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ (NIH). Quantification was performed using film exposed for different durations to ensure that measurements were done within the linear response range.Southern blotCultures were grown past log growth phase at 20°C in YPD broth. Total genomic DNA was isolated as previously described [15, 93], and digested with Sph I endonuclease. Digested genomic DNA was then fractionated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% GTG agarose gel and subjected to Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled riboprobe specific for POL as described previously [15, 37].cDNA synthesis and estimation of pGTy1ΔPOL expressionPolyadenylated RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix). 100ng of polyA+ mRNA was used per reaction, as were 0.5μM concentration each of primers specific to the ΔPOL region of pGTy1ΔPOL (5′-CCACCCATAATGTAATAGATCTATCGATTCTAGAC-3′) and to ACT1 (5′-ATCGTCCCAGTTGGTGACAATACC-3′). Reactions were performed according to manufacturer protocols, and run at 44°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation at 92°C for 10 minutes. For comparison of levels of full-length Ty1 and Ty1i transcripts generated from pGTy1ΔPOL (Fig 6), cDNA was PCR amplified using primers binding 250 bp upstream of the Ty1i TSS (5′-GATTCATCCTCAGCGGACTCTG-3′), or 250 bp downstream of Ty1i TSS (5′-AGAAGAATGATTCTCGCAGC-3′), and the ΔPOL region of the element (5′-CCACCCATAATGTAATAGATCTATCGATTCTAGAC-3′). PCR product was isolated at different cycle numbers and compared with amplification of ACT1 (forward primer: 5′-GGTTCTGGTATGTGTAAAGCCGGT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ATCGTCCCAGTTGGTGACAATACC-3′) to control for relative cDNA abundance. A control set of PCR amplifications was performed using genomic DNA prepared from the same strain.Expression of pGTy1ΔPOL relative to expression of ACT1 was estimated as follows: Amplification of ACT1 cDNA was observed at 5–6 fewer cycles than the average amplification for Ty1 and Ty1i, whereas amplification of gDNA was about equal to this average (Fig 6B), thus indicating conservatively a 32-fold greater amount of ACT1 transcript. The amplicon for ACT1 is about 200 bp, while the amplicons for Ty1ΔPOL and Ty1iΔPOL are each about 3 kb, and so an equal intensity for ACT1 and Ty1ΔPOL corresponds to about a 15-fold greater molar quantity of ACT1. Combining these ratios indicates that ACT1 transcript levels are approximately 450 times greater than those for Ty1ΔPOL.ChIP-seqFor analysis of Mediator occupancy at Ty1 elements (Fig 8), chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed using strains in which Mediator subunits Med15 or Med17 carried 13-myc epitope tags and which were engineered to allow Kin28 inactivation by the anchor away technique (S1 Table) [63]. For anchor away experiments, yeast were grown in YPD to an OD600 of 0.8. Rapamycin was then added to a concentration of 1 μg/mL (from a 1 mg/mL stock in ethanol stored at -20°C for not more than one month) and cultures allowed to grow one hr at 30°C prior to cross-linking. ChIP against epitope-tagged Mediator subunits was carried out as described previously [61], using 2 μg of anti-myc antibody (clone 9E10, Sigma) and protein G sepharose beads for capture (GE Healthcare). Library preparation for Illumina sequencing was performed using the NEBNext Ultra II library preparation kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s directions. Libraries were bar-coded using NEXTflex barcodes (BIOO Scientific) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health.Unfiltered paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to the S. cerevisiae reference genome (Saccer3) by using BWA [94]. Up to one mismatch was allowed for each aligned read; reads mapping to multiple locations were retained and randomly assigned. Because full-length Ty1 elements share sequences with 266 Ty1 delta elements (263 of which are <350 bp in length), some reads from the first ~350 bp of Ty1 elements will also be mapped to these elements. Duplicate reads were removed based on paired end information. Occupancy profiles for Ty1 elements were generated by averaging the signal of all 31 Ty1 elements; thus, behavior of individual elements cannot be assessed. The occupancy is plotted on the window from 2kb upstream of TSS to 2kb downstream of TES (Figs 5 and 6). In each Ty1 element ORF, from TSS+1kb to TES-1kb, the region is divided into 100 bins and the average occupancy of each bin was calculated. For the flanking regions, the occupancy was calculated for each base pair.Data depositionChIP-seq data has been deposited in Arrayexpress under accession number E-MTAB-5824.

Trap a floating bead near the bottom of glass surface by focused laser beam, start to record the bead movements at 200 frames per second and immediately attached the bead to the back end of the gliding cell through the avidin-biotin interaction. The cell pulls the bead from trap center of optical tweezers and finally stalls (Video 1). The recording should be continued at least 30 sec after the start of stall (Note 4). After recording, turn off the laser beam.12. Remove the tunnel chamber and objective lens, turn on the laser beam to the same power as the step C11 and measure the applied laser power of the parallel light, which was achieved by the removal of objective lens, with using a power meter.13.

At 5 sec, a flowing bead came from the right side and trapped at the beam. At 18 sec, a gliding cell was moved into the field by stage handling. At 27 sec, the bead was attached to the gliding cell. The cell pulled the trapped bead and stalled from 33 sec to the end.()\n\n# Outline\n\n## Coating Polystyrene Beads with Avidin\nWarm polystyrene beads, coupling buffer, and PBS to room temperature (RT).\nCentrifuge 60ul polystyrene bead suspension at 2,000× g for 6 min at RT.\n## Prepare Bead Suspension\nDiscard supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 400ul of coupling buffer and centrifuge it at 2,000 xg for 6 min at RT.\nDiscard supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 160ul of coupling buffer.\n## Activate Beads with EDAC\nJust before use, dissolve 11.7 mg of EDAC in 50ul of coupling buffer, add 20ul of this solution to the suspension and incubate for 5 min at RT.\n## Avidin Binding\nDissolve 0.4~m g of avidin in 10~ul of coupling buffer to be 0.13~m M as the final concentration, add the avidin solution to the suspension and incubate it with gently end-over-end mixing for 3 h at RT.\n## Washing and Storage\nCentrifuge the suspension at 2,000× g for 6 min at RT, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 450ul of PBS.

To elucidate a motility mechanism, we need information about the structure of machinery, the flow of energy, and the mechanical characters including speed and force. Optical tweezers are a special method used for micromanipulations or force measurements in the piconewton range under microscopy, by which an object with a diffractive index different from the medium is trapped at the center of focused laser beam (Ashkin et al., 1986). This method has greatly contributed to clarifying the features of motility systems including myosin, dynein, and kinesin, and now an established method in the field of biophysics. Here, we provide a protocol on how to measure force generated by surface moving microorganisms, based on our studies (Miyata et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2016) for gliding mechanism of M. mobile the fastest gliding species in class Mollicutes. This is the first protocol for force measurement made using optical tweezers in bio-protocol.","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2127"}}

Product identity was confirmed by electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry in the positive mode. Expected mass (in Da) for TO1-Dtb: C40H55N6O7S+: 763.3847, obtained mass: 763.3855, and expected mass for TO3-Dtb: C42H57N6O7S+: 789.4003, obtained mass: 789.3999.Preparation of TO1-Dtb derivatized streptavidin agarose affinity resinIn all experiments, streptavidin agarose beads (Invitrogen) were used for batch purification in either 1.7 mL or 5 mL tubes, as required, and solutions containing the beads were mixed using a rotator. The beads (400 µL) were washed twice with 0.1 M NaOH and 0.05 M NaCl (Buffer A) as per the manufacturer's protocol and three times with 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl (Buffer B). TO1-Dtb was added (22.5 nmol) in 400 µL Buffer B and incubated with the washed beads for 15 min at RT. The beads were then washed once with 400 µL Buffer B to remove any unbound dye.Yeast strain and extract preparationThe yeast U1M strain was prepared from the BJ2168 derivative yAAH0441 (Mat a, prc1-407, prb1-1122, pep4-3, leu2, trp1, ura3-52, his3::loxP gal2 snr19::loxP [pMKU1-7 URA CEN]), a kind gift of Dr. Magda Konarska. The U1M gene along with 500 bp of upstream and 723 bp of downstream genomic DNA sequence was constructed by Genewiz, subcloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pRS413 plasmid (HIS3 CEN6), and sequenced. The U1M plasmid was then transformed into yAAH0441. Transformants were selected on dropout media, and single colonies were streaked onto medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA, 1 mg/mL) to select for loss of the WT U1 URA3-marked plasmid. The presence of the U1-Mango gene and the absence of the WT allele in the resulting strain (yAAH1204) were confirmed by using PCR to amplify the U1 gene and DNA sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 2). A double-tagged strain containing both U1M and a SNAP-tagged Snp1 protein (yAAH1362) was created by homologous recombination to insert the SNAPf gene and a downstream hygromycin selection marker as previously described (Hoskins et al. 2011). Transformants were confirmed by PCR and by labeling of Snp1-SNAPf with fluorescent SNAP ligands. Yeast whole-cell extracts were prepared from strains yAAH1204 and yAAH1362 as previously described using the liquid N2 method and a ball mill (Hoskins et al. 2011).SNAP labeling of yeast whole-cell extractYeast whole-cell extracts (500 µL) were first fluorescently tagged with the SNAP-Surface 549 tag (NEB) by incubating the extracts with 1 U/µL Murine RNase inhibitor (NEB), Protease Inhibitors (cOmplete mini at the recommended concentration, EDTA Free, Sigma), 5 mM DTT together with 5 µM SNAP-Surface 549 tag in Buffer B at RT for 30 min.Pull-down of U1M-associated snRNPsYeast whole-cell extracts (500 µL of extract either with or without SNAP label) were added to 200 µL of TO1-Dtb saturated agarose beads and incubated at 4°C for 1 h in a rotator. The beads were washed twice each with 5 mL Buffer B for 15 min at 4°C. The beads were washed once more with buffer B at 30°C for 5 min. The snRNP was then eluted by the addition of 200 µL Buffer B supplemented with 20 mM biotin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 min. For visualizing the fluorescent labeled SNAPf tag, 100 µL of the biotin eluate was concentrated in a speed vac to 10 µL and loaded directly onto a 10% SDS PAGE gel. The gel was imaged using a Typhoon scanner using 532 nm excitation and 580 nm emission filter settings and with PMT kept at 1000 V. The remaining 100 µL of the biotin eluate was phenol extracted once, chloroform extracted twice, and ethanol precipitated using 2 µg glycogen. The pellet was resuspended in 5.1 µL of water and analyzed by RT-primer extension assay.RNA analysis by RT-primer extension and solution hybridizationEither 1 µL of the precipitated RNA or 1 µg of total RNA isolated from WT yeast extract was added to the corresponding 5′ [32P]-labeled primers (Supplemental Table 4) and the reverse transcription reaction was then carried out using the Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 45°C for 1 h. Reactions were then loaded onto an 8% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run at 500 V at RT. For solution hybridization, 5′ [32P]-labeled primers (Supplemental Table 4) were added directly to the precipitated RNAs and incubated for 15 min at RT prior to loading onto a 5% (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) native polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis at 4°C in 1× TBE at 350 V.Construction of the p6SRDM_T7 plasmidThe 6SRDM plasmid was created as previously described (Dolgosheina et al. 2014) but with point mutations corresponding to the R9-33 construct (Oviedo Ovando et al. 2014). The 6SRDM is flanked by a T7 promoter and lac operator at its 5′ end and an intrinsic terminator at its 3′ end and was cloned into the pEcoli-Cterm-6xHN (Clontech) plasmid between the SgrAI and ClaI sites. Refer to Supplemental Figure 5 for sequences.Expression of the 6SRDM RNA in E. coli and extract preparationThe 6SRDM RNA was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the p6SRDM_T7 plasmid (Supplemental Fig. 5). E. coli cells transformed with p6SRDM_T7 were grown overnight at 37°C in a shaking incubator in Luria-Bertani (LB) media containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin. A portion of the overnight culture (10 mL) was then used to inoculate 1 L of LB media containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a 4 L Erlenmeyer flask. The cells were then grown at 37°C in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm until the OD600 reached ∼1, at which point IPTG was added to a final concentration of 50 µM to induce 6SRDM RNA transcription. After 40 min of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3800g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in 20 mL native extract buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The resuspended cells were then lysed by two passages through a French press prechilled to 4°C and at 1000 psi. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris to yield native extract (NE). This extract was then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C.Purification of 6S RNARDM RNP complexesFor the purification of 6SRDM associated RNPs, 3.8 mL of E. coli native extract, was made up to 5 mL final volume by the addition of 1 mL of 5× Buffer B and supplemented with final concentrations of Heparin at 75 µg/mL and DTT at 0.75 mM. This solution was mixed with the TO1-Dtb derivatized agarose beads for 15 min while incubating at RT. The beads were washed twice with WB (15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 75 µg/mL Heparin and 0.75 mM DTT) at RT for 2 min each prior to elution with 400 µL of WB containing 20 mM free biotin at 37°C for 20 min (called Biotin Eluate).6SRDM RNP complex fractionation by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)This biotin eluate (380 µL) was loaded onto a manually packed Superdex 200 Prep Grade (GE Healthcare) column (30 × 1 cm) and eluted with Buffer B using a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. Fractions (500 µL) were collected and TO1-Dtb fluorescence was measured using a Spectramax M5 fluorescent plate reader (Ex/Em 495/535 nm, PMT at Medium) reading from the bottom of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one).Mass spectrometry analysis of 6SRDM RNP complexes and commercial RNAPSamples were analyzed at the University of British Columbia Proteomics Core Facility. LC–MS/MS analysis used a quadrupole–time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Impact II; Bruker Daltonics) coupled to an Easy nano LC 1000 HPLC precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Analysis of mass spectrometry data was performed using MaxQuant 1.5.1.0. The peptide search was performed against a database comprised of the protein sequences from E. coli K12. Commercial holoenzyme was from Epicentre.Partial purification of eGFP-HEE. coli eGFP-HE was partially purified from E. coli strain RL1314 which was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Landick, UW Madison (Bratton et al. 2011). The partial purification was adapted from the protocol of Burgess and Jendrisak (1975). Briefly, 1 L of RL1314 E. coli cells at OD ∼1 were harvested and resuspended in 8 mL of 50 mM Tris pH 8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and 233 mM NaCl along with protease inhibitors (cOmplete mini at the recommended concentration, EDTA Free, Sigma) and lysed through a French press (prechilled to 4°C) at 1000 psi. The crude lysate was diluted with 8 mL of TGED Buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 5% v/v glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.2 M NaCl and was centrifuged at 12,000g for 45 min to remove cell debris. To this cleared lysate, 0.175 mL of 10% v/v Polymin P at pH 8 was added to 100 mL of the cleared lysate and stirred for 5 min, before pelleting at 4300g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was washed once for 10 min with 10 mL TGED + 0.5 M NaCl and repelleted at 4300g for 15 min. The washed pellet was once again resuspended in 10 mL TGED + 1 M NaCl and stirred for 10 min and the insoluble proteins were removed by spinning at 4300g for 15 min. The resulting material was precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate (35 g/100 mL) and resuspended in 500 µL dialysis buffer (TGED + 0.1 M NaCl but with 50% w/v glycerol) and was dialyzed overnight against 1 L of dialysis buffer. All the above steps were done either at 4°C or on ice.Two-color gel-imaging analysis of the Mango and eGFP-tagged 6S:RNAP complexIn vitro synthesized 6SM RNA (1 µM) was added to 2 µM TO3-Dtb and one-tenth of the reaction volume of the partially purified eGFP-HE in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT and 75 µg/mL heparin. This solution was then incubated at 37°C for 30 min to form bound complex. To induce pRNA synthesis-dependent 6SM release, 500 µM NTPs and 5 mM MgCl2 were then added and incubation continued at 37°C. Samples were loaded into a 5% (37.5:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide) native polyacrylamide gel using 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 90 mM KCl as both the gel and running buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out for 90 min at 4°C at 100 V. The gel was then imaged using a Typhoon Trio+ Variable Mode Imager (GE LifeSciences) using a 488 nm laser and 526 BP filter for eGFP-HE visualization and a 644 nm laser and 670 BP filter for imaging TO3-Dtb:6SM complex. PMT settings were kept at 1000 V and 600 V for eGFP and Mango/TO3-Dtb, respectively. Image data were analyzed and a composite image was made using ImageQuant TV v8.1.0.0 (GE LifeSciences).Two-photon spectrum and cross-correlation experiments sample conditionsThe two-photon spectrum of 6SM:TO3-Dtb was obtained by measuring fluorescence intensity in photon/s over a range of two-photon excitation wavelengths. The solution contained 1 µM in vitro transcribed 6SM, 1 µM TO3-Dtb, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT, and 75 µg/mL heparin. The wavelength was first set to 800 nm, and then tuned to higher wavelengths at a constant rate up to 900 nm. During this tuning, data were acquired in the red channel at a rate of 100 Hz.Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy was performed by adding increasing amounts of RNAP-eGFP extract to a fixed amount of 6SM and TO3-Dtb. The starting mixture (128 µL) contained 1 µM in vitro transcribed 6SM, 1 µM TO3-Dtb, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT, and 75 µg/mL heparin. To this was added 12.5 µL of partially purified E. coli eGFP-HE (see above), which was prediluted fivefold in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT, and 75 µg/mL heparin. The sample was mixed and cross-correlation spectroscopy was performed. This was repeated for five sequential 12.5 µL additions, and two final 62.5 µL additions of the prediluted eGFP-HE. The molecular brightness of the 6SM:TO3-Dtb alone was determined by correlation spectroscopy on the mixture prior to adding any eGFP-HE. The molecular brightness of eGFP-HE alone was determined by adding 12.5 µL to 128 µL water and performing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. A mixture containing 6SM in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT, and 75 µg/mL heparin, without TO3-Dtb, was measured and showed no fluorescence above background.Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy was performed on an ISS Alba microscope controlled using ISS Vista Vision 4.0 Software. Two-photon laser excitation was achieved using a Titanium Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Tsunami) mode locked at a median wavelength of 840 nm and a laser power of 45 mW unless otherwise specified. Light was collected using two PerkinElmer SPCM-ARQ Avalanche Photodiodes. Laser light was filtered using a 780 nm short pass filter (Semrock) and split using a 561-nm-long pass dichroic filter (Semrock) before directing the fluorescence emission into the detectors. The excitation lasers were focused onto the sample using a Nikon 60× water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. Data were acquired at 100 MHz for 100 sec using a 16-bit ISS FCS PCI card to transfer data between the photodiodes and computer. Each measurement was repeated three times, correlated and fit independently using Craig Markwardt's MPFIT library in IDL 8.3 (Exellis) using custom written software.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5602116.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Fluorophore Labeling, Nanodisc Reconstitution and Single-molecule Observation of a G Protein-coupled Receptor","text":"Fluorophore Labeling, Nanodisc Reconstitution and Single-molecule Observation of a G Protein-coupled Receptor\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

The construct also contains C327S and C341S mutations, leaving just a single reactive cysteine residue (Cys265) for fluorophore labeling. The deletions, truncations and cysteine mutations do not disrupt binding of ligands to the receptor (Liu et al., 2012). The procedures to express the receptor in sf9 insect cells infected with high-titer recombinant virus are described elsewhere (Cherezov et al., 2008).A.  Receptor purification and Cy3 labeling1.  Lyse and wash frozen _2A R biomass (5 L, roughly 0.5 mg receptor/1 L biomass) using a 100ml glass tissue homogenizer. Cell lysis is chiefly achieved through the use of hypertonic (low salt) buffer and the mechanical force of homogenization. Wash lysed biomass with the low salt wash buffer and the high salt wash buffer 3 times, respectively ( 500~ml per wash). Use Beckman Ultra centrifuge to pellet membrane fragment suspension ( 158,000× g Ti45 rotor, 35 min, 4^°C_. ) in between washes. The washed membranes can be stored at -80~^°C for up to two weeks or 4~^°C overnight. Ideally, the washed membrane should be aliquoted, so that each aliquot of membranes contains roughly 0.5-1 mg of final purified receptor.2.  Treat one aliquot of washed membrane with 1 mM timolol (dissolved in ddH2O), 1 crushed Roche protease inhibitor tablet for 30 min at 4^°C . This step can be done by adding a previously prepared 100~m M timolol stock (stored at 4~^°C ) and crushed Roche inhibitor directly to the suspended membrane. Then, thoroughly mix the treated membrane with the solubilization buffer at 1:1 ratio for 3h at 4^°C .3.  Remove membrane pellet from supernatant using Beckman Ultra centrifuge (rotor Ti70) at 265,000 xg, , 35 min, 4^°C . Add stock 5 M NaCl, 4 M imidazole to the supernatant, so that the final concentration is 800 m M N a C l , 20~m M imidazole. Add 0.5 ml washed talon slurry to the supernatant and incubate at 4^°C overnight.4.  Pellet talon resin using Beckman X-12R centrifuge (or equivalent) at 500× g_: 1 min, 4^°C and remove supernatant. Wash with 50ml wash buffer 1, 10ml wash buffer 2, 10ml labeling buffer. Add 5ml labeling buffer on top of the pelleted resin, and 20ul of 5m g/m l (in DMSO) Cy3 stock (approximately 25uM final concentration, whereas the receptor concentration is approximately 1-5uM) . Incubate at 4^°C for 2 h in the dark.5.  Load talon resin onto an empty column and wash with 50~ml wash buffer 2 using gravity flow. Elute purified, labeled receptor using 1 ml fractions of elution buffer. Run SDS-PAGE to visualize the elution pattern. Concentrate Cy3-labeled receptors using a 100 kDa MWCO vivaspin2 concentrator.# B.  Nanodisc preparation1.  Mix labeled receptor, purified MSP1 and phospholipid mixture at a molar ratio 1:10:700 in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. The phospholipid mixture contains POPC, POPS and biotinyl Cap PE in the ratio 67.5% , 27.5% , and 5% . Add Bio-Bead resin and incubate overnight at 4^°C .2.  Remove Bio-Bead resin by pelleting. Purify nanodiscs by size exclusion chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column and SEC elution buffer. Representative elution profiles of membrane protein-nanodisc complexes are presented elsewhere (Ritchie et al., 2009). Remove empty nanodiscs by immobilized metal affinitychromatography (IMAC) using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, Ni column and IMAC elution buffer. Exchange buffer to the final buffer using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Note: Ni-NTA and talon (C o^2+) resins are both used to purify the receptor protein with poly-histidine tag, but differ in that 1) Nj^2+ has greater affinity for histidine, conferring a larger binding capacity per ml of resin, whereas 2) G o^2+ has greater selectivity toward histidine. As such talon resins are preferable to be used on crude lysate, as described in step A3 above, whereas Ni-NTA is preferable for the final purification step described here.C.  Surface immobilization of receptor-nanodisc complexes1.  Clean quartz slides and cover slips, passivate the surfaces with polyethylene glycol 5% biotinylated), as described previously (Lamichhane et al., 2010).2.  Prepare a microfluidic channel about 4-5m m wide on the quartz slide using double sided tape, fix cover slip on top of the double sided tape and close the two ends of channel using silicon grease at the time of experiment (Figure 2). This device is subsequently referred to as the sample chamber.()Double-SidedFigure 2. Illustration of the microfluidic sample chamber. Buffers or sample solutions are introduced through the entrance port via a pipette tip, as shown. Any excess solution flows out of the exit port, as shown.3.  Fill the sample chamber with 0.2m g/m l neutravidin and incubate for five minutes followed by final buffer wash.4.  Fill the sample chamber with 100~ul of receptor-nanodisc complexes (approximately 1 nM concentration), incubate for 10 m i n to allow complexes (containing 5% biotinylated lipids) to bind to neutravidin on the surface, then flush the chamber with imaging buffer.D.  Single-molecule fluorescence data acquisition1.  A microscope capable of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) measurements, equipped with a 532n m (green) laser for excitation (prism-based or objective-based illumination) and an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) camera capable of detecting the fluorescence emission from single fluorophores (Berezhna et al., 2012) is used to record a TIRF image of the surface at regular time intervals (e.g., every 100 msec or shorter, depending on the frame timeCopyright  2017 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.of the CCD camera) for a total period of at least 100 sec. Many discrete fluorescent spots should be visible in the image, each representing individual receptor-nanodisc complexes (Figure 3A).2.  Add a ligand, such as the agonist formoterol or inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (1 mM), to the sample chamber, allow ligand to interact with receptor (30 min to 1 h) and repeat the data acquisition. Alternatively, prepare a new sample chamber containing a pre-incubated mixture of receptor-nanodisc complexes and ligand.3.  As a control to test for non-specific binding, add receptor-nanodisc complexes to a surface lacking neutravidin. Very few fluorescent spots should be visible on the surface (Figure 3B).()Figure 3. TIRF images of immobilized receptor-nanodisc complexes and representative time trace for a single receptor-nanodisc complex (reproduced from Lamichhane et al., 2015). A. Typical TIRF image showing a 5×5um region (approximate dimensions) of immobilized Cy3-labeled _2A R reconstituted in nanodiscs. Each spot is due to the fluorescence emitted from an individual receptor-nanodisc complex. The very bright spots are due to a small fraction of receptor-nanodisc aggregates, which are readily identified and excluded from the data analysis. B. Corresponding TIRF image for a control surface lacking neutravidin. The number of fluorescent spots is greatly reduced relative to part A, indicating a negligible level of non-specific adsorption of receptor-nanodisc complexes. C. Representative fluorescence intensity versus time trace from a single nanodisc-bound receptor, showing repeated two-state intensity jumps prior to an irreversible photobleaching event. The red line is the best fit from Hidden Markov modeling. The single-step photobleaching transition confirms that a single receptor molecule is contained within the nanodisc.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Receptor Construct Description\nThe beta 2 adrenergic receptor construct contains a thermo-stabilizing E122W mutation, C-terminal truncation at residue 348, deletion of residues 245 to 259 in the third intracellular loop, a FLAG tag at the N-terminus, and a 10× His tag at the C-terminus.\nThe construct also contains C327S and C341S mutations, leaving just a single reactive cysteine residue for fluorophore labeling.\nThe deletions, truncations, and cysteine mutations do not disrupt binding of ligands to the receptor.\n## Receptor Purification and Cy3 Labeling\n## Lysis and Washing of Biomass\nLyse and wash frozen beta 2 adrenergic receptor biomass using a 100ml glass tissue homogenizer.\nWash lysed biomass with low salt wash buffer and high salt wash buffer three times, respectively.\nUse Beckman Ultra centrifuge to pellet membrane fragment suspension in between washes.\n## Treatment with Timolol and Protease Inhibitor\nTreat one aliquot of washed membrane with 1 mM timolol and 1 crushed Roche protease inhibitor tablet for 30 min at 4°C.\nThoroughly mix the treated membrane with the solubilization buffer at a 1:1 ratio for 3h at 4°C.\n## Removal of Membrane Pellet and Addition of NaCl and Imidazole\nRemove membrane pellet from supernatant using Beckman Ultra centrifuge.\nAdd stock 5 M NaCl and 4 M imidazole to the supernatant to achieve final concentrations of 800 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole.\n## Talon Resin Binding and Washing\nAdd 0.5 ml washed talon slurry to the supernatant and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nPellet talon resin using Beckman X-12R centrifuge and remove supernatant.\nWash with 50ml wash buffer 1, 10ml wash buffer 2, and 10ml labeling buffer.\n## Cy3 Labeling\nAdd 5ml labeling buffer and 20ul of 5mg/ml Cy3 stock to the pelleted resin and incubate at 4°C for 2h in the dark.\nLoad talon resin onto an empty column and wash with 50ml wash buffer 2 using gravity flow.\nElute purified, labeled receptor using 1 ml fractions of elution buffer and concentrate using a 100 kDa MWCO vivaspin2 concentrator.\n## Nanodisc Preparation\n## Mixing of Labeled Receptor, MSP1, and Phospholipid Mixture\nMix labeled receptor, purified MSP1, and phospholipid mixture at a molar ratio of 1:10:700 in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.\nAdd Bio-Bead resin and incubate overnight at 4°C.\n## Purification of Nanodiscs\nRemove Bio-Bead resin by pelleting.\nPurify nanodiscs by size exclusion chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system and superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column.\nRemove empty nanodiscs by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system and Ni column.\n## Buffer Exchange\nExchange buffer to the final buffer using a PD-10 desalting column.\n## Surface Immobilization of Receptor-Nanodisc Complexes\n## Cleaning and Passivation of Quartz Slides and Cover Slips\nClean quartz slides and cover slips.\nPassivate the surfaces with polyethylene glycol (5% biotinylated).\n## Preparation of Microfluidic Channel\nPrepare a microfluidic channel about 4-5mm wide on the quartz slide using double-sided tape.\nFix cover slip on top of the double-sided tape and close the two ends of the channel using silicon grease.\n## Immobilization of Receptor-Nanodisc Complexes\nFill the sample chamber with 0.2mg/ml neutravidin and incubate for five minutes.\nFill the sample chamber with 100ul of receptor-nanodisc complexes and incubate for 10min to allow complexes to bind to neutravidin on the surface.\n## Single-Molecule Fluorescence Data Acquisition\n## TIRF Microscopy\nUse a microscope capable of total internal reflection fluorescence measurements to record a TIRF image of the surface at regular time intervals.\nAdd a ligand, such as the agonist formoterol or inverse agonist ICI 118,551, to the sample chamber and repeat the data acquisition.\n## Control Experiment\nAdd receptor-nanodisc complexes to a surface lacking neutravidin as a control to test for non-specific binding.","keywords":"  -protein coupled receptors, _2 adrenergic receptor, Single-molecule fluorescence, Phospholipid nanodiscs, Conformational dynamics","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2332"}}

Generally, to obtain extracellular vesicles (EVs)-containing media, cells were initially grown in complete medium until reaching 75% confluence (usually 48 h); then, after two gentle washes with PBS, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h. Cells were plated in different plastic formats according to the experiments to be performed, but the density of them was kept constant at 3.2 ± 0.2 ×104/cm2 otherwise differently stated in the figure legends.Before starting NBI procedure, collected media were centrifuged at 2800g for 10 min and carefully transferred to new tubes.For the experiments in Fig. 2a, dFBS condition refers to NBI performed in media containing 100 K ultracentrifuged FBS at final concentration of 10%. These media have been diluted 1:10 with PBS to reduce viscosity of the solution.For cell density experiments in Fig. 2B, U-87-MG, MDA-MB-231, SH-SY5Y, MCF7 and PC-3 cell lines were plated in triplicates in 6-well plates with these numbers per well: 3.4 × 105; 1.7 × 105; 8.5 × 104; 4.2 × 104; 2.1 × 104 and 1.0 × 104. After 48 h of incubation in complete medium, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 24 h with serum-free medium before starting with NBI protocol. In this case, after removing EVs-containing media, adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with Hoechst33342 and washed with PBS for high content imaging analysis using Operetta instrument (Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired at 10× magnification and 50 fields/well were analysed by Harmony software. EVs were analysed by TRPS using qNano (IZON Science).2.2EVs isolation by differential ultracentrifugationEVs produced by U87-MG cells grown in T150 flasks (CLS430823-50EA) were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation according to the protocol by Di Vizio et al. [34] with minor modifications. Briefly, after 24 h of incubation with cells serum-free media were collected in falcon tubes and centrifuged at 2800g for 10 min at 4 °C to mainly remove cell debris and apoptotic bodies. Then, the supernatants were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes (Polyallomer Quick-Seal centrifuge tubes 25 × 89 mm, Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C in the Optima XE-90 (Beckman Coulter) instrument with SW 32 Ti rotor. This step allowed to preferentially precipitate larger particles (less apoptotic bodies, microvesicles), that were gently resuspended in filtered PBS (Res1). Thereafter, supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000g for 70 min at 4 °C to pellet smaller particles. Pellets were resuspendend in filtered PBS (Res2). The volumes of Res1 and Res2 were pooled and stored a −80 °C or kept at 4 °C to proceed with TRPS analyses. For experiments involving OptiPrep density gradient (ODG) preparations, we followed the protocol reported by Van Deun et al. [35], but starting from a volume of 200 ul of PBS, that resuspended the pellet of 100,000 g ultracentrifuged particles, loaded on the top of 5–40% iodixanol gradient. After ultracentrifugation, we pooled the fractions 8 to 10 and analysed by immunoblotting the pellet obtained by re-centrifugation at 100,000g for 2 h from a 3 ml solution.2.3Flow cytometry analysis of microvesiclesVesicles obtained by differential ultracentrifugation or NBI were diluted in 0.22 μm filtered PBS and background signal was set up on filtered PBS and the light scattering threshold level was adjusted to allow an event rate of ≤5 events per second.Light scattering detection was performed in log mode, the assigned voltages for FSC and SSC were 300 and 310 V, respectively, and the threshold was set at 200 for both signals. Acquisition was performed at low flow rate and samples were properly diluted to avoid coincidence and swarm effects. Bead standards of 1 and 10 μm (Invitrogen) were used to set gates for microvesicles. A number of 10,000 events was counted or at least 1 min recording for each sample. Sample acquisition was performed on a FACS Canto flow-cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analysis using BD Diva software (BD Biosciences).2.4Nickel-based isolation (NBI)Positively charged agarose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-5268-01) were prepared with a suspension of 20 mg/ml in PBS containing 190 mM of NiSO4 (Sigma, 656895). Residual amount of cations was removed by repeated PBS washing and centrifugation and beads were stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month.The capture of EVs has been optimized using 20 μl/ml of beads from the prepared suspension and entirely performed at room temperature. An excess of beads ensured better reproducibility and maximal EVs recovery. Briefly, beads were gently added on the upper surface of the EVs-containing medium and the solution placed in orbital shaking for 30 min, well homogenized during incubation. Thereafter, tubes were gently centrifuged (~200g) and then maintained in vertical position for 5 min to allow beads to settle down by gravity. The elution buffer, freshly prepared by diluting solution A (3.2 mM EDTA, ThermoFisher, UltraPure pH 8.0, 15575020) and B (10 mM NaCl, Sigma, 450006, 45 μM citric acid, Sigma, 251275) in 0.22 μm-filtered PBS allowed competitive EVs-beads dissociation and release of EVs in solution at physiological pH (7.4).2.5Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)The vesicles were visualized using conventional transmission EM (TEM). Briefly, a 5 μl aliquot of a purified sample, fixed in elution buffer with 2.5% formaldehyde, was applied to 300-square mesh copper-nickel grids coated with a thin carbon film. The grids were subsequently negatively stained with 1% buffered uranyl acetate, pH 4.5, and observed using a TEM FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope operating at 100 kV and equipped with an Olympus Morada side-mount 2Kx4K charge-coupled device camera (magnification used: 20500× and 87,000×).2.6TRPS (tunable resistive pulse sensing)Size and concentration of the EVs were characterized by TRPS using qNano (IZON Science). An average of 500 particles were counted for each sample, except for experiments performed in 6-well plates (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3, and Fig. S4) or in samples where the particle rate was below 100 particle/min, in which at least 2 min recording time was used. NP200 (A40948, A43545, A43667, A43667), NP400 (A43592, A44117, A44116), NP800 (A40542, A36164, A40548, A44118) and N1000 (A40572) nanopores, stretched between 45.5 and 47 mm were used. Voltage was set in between 0.12 and 0.68 to achieve and maintain a stable current in the range of 95–130 nA, noise below 7–12 pA and particle count rate linear. The calibration beads CPC100B (Batch ID: B8748N), CPC200B (Batch ID: B6481M), CPC500E (Batch ID: 659543B), CPC800E (Batch ID: 634561B) and CPC1000F (Batch ID: 669582B) with mean diameters of 114 nm, 210 nm, 500 nm, 710 nm and 940 nm, respectively, were from iZON Science. All the qNANO data were recorded and analysed by Izon Control Suite v.3.2.7Protein competitive assayThe step of EVs elution has been challenged by a competitive assay in which 10 ml of medium containing EVs deriving from U87 cells was supplemented with 30 μg/ml of DH5α E. coli crude extract and with 15 μg/ml of purified histidine-tagged recombinant proteins (T7 RNA pol, 110 kDa; HuR, 36 kDa; YTH, 23 kDa). Briefly, DH5α cells were grown in LB medium until they reached an OD600 of 0.5 and were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 5 min. Pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM medium +1 μg/ml lysozyme and sonicated at 4 °C in water bath for 7 cycles (40 amplitude, 7 s on, 10 s off). Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000g for 20 min and then filtered with 0.2 μm membrane disposals prior to be spiked to the EVs-containing medium. Histidine-tagged recombinant T7 RNA polymerase was kindly provided by Dr. S. Mansy's lab (CIBIO, University of Trento); recombinant HuR [36] and YTH [37] proteins produced and purified as previously described.NBI was performed with incubation times and reagents already described, except for the gradient of elution solutions as indicated in Fig. 1b. Protein samples were quantified using BCA and Bradford assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal volume of eluates were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE for subsequent Sypro Ruby staining or western blotting using a 1:1000 dilution of a primary anti-histidine antibody (ab1187).Fig. 1Rapid purification of EVs by NBI preserving their integrity, dispersity, and stability in solution. a) At pH values >5 the net negative charge of membranous particles makes them susceptible to electrostatic interactions. Using 1–3 mM of chelating agents, TRPS analyses detected particles in the 500–700 nm range of size, selectively eluted from a functionalized stationary phase in contrast to nucleic acids (A260), proteins (A280), or pre-stained ssRNA (RNA Y) pre-incubated with nickel-agarose beads. The procedural steps highlighting the rapid NBI procedure are depicted. b) Competitive assay in serum-free medium containing 500 μg/ml of DH5α protein extract and of 50 μg/ml each of purified his-tagged proteins (T7p07, HuR, YTH domain). Two parallel gels were exposed to SYPRO Ruby or blotted on PVDF membrane to detect hstidine (tag known to confer the strongest interaction with Ni). The 1× solution is the optimized buffer and the flow-through (FT) is the medium after beads sedimentation. qNANO analyses with indicated nanopores were performed and SD refers to two independent experiments. c) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) acquisitions, with 3 fields at 20.500× (1 μm) + 5× magnification and 3 fields at 87.000× (200 nm) + 5× magnification, of NBI samples fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in the elution buffer. The original scale bars are embedded at the bottom right, but also added manually on the left side for better visualization. d) Western blot analyses on EV lysate (recovered by 14 × 106 cells) and on 1% total cell lysate (TCL) of U87 cells. e) Mixture of 4.2 × 109 liposomes with a diameter of 181 ± 23.8 nm recovered by ultracentrifugation (UC) or NBI. The same experiment has been replicated with phosphatidylethanolamine-rhodamine (5 ng/ml) stain (PE-Rho) of liposomes prior UC or NBI processing. f) EVs were isolated by UC or NBI from 3 ml of serum-free medium of U87 cells and analysed at (t0) or after 24 days (t24, stored at 4 °C). Repeated measurements by TRPS have been performed until 52 days post-purification and the relative half-live of the 600 nm populations have been calculated with GraphPad Prism software v.5.Fig. 1Number and size of recovered particles were analysed by TRPS, in all the fractions, using NP800, NP400, and NP200 nanopores.For IP with apolipoproteins, 50 μg of whole cell lysate and the lysate of EVs isolated from the media of three T150 flasks per each condition: UC and NBI) were separated by a pre-cast gradient SDS-PAGE (Bolt™ 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels, 12-well, Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Hybond P 0.2 μm PVDF) overnight. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min, the membrane was incubated in 1% milk TBS-T with antibodies against Apo B100 (ab7616, Abcam, 1:1000), Apo A1 (ab7613, Abcam, 1:1000), Syntenin (1:1000), Flotillin-1 (1:1000), Alix (1:1000) at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1–2 h. Blots were washed with TBS-T three times and the immunoblot signal was revealed using the chemiluminescent ECL Select detection reagent (GE Healthcare Amersham, UK).2.8Preparation of exosome-like liposomesThe lipid composition of exosome-like vesicles was: 20% mol egg phosphatidylcholine, 10% mol egg phosphatidylethanolamine, 15% mol dioleoylphosphatidylserine, 15% mol egg sphingomyelin, 40% mol cholesterol (adapted from literature [38,39]). Lipid films were formed by removing the organic solvent (i.e. chloroform) from a lipid solution by rotary evaporation and vacuum drying for at least 1 h. Lipids at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, were swollen in DPBS and vortexed vigorously to give multilamellar liposomes, which were further exposed to 6 cycles of freezing and thawing. Exosome-like liposomes were prepared by extruding a suspension of multilamellar liposomes with a two-syringes extruder (LiposoFast Basic Unit, Avestin Inc.). Thirty-one passages were performed through two stacked polycarbonate filters (Millipore) with pores of different average diameters to obtain differently sized vesicles [40], then measured by photon correlation spectroscopy with a Zeta Sizer instrument (Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments).2.9Blood samplesPlasma samples derived from patients with metastatic colon cancer were provided by the IRST Cancer Center. All patients gave informed consent before blood sampling, approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Patients' tumors were characterized for BRAF status by MassARRAY (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) using the Myriapod Colon status (Diatech Pharmacogenetics, Jesi, Italy). Plasma was obtained from peripheral blood collected in EDTA-tubes, after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min, and stored at −80 °C until EV isolation.Whole blood from healthy donors were collected at Meyer Children's University Hospital. Plasma samples were collected into commercially available anticoagulant-treated tubes EDTA-treated (lavender tops), serum samples in red topped tubes. The venous blood in EDTA tube was shipped on cold packs from hospital blood collection unit to the laboratory. Informed consent were obtained from donors before the sample analysis.Plasma has been obtained by removing cells after centrifugation for 10 min at 2000g using a refrigerated (4 °C) centrifuge (Eppendorf 5702 R, Milan, Italy). Serum samples have been obtained allowing the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature for 30 min. The clot has been removed by spin down at 2000g using a refrigerated (4 °C) centrifuge (Eppendorf 5702 R, Milan, Italy). Blood count were performed using a Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex America, Mundelein, IL). The analytic procedure was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.Blood from metastatic prostate cancer patients was obtained at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) after informed consent (IRB #1305013903). Whole blood (Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT) was centrifuged at 1600 g × 10 min at 4 °C within 3 h after blood collection. The plasma layer was transferred to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 g × 10 min at 4 °C. The plasma was then collected and stored at −80 °C. Complete blood counts (CBC) was performed in the WCM clinical lab and results obtained from chart review.Immunodepletion of NBI-purified vesicles has been performed using biotinylated anti CD235a (130-100-271) and anti CD41a (130-105-608) from Miltenyl Biotec, anti-AL-CAM (sc-74558), anti-MEL-CAM (sc-18837), anti CD45 (sc-1187) from SantaCruz Biotechnology, and streptavidin (11205D) or protein-G (10003D) dynabeads from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Vesicles after beads precipitation have been measured by qNANO and normalized to the number of particles in the counterpart control samples with equivalent amount of biotin (Sigma, B4501).2.10Tumor sample analysisFormalin fixed and paraffin included (FFPE) patients' tumor samples, used for routinary molecular diagnostic, were selected for containing an area of at least 50% of tumor cells, based on hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumor genomic DNA was extracted with QIAamp DNA Micro kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocol, and DNA quantity and quality was determined at Nanodrop (CELBIO, Milan, Italy). Characterization of BRAF status was performed by Pyrosequencing with the anti-EGFR MoAb response® BRAF status assay (Diatech Pharmacogenetics, Jesi, Italy): 50 ng of starting FFPE genomic DNA were amplified and reactions were run on the PyroMark Q96 ID system (QIAGEN), according to Diatech Pharmacogenetics protocol. For samples 7, 12, 13, 23, and 26, Qualitative detection of BRAF-V600E and KRAS-G12D/G12C mutations was repeated on 30 ng of tumor DNA, by using either the Easy®BRAF kit or the Easy®KRAS kit, on Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (QIAGEN), following manufacturer's instructions (Diatech Pharmacogenetics). The assay allows the detection of low percentages of mutated allele by real-time amplification with sequence-specific probes: positivity for BRAF-V600E was considered over the internal BRAF control, as a delta Ct lover than 12.5 cycles, and setting the detection threshold on 0.04, according to the guidelines of Diatech Pharmacogenetics.2.11RNA extractionTotal RNA was extracted using QIAzol reagent (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions with several modifications. Briefly, 100 μl of QIAzol was added directly to the beads before the elution step of NBI, vortexed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, supplemented with 20 μl of chloroform, shaken vigorously for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the upper phase was recovered. After addition of 1 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml) and 100 μl of isopropanol, RNA was precipitated overnight at −80 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min, RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, centrifuged as above and resuspended in 10 μl RNase-free water. RNA was quantified using the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions.2.12Amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (alpha)Reactions were carried out in 384-Optiplate (Perkin Elmer) in a final volume of 20 μl. Assay was optimized in PBS using 15 μg/ml of nichel-chelate AlphaLisa Acceptor beads and 10 μg/ml of streptavidin-Donor beads with serial dilutions of antibody to identify hook point. The presence of surface markers was analysed in dose-response with serial dilution of EVs, previously characterized by TRPS. EVs were purified by NBI from plasma of healthy donors or from serum-free medium of tumor cell lines. Alpha counts were revealed by Enspire instrument (Perkin Elmer) after 90 min of plate incubation in the dark at room temperature. We used a biotinylated antibody against human PSMA (Cusabio, CSB-PA018865LD01HU) and a recombinant his-tagged PSMA (Origene, NM_002786) for a standard curve quantification.2.13Reverse transcription and droplet digital PCRReverse transcription was performed using miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR, Universal cDNA Synthesis Kit II (Exiqon) following the manufacturer's instructions with the following reaction composition: 2.3 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 1.15 μl enzyme mix, 0.5 μl synthetic RNA spike-in and 7.5 μl of template total RNA.QX200TM Droplet DigitalTM PCR System (BioRad) was used to quantify mRNA copies using EvaGreen chemistry and the following primers: 5′-CAACGAATTTGGCTACAGCA-3′ and 5′-AGGGGTCTACATGGCAACTG-3′ for GAPDH; 5′-GATTTTGGTCTAGCTACAGA and 5′-GGATTTTTATCTTGCATTC for BRAF.The direct encapsulation of EVs into oil droplets has been performed using isolated EVs as input sample, EvaGreen master mix supplemented with 5 U/ml of WarmStart® RTx Reverse Transcriptase (NEB) and with 3 mM magnesium sulphate. The standard protocol of ddPCR included a starting 10 min step at 55 °C followed by 5 min at 65 °C.We optimized the procedure working with 102–106 polydisperse EVs to obtain at least 15,000 droplets in each assay.2.14Statistical analysesThe data and the number of independent experiments are indicated in the relative figure legends. Anova, t-test, and Pearson r coefficient were calculated by GraphPad Prism Software v5.1, and results were considered statistically significant when P value was <0.05 (*), <0.01 (**), <0.001 (***).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6558028.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Intravenous Tomato Lectin Injection to Assess Functional Vasculature","text":"Intravenous Tomato Lectin Injection to Assess Functional Vasculature\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  1 ml syringes\n2.  30 gauge needles\n3.

After 10 days of incubation the CAM is dropping and tumor cells (green) are applied to it. After allowing xenografted tumor cells to grow, the tumor and chicken tissues are harvested on day 5-7 for Alu PCR.1.  Preparing the eggs for xenografting tumor cells a.  Freshly fertilized chicken eggs are incubated on their side in a rotating incubator at 37~^°C and 60% humidity for 10 days. The eggs are rotated three times per hour (Figures 2.1 and 2.2)b.  On day 10 the eggs are placed on their side on an egg rack (Figure 2.3). Use a tube lamp or other suitable light source to candle the eggs by shining the light at the blunt end of the egg where the air sack is located. The embryo must be located near the bottom of the egg and the air sack on its right. Localize and mark using a pencil the allantoic vein that is located at the top of the eggshell, right where several blood vessels cross (Figure 2.4).c.  Clean the area, including and around the mark, using a cotton swab soaked with iodine (Figure 2.5).d.  Drill a small hole through the eggshell into the air sack using a 30-gauge syringe needle (Figures 2.6 and 3A).e.  Make another hole near the allantoic vein, which penetrates the shell membrane but not the CAM, using a Dremel rotary tool kit (Figures 2.7 and 3B). The CAM is attached to the inner surface of the shell, so care should be exercised at this point. Use a 20-gauge syringe needle with a small hook on the end to make a third very small hole in the eggshell membrane (Figure 3C, Note 1).()Figure 2. A serial depiction of the model. 1 and 2. Incubate the eggs; 3. Prepare a clean area and set all the materials; 4. Mark the location of the allantoic vein; 5. Apply iodine using a cotton swab; 6 and 7. Drill holes in the eggshell; 8. Drop the CAM; 9. Cut an opening for tumor cell grafting; 10. Apply the tumor cells and wait for 5 min; 11. Seal the hole using laboratory tape; 12. Incubate the eggs.f.  To suction, create with an automatic pipette aid fitted with a piece of Tygon tubing placed against the hole in the airsac. To separate the CAM from the shell and let it drop, apply a mild vacuum to the hole over the air sack so the blood vessel drops down, away from the eggshell and attaches to the embryo (Figures 2.8 and 3D).g.  Use a cut off wheel (Dremel) to cut a square window (1Omegac m^2) approximately 0.5 cm away from the branch point in the vein to expose the underlying CAM. A pair of needle-nose forceps can be used to remove a small section of eggshell in the square window and expose the CAM (Figures 2.9 and 3E).h.  Once the CAM is dropped, seal the hole located near the chorioallantoic vein using laboratory tape.i.  Then place the eggs in an egg rack into a stationary incubator at 37~^°C and 60% humidity in anticipation for grafting the tumor cells.()Figure 3. A six panel diagram illustrating the appearance of the chick embryo metastasis model in cross section at key steps. A. After 10 days of incubation, the allantoic vein is positioned against the top of the egg. Drill one hole in the eggshell into the air sack using a 30 G syringe needle. B. Make another hole using a Dremel rotary tool kit adjacent to the attachment point for the allantoic vein. C. Make a third small hole in the eggshell membrane using a _20 G syringe needle. D. Apply a mild vacuum into the hole over the air sack to evacuate the air and drop the CAM. E. Cut a square window (1c m^2) using a Dremel cut off wheel and remove a small section of eggshell to expose the CAM. F. Graft the tumor cells onto the CAM.2.  Preparing tumor cells for graftinga.  Detach tumor cells from their culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice in order to remove any residual media.b.  Cells are counted using a Neubauer chamber and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at 40 million cells/ml depending on the cell line used (Note 2).3.  Grafting the tumor cells onto the CAMUsing a 20-200 μl pipette place 25~ul of the cell suspension onto a small area of the CAM (Figures 2.10 and 3F). The optimal number of cells should be determined empirically, but can range from 0.4~×~10^5 to 2 × 10^6 depending on the growth and ‘invasiveness’ characteristics of the tumor cell line used. Different tumors and cell suspensions derived from tumors have been implanted on the CAM (Tables 1 and 2). Tumor cell lines grow and intravasate to the vasculature with different efficiencies. For instance, suspensions of A375 melanoma (1×10^6) , SKMEL2 melanoma (1×10^6) , RKO colorectal carcinoma (2×10^6) , HCT116 (0.5×10^6) , U87 glioblastoma (0.2×10^6) , PC3 prostate carcinoma (1×10^6) , Hep3 epidermoid carcinoma (0.4×10^6) , HT-1080 fibrosarcom (0.5×10^6) cell lines; have been grafted on the CAM of embryonated chicken eggs. All cell lines tested formed 4-8 mm size tumors, which recapitulated hallmarks of corresponding human specimens. Depending on the tissue origin, number of tumor cells and their proliferation capacity, primary CAM tumors can reach up to 500-600 mg in 6-7 days after cell inoculation.b.  Seal the window in the egg tightly with laboratory tape and leave the eggs in a position with the embryos standing upright for 5-10 min, in order to allow the cells to settle (Figure 2.11).c.  After 10 min, return the eggs to the stationary incubator (Figure 2.12).d.  Allow cells to grow for 5-7 days depending on the nature of the tumor cell line used. This time should be enough for a macroscopic tumor to be visible.e.  The CAM model allow experimental studies of potential anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic compounds. Tumors can be treated topically on the upper CAM with potential anti-cancer drugs. For instance, to evaluate the effects of DEL22379 in A375 and RKO tumor growth we inoculated tumor cells on the CAM and incubate the embryos for 4 days at 37~^°C and 60% humidity. Then, we added 10~uM DEL22379 (prepare freshly, soluble in DMSO) topically on the CAM and treatment was refreshed every 12h . Two days later tumors were harvested.# Table 1.

The chick chorioallantoic membrane as an in vivo xenograft model to study tumor growth and metastasis()Harvesting tumors and chick embryo tissues a.  Perform dissections in an area free of contaminating DNA (Figure 4.1). To detect metastatic invasion this assay quantifies the presence of ectopic DNA in chicken organs using a highly sensitive PCR approach. Therefore, it is very important to prevent contamination with exogenous DNA.b.  In order not to have cross-contamination of your samples, use three separated sets of surgery tools. One set for cutting the egg, one set for harvesting the primary tumor and one set for removing the internal tissues.c.  Prepare three wash containers for sequential rinsing of the tools between each animal and change their liquid between different experimental groups. Sequentially these washes are: distilled water, 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.d.  Get the eggs from the stationary incubator.e.  Open a new window removing some of the eggshell such that the tumors become visible. At this point, you can take some pictures of the appearance of the macroscopic tumor (Figures 4-6).f.  Resect the primary tumor from the CAM and weigh the tumor.g.  Remove the chick embryo from the eggshell by cutting the shell radially into equal halves.()Figure 4. Pictures showing tumor and chicken tissues harvest. 1. Perform dissection in a clean area. 2. Open a new window removing some of the eggshell and resect the primary tumor from the CAM. 3. Cut the eggshell radially into equal halves and harvest lower CAM. 4. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum and collect a piece of liver.h.  Transfer the embryo to a clean weight boat. The animal must be dissected using a clean set of tools.i. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum. Once the embryo is open, collect a piece of the liver. To harvest the lung, cut the rib cage and separate from the breast.j. Harvested samples can be processed immediately for DNA isolation or stored at -80~^°C for later extraction of DNA, if necessary.()HCT116 SKMEL 2Figure 5. Different tumors have been implanted on the CAM. Tumors were formed using 0.5 x 10^6 HCT116 colorectal cancer cells or 1×10^6 SKMEL2 melanoma cells during 5 and 7 days respectively.# 5.  Genomic DNA isolationa.  To extract genomic DNA from tissues, we use the DNA kit from Qiagen. Purified DNA following manufacturer’s instructions. DNA can be used immediately or stored at -20~^°C . Dilute the DNA 1:50 or 1:25 to get 30 n g/u l in nuclease free water before using it for the PCR reaction.# 6.  PCR analysisa.  To detect human tumor cell DNA in the chick tissues we use quantitative PCR for human Alu sequences using Alu-specific primers and SYBR green mix amplification kit. Prepare the reaction mix in a final volume of 10ul , with 0.4~uM of each primer. Optimize the amount of template DNA empirically, we usually use 30 ng. Use chicken GAPDH primers as an internal control. The PCR is run under the following conditions: 95~^°C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95^°C for 30 sec, 63^°C for 30 sec, 72^°C for 30 sec.b.  Generate a standard curve using a dilution series of human DNA (10^2,10^3,10^4) from the original tumor cells. Use this standard curve to quantify human tumor cells in a chick embryonic metastasis assay.c.  Measure Ct values in triplicate and against the standard curve calculate the number of tumor cells in each CAM and liver sample.d.  Invaded cells are detected using either 30 ng of 50 ng of total CAM DNA. Use water as a negative control.e.  To evaluate results and statistical significance of control and experimental groups, use Graph Pad Prism software and Student t-test or ANOVA analysis (Figure 6).()Figure 6. DEL 22379 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Tumors were formed using 1×10^6 A375 p melanoma cells (A) or 2×10^6 R K O colorectal cancer cells (B). Cells were applied to the CAM of day-10 embryos. Four days after applying the tumor cells half of the embryos were treated with DMSO and the other half with DEL22379 (10 uM) . Two days later tumors were harvested to weigh. CAM and chick organs (lung) were harvested from embryos bearing tumors and subjected to quantitative Alu PCR. Conversely, quantitative PCR of chGAPDH was used as an internal control to confirm the presence of equivalent quantities of host genomic DNA. Data shows average pm SEM from 3 independent experiments. ^P<0.05 ; ^P<0.005 , by unpaired Student t-test (Herrero et al., 2015).# Notes1.  A small hook on the end of the _20 G syringe needle is necessary to make the third hole in the eggshell membrane. Try to do it very softly and carefully not to tear the underlying CAM. 2.

All mice were 8–10 weeks old at the beginning of experimental procedures. Before surgery, mice were group housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water, unless otherwise specified. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee.Surgical proceduresAAV2/8-CaMKIIa-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (hM4D) and AAV2/8-CaMKIIa-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (hM3D) viral vectors were purchased from the Vector Core at the University of North Carolina, AAV2/8-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP (ChR2) and AAV2/8-CB7-CI-EGFP-RBG (GFP control) from the Vector Core at the University of Pennsylvania. Stereotaxic surgery was conducted on mice maintained on isoflurane anaesthesia. For hM3D and hM4D experiments, viral vectors were bilaterally infused into the mAON (10° angle towards midline targeting A/P: +2.5 mm, M/L: ±0.5 mm D/V: −3.5 mm in Paxinos and Franklin, 2007) in a volume of 0.1–0.2 μl. For retrograde tracing experiments, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CTB was infused into the mAON in a volume of 0.1 μl. For ChR2 experiments, viral vectors were bilaterally infused into the vHPC (10° angle away from midline, targeting A/P: −3.1 mm, D/V: −4.0 mm, M/L:±3.25 mm) in a volume of 0.3–0.4 μl, and optical fibres (200 μm core, 0.39 NA; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA) threaded through 1.25 mm-wide zirconia ferrules (Thorlabs) were bilaterally implanted directly above the mAON or PFC (10° angle towards midline targeting A/P: +1.5 mm, M/L: ±0.5 mm D/V: −2.25 mm). All infusions were made at a rate of 0.1 μl min−1 by pressure ejection by means of a cannula connected by Tygon tubing to a 10 μl Hamilton syringe mounted on an infusion pump. Following surgery, animals were single housed and testing began 2 weeks later.DrugsCNO (obtained from the NIH as part of the Rapid Access to Investigative Drug Program funded by the NINDS) was dissolved in a solution of 10% DMSO and 0.9% saline. CNO or its vehicle was administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 10 ml kg−1 10 min before the start of all behavioural testing. A dose of 5 mg kg−1 CNO was used throughout testing in all groups of animals. All drug treatments were randomized and separated by 72 h.Apparatus for optogenetic experimentsStimulation of vHPC terminals in the mAON was achieved by illumination with 473 nm blue light generated by a diode-pumped solid state laser (Laserglow, Toronto, ON, Canada), the output of which was controlled by a waveform generator (Keysight technologies, California, USA). For behavioural experiments, the laser was connected to a 1 × 2 optical commutator (Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) which split the light beam into two separate arena patch cables that were attached to implanted optical fibres.In vitro patch-clamp slice recordingsBrains were rapidly removed after decapitation and placed into a cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 205 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 3 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4, osmolality 300 mOsm kg−1. Transverse slices (350 μm) containing the mAON were prepared from mice previously infected with AAV containing hM4D- or hM3D-mCherry in the mAON, or ChR2-GFP in the vHPC. Slices recovered at 32 °C in a 50:50 mixture composed of cutting saline artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) for 30 min and then placed in aCSF alone for 30 min. During experimentation slices were perfused at a rate of 2 ml min−1 in aCSF. The aCSF solution consisted of the following (in mM): 123 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 2 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2 in double-distilled water and saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2, pH 7.4, osmolarity 300 mOsm. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from transduced neurons in the mAON. Micropipettes were filled with an intracellular fluid containing the following (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP and 10 phosphocreatine, pH 7.4, osmolality 300 mOsm kg−1.For hM4D and hM3D experiments, neurons were identified by mCherry fluorescence. The resting membrane potential was recorded (in current-clamp mode) in normal aCSF for a minimum of 5 min before the addition of 1 μM CNO for 10 min. Neuronal excitability was determined in current-clamp mode by injecting current in 10 pA steps from 50 to 150 pA.For the current-induced action potential analysis in hM3D and hM4D samples, all recordings were performed on minimum of three animals per group. Recordings were initiated 10 min after membrane rupture. A series of 500 ms currents at increasing steps (100–300 pA) were injected to neurons, and the number of action potentials was quantified in the neurons firing multiple action potentials.For ChR2 experiments, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from putative pyramidal neurons in the mAON. Membrane potential changes were measured while 5 ms pulses of 473 nm blue light were applied (5 mW, 4 Hz).Olfactory sensitivity testIn a 10 min habituation session, mice were placed in a clear plexiglass test cage measuring 12 × 16 × 12 cm, which contained a Q-tip soaked with mineral oil or water. The arena was enclosed and the Q-tip was inserted through a hole in the roof. Following habituation, 7.5 μl of increasing concentrations (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1%) of peanut butter dissolved in mineral oil or almond extract dissolved in distilled water were presented to mice on the Q-tip. The amount of time spent directly investigating the Q-tip was examined in consecutive 5 min trials each separated by a 5 min inter-trial interval. Each trial was recorded at a rate of 60 fps using a NIKON D5200 video camera equipped with a 30 mm prime lens. Scoring was completed offline using frame-by-frame analysis from the side-view video of the chamber, and the criterion for scoring investigation was head up sniffing within 1 cm of the Q-tip. Chewing or direct manipulation of the Q-tip was not scored. In accordance with a within-subjects design, animals were tested twice following treatment with either CNO or its vehicle in a counterbalanced fashion.Habituation/dishabituation testTesting was carried out in the same chamber as that used in olfactory sensitivity. Mice were first habituated to the test arena containing a dry Q-tip for 10 min. In 3 min trials, mice were sequentially presented with new Q-tips permeated with water, two non-social neutral odours, or two social odours, each presented for three trials with a 2 min inter-trial interval. The amount of time spent investigating the Q-tip on each trial was scored. The criterion for scoring investigation was head up sniffing within 1 cm of the Q-tip. Chewing or direct manipulation of the Q-tip was not scored. Habituation was defined as a reduction in investigation of a repeatedly presented odour, while dishabituation was defined as a reinstatement of investigation of the Q-tip when a novel odour was presented. The non-social odours used include almond extract, vanilla extract, banana extract and mineral oil. Social odours were obtained from swabs of bedding from two cages of three adult conspecific males and two cages of three conspecific females, which had not been changed for ∼1 week. Investigation time following CNO or its vehicle was always assessed using a counterbalanced within-subjects design. As such, in the first session, mice were presented with odours of water, almond, vanilla, male cage 1 and female cage 1. In the second session, mice were presented with odours of water, banana, mineral oil, male cage 2 and female cage 2.Buried food testTwo days before behavioural testing, mice were acclimatized to the food reward (M&M mini) by placing two samples in their home cage overnight. Experiments were performed in a 40 × 12 × 12 cm clear plexiglass chamber filled with 3 cm of corncob bedding. Mice received three 10 min habituation sessions on three consecutive days wherein one piece of food reward was placed on top of the bedding in the centre of the arena. Animals were then overnight food restricted before testing. In a test session, mice were given three consecutive trials to find ¼ of an M&M mini (0.06 g) pseudorandomly buried beneath the bedding in one of five approximate locations (four corners or centre). Immediately after being placed in the arena, the latency to find the buried food was measured using a stopwatch; the trial ended when mice visibly retrieved and began consuming the food. Within a test session, each mouse received three consecutive trials to find the buried food and the average of these three trials were taken as the latency score. Between trials, the bedding was replaced and the chamber wiped with 70% ethanol solution. Mice first underwent three baseline testing sessions (that is, without CNO or vehicle injections), after which the scored test following the experimental manipulation began. Animals were tested twice, after treatment with either CNO or its vehicle, in a counterbalanced fashion. Following each test session, mice were given ad libitum access to chow and testing was carried out every other day to allow for adequate food consumption following restriction. In the vHPC-mAON ChR2 condition, mice were tested once with optical stimulation of vHPC terminals in the mAON (4 Hz 1 mW, 5 ms pulse width) throughout each trial, and again without stimulation. For the vHPC-PFC condition, mice were only tested once with stimulation applied during each trial. Two GFP control mice from the vHPC-PFC condition were excluded from data analysis due to a consistent lack of engagement in testing.Social interaction testSocial interaction was assessed using Crawley's three-chamber apparatus, consisting of three 40 cm wide × 20 cm long × 40 cm high chambers. Removable partitions (5 cm wide × 40 cm high) in the walls allowed animals to traverse between chambers. The two far chambers each contained a cylindrical wire cage with a diameter of 10.5 cm and height of 11 cm with bars spaced 1 cm apart, while the middle chamber was empty. Testing was conducted under red light and the presence of tone generators to minimize reliance on visual and auditory cues. Each session involved three separate 10-min phases: habituation, sociability and social recognition. Each phase was separated by a two minute interval. Test animals were always placed in the centre chamber and removal of both partitions marked the beginning of the test. In the habituation phase, animals were allowed to acclimate to the entire test arena with partitions removed and both wire cages empty. In the sociability phase, a young adult male C57BL/6 mouse unfamiliar to the test subject was added to a wire cage on one side of the arena (counterbalanced between subjects), while the other wire cage was left empty. In the social recognition phase, a second juvenile male mouse, also unfamiliar with the test subject, was added to the wire cage that was previously occupied and the first, now-familiar, animal was placed in the previously empty cage (counterbalanced between subjects). In both sociability and novelty preference phases, behaviour was recorded using an overhead camera with ANY-maze (Stoelting). Direct interactions were manually scored, offline, from overhead videos. Criteria used for scoring were direct contact of subject's nose with the wire cage or mouse contained therein, while climbing on the wire cage was excluded from scoring. Data were presented as a percentage time spent investigating the target cage over the entire time spent engaged in investigation of either cages. All mice were tested once in accordance with a between-subjects design following treatment with either CNO or its vehicle. In our hands, repetition of this test in the same animal was not possible; data between first and second test sessions was inconsistent between test animals. For ChR2 experiments, mice underwent 10 min habituation and sociability phases wherein no stimulation was applied, followed by a 7 min social recognition phase during which optical stimulation (4 Hz 1 mW, 5 ms pulse width) of vHPC terminals in the mAON or PFC was applied throughout.Open field testMice were placed in a clear Plexiglas box measuring 50 cm wide × 50 cm long × 20 cm high. Distance travelled was measured in a 30 min session from an overhead video using ANY-maze (Stoelting) Animals were tested twice following treatment with either CNO or its vehicle in a counterbalanced fashion.Real-time place preferenceMice in the ChR2 condition were placed in an arena with two distinct chambers measuring 10 × 20 × 15 cm. One chamber had vertical stripes on the walls and the other with an array of filled circles. To engage olfactory circuits, each chamber also had an enclosed petri dish with five holes drilled into the top containing the spices ginger (vertical stripes) or thyme (circles). Entry of the animal into one chamber was paired with constant laser stimulation (4 Hz, 1 mW, 5 ms pulse width) controlled by an input/output signal from predefined regions of an overhead video using ANY-maze (Stoelting). The laser-paired chamber was counterbalanced between animals. Mice could move freely between chambers and time spent in each chamber was measured in a 10 min session.Elevated plus mazeThe EPM apparatus consists of two black plastic open arms (30 cm × 5 cm) perpendicularly conjoined at a centre (5 cm × 5 cm) with two plastic enclosed arms (30 cm × 5 cm × 30 cm). The maze was elevated one meter from the ground. In a red-light setting, mice were placed in the centre and after 1 min testing began. Movement of the animal's body throughout the maze was tracked using ANY-maze tracking software (Stoelting) through an overhead camera for a period of 5 min. The time spent in the open arms was expressed as a percentage of the time spent in both open and closed arms.Novelty suppressed feedingBefore testing, mice were deprived of food for a period of 24 h. During testing, mice were treated with either CNO or vehicle and then placed in a brightly lit open-field arena, which contained ∼5 g of standard chow on top of a 5 cm × 5 cm piece of aluminium foil situated in the arena centre. All mice were consistently placed in the same corner of the arena signalling the start of testing. The time taken to retrieve and begin consuming the food reward in the centre was scored using a stop watch.Home cage food consumptionBefore testing, mice were deprived of food for a period of 24 h. During testing, mice were treated with either CNO or vehicle and then given free access to a pre-determined amount of chow (∼5 g) in their home cage. Food intake was recorded 5 min after food was made available. Spillage of food was collected by filter paper placed underneath the chow and was taken into consideration when calculating food intake.Hole-board testThe hole-board apparatus consisted of a clear plexiglass box measuring 50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm. The floor of the apparatus is a grey wooden platform into which four holes (3 cm in diameter) were cut 10 cm from each corner along the diagonal and the apparatus as a whole was elevated from the ground by 30 cm. Each mouse was tested once following treatment with either CNO or vehicle for a period of 10 min. Once testing began, the animals were allowed to explore the apparatus and the number of head-dips (counted only when ears are below the platform), head-dip time, number of rears, and rearing time were measured. Head dip number and time were scored manually whereas rears and rearing time were scored with ANY-maze (Stoelting) and a side-view camera.Alley running for foodThe runway consisted of a 5-cm-wide, 1-m-long platform laterally enclosed by 30 cm black wooden walls. A piece of filter paper with a one-fourth of an M&M mini was placed within 1 cm of the end of the runway. On three consecutive days mice were allowed 10 min to explore the arena and become familiar with the reward placement. On the fourth day food access was restricted. After a 24 h period, mice were then placed at the beginning of the track and the latency to complete the runway to retrieve the food reward was measured using a stopwatch.HistologyMice were transcardially perfused with PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were extracted and postfixed overnight and subsequently cryoprotected with PBS containing 30% sucrose. Coronal or sagittal 40-μm-thick sections were obtained using a cryostat (Leica, Germany). Sections were slide mounted, counterstained with DAPI (1:500), and imaged using a fluorescence microscope with a × 4.2 objective on an FSX100 fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan), or a confocal microscope with a × 20 objective on a Quorum spinning disk confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany).Statistical analysesData were analysed using two- and three-way repeated measures analysis of variances, independent-samples t-tests and paired-samples t-tests where appropriate. All the data are presented as mean±s.e., and the difference was considered significant when P<0.05. All experiments were performed by experimenters blind to treatment conditions. All analyses were conducted using Statistica v7.Data availabilityData supporting the findings of this study are available upon request.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5192165.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"P-body and Stress Granule Quantification in Caenorhabditis elegans","text":"P-body and Stress Granule Quantification in Caenorhabditis elegans\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Growth and synchronization of transgenic C. elegans population1.  When working with a transgenic strain with integrated genetic array (Table 1), use a sterile pipette tip (200u//) to cut a small chunk (0.5×0.5:cm) ) of agar containing animals from an older plate and transfer it to a freshly Escherichia coli (OP50) seeded NGM plate (see Recipes). When working with a transgenic line with a non-integrated extrachromosomal array, pick 25 L4 larvae or adult transgenic animals based on the selection-marker to a freshly OP50 seeded NGM plate.2.  Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of ^20^°C .3.  3.5 days later the plates contain a mixed population of larval stages.4.  Synchronize nematodes by picking 30 transgenic animals in L4 stage under a dissecting stereomicroscope and transfer them onto separate OP50 seeded plates. The L4 stage can be identified based on the presence of a half-moon shaped light structure in the area of the vulva and the relative size of the animal (Figure 1).5.  Grow the animals for 24~h at ^20^°C into day 1 adults and proceed with mounting the sample (Procedure B).()Figure 1. Identification of C. elegans larval stages in a mixed population. The image depicts all 4 larval stages, young adult and day 1 adult as seen under a dissecting stereomicroscope. The arrow indicates the half-moon shaped structure in the area of the vulva, which is indicative for the L4 larval stage.B.  Mounting animals for imaging1.  Prepare fresh 5% agarose pads (see Recipes).2.  Pipette 3ul polystyrene beads suspension in the center of the agarose pad.3.  Use a platinum wire to pick 30 transgenics from the OP50 seeded plates into the polystyrene bead suspension.4.  Gently place a coverslip on top of the agarose/worm suspension and proceed with the imaging procedure. Optionally, the agarose pads can be sealed with nail polish, which will retain humidity for long-term (>3h) imaging.5.  Animals can be recovered from unsealed plates by gently lifting one edge of the coverslip with the help of a scalpel and adding 10ul of M9 buffer to suspend the worms. Subsequently, worms can be transferred with an eyelash to OP50-seeded NGM plates.C.  Imaging P body/SG number with an epifluorescence light microscope1.  Start up the light microscope and imaging software (ZEN, Zeiss).2.  Place the agarose pad on the imaging stage of the fluorescent light microscope and locate the animals. Use a 10x objective to image the whole animal.3.  Use the DIC channel to focus on an anatomical landmark. Most appropriate are the grinder and the lumen of the pharynx, which are located in the most central transverse (horizontal) position within the animal (Figure 2A).4.  Change to the fluorescent channel to visualize P body or SG-specific fluorescence and define exposure time and fluorescent light intensity. These parameters depend on the transgene and have to be defined empirically. Saturation of the fluorescent signal has to be avoided by lowering exposure time and/or fluorescent light intensity. However, too short exposure might result in# bio-protocollowered sensitivity of detecting RNP granules (Figure 2B). For transgenes that co-express various reporters for P bodies/SGs repeat this step in the corresponding fluorescent channel.5.  Once the best imaging conditions are determined, take a snapshot of all fluorescent channels and the DIC channel. Take images of at least 25 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.6.  Save the data as an image stack. Zeiss microscopes produce *.czi file formats, which can be processed by ImageJ/Fiji freeware (see Data analysis). However, images can also be stored/exported and further processed in any other common format including *.jpg, *.png, *.tiff, etc., and then proceed with the data analysis.()Figure 2.

Choose the polygon selection tool to surround the whole animal. Open Analyze > Measure to get area size and MPI. (Full genotype of transgenic animal: N2;Expdcap-1DCAP-1::dsRED; pRF4 published in Rieckher et al., 2015.)D.  Imaging P body/SG number, dynamics and colocalization with a confocal microscope1.  Start up the confocal microscope and corresponding imaging software.2.  Activate the appropriate laser(s) for fluorescent detection of P body/SG reporters.3.  Locate the animal through the eyepiece with a 10x objective using transmission light and center the field of view on the area of interest (e.g., the pharynx).4.  Upon localization, switch to the 40× objective and readjust the focus.5.  In the confocal operating software (acquisition) design a protocol for a z-stack scan. a.  Different RNP granules significantly vary in size and intensity across different transgenes and within samples (Teixeira et al., 2005). Hence, a balance has to be established empirically between laser power and gain (voltage of photomultiplier tubes PMTs/detectors) to set the highest and lowest detection limit. If available, use the Smart Setup as a starting point. Try to avoid overexposure but test the lower detection limit by stepwise increasing laser power and/or gain. The final settings have to be reproducibly applied to all samples.For the example in Figure 2 we use the tunable laser at 570 n m (excitation dsRED), laser power 3% , and Master gain 580.b.  Keep the pinhole size for an optimal section thickness at 1 AU.c.  The distance between z-stacks (slices) should be maximum 1.5 um . Decreasing z-stack distance might enhance the capability to detect smaller RNP granules but increases photobleaching. Cover a similar volume in each scanned sample. We perform 30 z-stacks at 1.5um across the pharyngeal region (Figures 2 and 3).d.  Assign the frame size (resolution). We use 1024×1024 (Figures 2 and 3).e.  Use the transmitted light detector (T-PMT) to produce a DIC/Brightfield image in parallel (optional).6.  Once the best imaging conditions are determined, perform a scan of the fluorescent channel. When imaging different P bodies/SGs co-expressed in the same transgene use sequential scan for additional fluorescent channels. Take datasets of at least 15 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.7.  Upon completion of the scan use the processing mode of the ZEN software to produce a maximum intensity projection (MIP), summarizing the fluorescence intensity of all stacks in one image (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistently save as *.czi file or other image file format. Proceed with data analysis. Alternatively, single stacks or subsets of stacks can be processed and analyzed.()Figure 3 Representative images of the pharyngeal region of an adult transgenic animal expressing the P body reporter DCAP-1::dsRED and the SG reporter IFE-2::GFP.

Opn mutant congenic mice (B6(Cg)-Spp1tm1Blh/J) backcrossed 10 times to a C57BL/6 genetic background [68], were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and are abbreviated C57BL/6−/− in the manuscript. All mice were bred under specific pathogen–free conditions, in the animal facility of Institut Pasteur, and littermates destined to be inoculated with L. amazonensis parasites were randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups and housed in the A3 animal facility. All experimental protocols were ethically approved by the Institutional Committees on Animal Welfare at Institut Pasteur (CETEA n°: 2013–0014) and conducted under strict accordance with the European guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU) for animal care and use. EM is authorized to perform experiments on vertebrates from the Paris Department of Veterinary Services, (DDSV) and she was responsible for all experiments conducted personally or under her supervision under strict consideration of the animal welfare ethics rules.Anesthesia and euthanasiaAnesthesia procedures are as described in the next paragraph section.Animals used for the experimental procedures in this work were euthanized by carbon dioxide (CO2) delivery from a compressed CO2 gas cylinder directly in the animals’ home cage to reduce stress, as recommended. Euthanasia was accomplished by slow exposure to increasing levels of CO2, displacing approximately 10–30% of the cage volume per minute, outside the animals’ housing room. Flow was kept for 2 min and the animals were maintained in the same cage for five additional minutes. Animals were bred taking in consideration the animal numbers necessary for our studies. However when this was necessary remaining animals were euthanized using the same procedure as described. For RNA preparations animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after light anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of Pentobarbital (50 mg/kg).Preparation and inoculation of L. amazonensis parasitesLeishmania amazonensis strain LV79 (WHO reference: MPRO/BR/72/M1841) was used for parasite preparation under experimental procedures previously described [69–71]. In brief, 106 wild type LV79 amastigotes were injected subcutaneously in the hind footpad of Swiss nude mice. Lesions containing the parasites were excised 2 months after and purified, as described [69, 72]. LV79 at the amastigote developmental stage were used to inoculate BMFs cultures at a MOI (Multiplicity of infection) of 4:1. LV79 metacyclic promastigotes were prepared from amastigotes carrying the firefly luciferase gene into the 18S rRNA locus of the nuclear DNA of Leishmania amazonensis LV79 strain [69]. After the initial amastigote differentiation into promastigote, parasites were grown at 26 °C in supplemented M199 medium, as previously described [73]. Mammalian infective-stage metacyclic promastigotes were isolated from 6 days stationary phase cultures using a discontinuous density gradient [74]. Increased yield (≥95%) of metacyclic promastigotes was obtained as demonstrated by percentage counts after fixation and Giemsa coloration of the parasites [75, 76], as well as by RTqPCR for the presence of sherp transcripts (E. Giraud under review). Ten thousand metacyclic promastigotes into 10 μl of PBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline) were injected in the ear dermis of C57BL/6+/+, C57BL/6−/− and DBA/2 mice as previously described [11, 77]. The mice were anesthetized by administration of ketamine (120 mg/kg Imalgène 1000, Merial, France) and xylazine (4 mg/kg; Rompun 2%, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) by intraperitoneal injection. Each mouse was tagged at the collateral ear for identification. Clinical phenotypes were evaluated as the range of the lesion size on the site of inoculation and compared to the non-inoculated contra-lateral ear as previously described [69], by a direct reading using Vernier calliper (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) and expressed as ear thickness.Bone marrow-derived macrophages generation and infectionsMacrophages were differentiated from bone marrow cells isolated from the tibia and femurs of 6–8-weeks-old C57BL/6+/+, C57BL/6−/− and DBA/2 mice as previously described [29, 72]. In brief, bone marrow cells were suspended in PBS-Dulbecco, Ca++, and Mg++ on ice. After centrifugation (300 g, 10 min, 4 °C) and red blood cell elimination with NH4CL 0.87%, pellets were re-suspended in complete DMEM medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 10% FCS, 50u/μg Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were counted and put in culture in the presence of rm-CSF-1 (ImmunoTools) at a density of 7.5 × 106 cells/100 mm Falcon dish and placed at 37 °C (94% air, 7.5% CO2). On day 7, macrophages were inoculated with the Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes (strain LV79), freshly isolated from footpad lesions of Swiss nude mice as previously described [78], at a MOI 4:1 (parasites: MF). Cell cultures were then incubated at 34 °C for 24 or 48 h and cells were lysed for total RNAs preparation or placed on glass micro slides for fluorescent immunostaining with antibodies against LAMP-1, osteopontin and Leishmania. For evaluation of intracellular and extracellular OPN protein concentrations, by Western blot and Elisa assay differentiated BMF cells were infected with axenic amastigotes as described [29]. For these experiments the LV78 strain (MPRP/BR/72/M1845) was used, belonging to the same complex of L. amazonensis than the LV79 strain. For the generation of axenic amastigotes, parasites were subjected to host-free differentiation conditions by simultaneous pH (7.4 to 5.5) and temperature (26 °C to 34 °C) shift of the fully supplemented M199 in the presence of 20% FBS and titrated to pH 5.5 with succinic acid as previously described [37] and allowed to differentiate for 7 days. At 24 h, and 48 h post infection, the culture medium was removed and kept for the ELISA assay. For the Western blot analysis cells were washed three times with 4 ml PBS and lysed in 200 μl RIPA buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. To note that the permissive temperature for the surviving and multiplication of the L. amazonensis amastigotes is 34 °C [79], similar to the dermis temperature on the sites of parasite infection by the sandfly (lower than the body’s 37 °C).SDS PAGE and immunoblottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed by the method of Laemmli (1970) [80]. For immunoblotting, 15 μg of protein extracts were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and once electrophoresis completed, proteins were transferred on a nitrocellulose filter (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblotting was performed with the use of ECL Plus (enhanced chemiluminescence) (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. OPN and actin were detected sequentially after stripping the blot for 10 min RT with stripping buffer (200 mM glycine, 1% SDS, pH 2.5). Goat anti-mouse OPN antibody (AF808, R&D Biosystems) was used at a dilution of 1:750 in TBS buffer. Donkey anti-goat IgG (H&L, ab205723, Abcam) Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated was used as a secondary Ab at a dilution 1:10000. Anti-actin Antibody (MAB 1501, clone C4, Merck, Millipore) at a 1:2000 dilution was used for detection of the actin protein and a goat anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) secondary Antibody (0.8 mg/ml), HRP conjugate (Invitrogen) at 1:10000 dilution.Quantification of secreted OPN by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Secreted OPN was evaluated in the media from BMF cells infected or non-infected with Leishmania amazonensis parasites by a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay method using the Quantikine mouse osteopontin ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Cat N° MOST00) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, a polyclonal mouse OPN specific antibody is pre-coated onto a microplate. Samples, standards and controls are added into the wells and mouse OPN present is bound on the immobilized antibody. Following 2 h incubation at room temperature, unbound substances are washed and an enzyme-linked mouse OPN specific polyclonal antibody is added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After removing any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent by five series of washes, a substrate solution is added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The enzyme reaction yields a blue color that turns yellow after adding the STOP solution. The color intensity corresponding to the amount of mouse OPN bound in the initial step was read at OD 450 with a correction wavelength set at 570 nm in an absorbance microplate Reader ELx800™. Standard curve was prepared by reconstitution of mouse OPN Standard (2500 pg/ml) following by serial dilutions at 8 concentrations in total, from 2500 pg/ml to 39 pg/ml, and 0 pg/ml. Samples were serially diluted to 1:3, 1:9, 1:27, to 1:81 in the buffer provided in the kit. All buffers used are as described and supplied in the kit (https://www.rndsystems.com/products/mouse-rat-osteopontin-opn-quantikine-elisa-kit_most00).The ELISA scores of the samples were submitted to a quantitative analysis using a Four Parameter Logistic (4PL) curve-fit suitable for calculating concentrations from symmetrical sigmoidal calibrators as described (https://www.myassays.com/four-parameter-logistic-curve.assay). The standard data points (concentration vs. measurement) are plotted on log-log axes and a 4PL is made through the points. The concentrations of the samples are determined taking in consideration the specific dilution factors applied.Flow cytometry of macrophage-restricted markersThe differentiation of macrophages from the bone marrow progenitors isolated from the DBA/2, C57BL/6+/+ and opn mutant, C57BL/6−/− mice were examined by Flow cytometry for the coordinated expression of monocyte/macrophage lineage specific gene expression of surface molecules including CD11b, CD115, CD11c (cluster of differentiation), MHC-II and the F4/80 antigen expressed by the Lymphocyte antigen (Ly-71), using the corresponding antibodies [81, 82]. Flow cytometry was performed on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and the data were analysed using the Kaluza software package (Beckman Coulter) as previously described [72]. All three strains of mice showed similar cell surface molecules designating the macrophage lineage as follows: macrophage lineage-specific: CD11bHigh F4/80High, CD115High, while surface-specific markers for the dendritic cell (DC) lineage, were negative or low (CD11c−, MHC-IILow) (Additional file 1: Figure S1).In vivo luciferase-expressing L. amazonensis bioluminescence imagingAnimals were followed for clinical phenotypes (usually weekly) and parasite proliferation at different time points after infection, ranging from Day 16 to Day 100. Parasite loads were evaluated by bioluminescence imaging as previously described [69]. In brief, mice were given a solution of the luciferase substrate luciferin (i.p. 150 mg/kg, D-Luciferin potassium salt, SYNCHEM OHG, Germany). 25 min following luciferin injection mice were anaesthetized for 5 min in a 2.5% isoflurane atmosphere (Aerane, Baxter SA, Maurepas, France) and then placed into the imaging chamber (IVIS™ Imaging System 100 series, Xenogen). Emitted photons acquisition from the sites of inoculation (regions of interest, ROI) was acquired by a charge-coupled device camera delimiting the surface of the entire ear pinna. The same ROI was examined for all mice at all time points. Total photon emission was expressed in photons/sec/ROI. Median bioluminescence values and SD were calculated for each experimental group. At designated time points post inoculation, 3 representative mice from each group selected for their median bioluminescence and SD values, similar to the entire corresponding group were sacrificed and ear pinnae and draining lymph nodes were removed for further process of total RNA extraction or for histology [77]. Contralateral tissues non-injected and control mice groups were analysed in parallel.Immunofluorescence labelling of BMFsBone marrow derived macrophages were placed on glass slides (CML France) in 24 wells plates and inoculated or not with L. amazonensis amastigotes (MOI 4:1). Cell cultures were placed at 34 °C (94% air, 7.5% CO2) for 24 h and 48 h. Culture media were then removed and cells were washed with 1 ml 1xPBS (Dulbecco) without Mg++ and Ca++ at 34 °C. Cells were fixed on glass slides with 1 ml /well 4% parafolmahedyde (PFA) in PBS pH 7.4 for 1 h at room temperature, permeabilized with saponin (25 mg/ml). Incubation with the primary antibodies was as follows: 10 μg/ml of the amastigote specific mAb 2A3–26-biot, and anti-OPN (goat IgG) 7 μg/ml (R&D Systems, France) or LAMP-1/CD107a monoclonal antibody specific for the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) of the parasitophorous vacuole (rat IgG2a FITC, Invitrogen, CA). Revelation was performed with 1.5 μg/ml streptavidin conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Cergy Pontoise, France) for the Leishmania parasites, with donkey anti-goat FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorochrome, sc2024, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for osteopontin and donkey anti-rat-FITC (LS-C351178, CliniSciences, FR) for LAMP-1. The incubation at room temperature was for 30 min with the first antibodies and after three washes with PBS/saponin, 30 min with the secondary antibodies. Glass slides were then mounted with Hoechst 33342-containing Mowiol 4.88 (Calbiochem). Hoechst labelling of the DNA allowed visualization of both host cell and amastigote nuclei. Epifluorescence microscopy signals were detected with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright microscope monitored by the Zeiss AxioVision Rel. 4.8.2 image acquisition software (Carl Zeiss International). Mean protein densities were annotated using the digital high quality images acquired by the AxioVision software tool. An average of 10 different cells were analysed in at least three different fields. Values are expressed in density units/msec of 20μm2 opn stained areas/cell. Statistical analyses are performed with the Mann Whitney test.For the phenotypic measurements of the BMFs we have used multidimentional acquisition of at least 4 different microscopy fields, using the MosaiX application (40x magnification) which permits to scan large areas of the slides creating a digital image. This enhanced quality image serves to navigate the samples and provides a basis for the analysis.HistopathologyEar pinna and the draining lymph nodes were sampled, fixed in 4% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin and 5 μm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Each microscopic change: ulceration (i.e. breach of the continuity of skin, with sloughing out of inflamed necrotic tissue), acanthosis (i.e. hyperplasia and thickening of the epidermis), necrosis (i.e. mass of eosinophilic tissue and cell debris replacing the epidermis or dermis), oedema (i.e. collection of pale fluid within the interstitium) and presence of parasites were scored semi-quantitatively using a five-scale scoring system (1: minimal, 2: mild; 3: moderate, 4: marked, 5; severe). Median values were compared between inoculated sections and control contralateral tissues. Immunostaining with anti-OPN (AF808, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and anti-F4/80 macrophage-specific antibodies (MAB 5580, R&D systems) was also performed to estimate neutrophils and macrophages infiltration.RNA and DNA extractionRNA preparation was performed in tissues isolated from three representative mice at various time points [77]. Ears and draining lymph nodes were fragmented with the Precellys 24 System and total RNAs were prepared with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, SAS, France) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 5 × 106 BMFs were lysed by a tissue grinder with sterile pellet pestle mixer (Kontes, Thomas Scientific) and total RNAs were extracted with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer. RNA quantification and quality evaluation was done by measurement of Optical Density in a Nanodrop ND-1000 micro-spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) [83]. DNAs were isolated from tissues or from amastigotes using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) under the manufacturer’s protocol.Real-time quantitative PCRReverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNAs to first strand cDNA was done using random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics) and the MMLV-RT reverse transcriptase (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, Invitrogen Life Technologies). Relative quantification of the genes of interest was performed in a final volume of 10 μl per reaction in white ultraAmp 384 well PCR plates (Sorenson, Bioscience, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) on a LightCycler® 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Briefly, 1 μl of cDNA or DNA was added to 9 μl of a master mix containing 5 μl of SYBR Green (QuantiTect SYBR Green Kit, Qiagen) and 4 μl of nucleases-free water with primers at a final concentration of 0.5 μM (Guaranteed Oligos™, Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR program included 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 54 °C for 25 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. SYBR Green fluorescent emission was measured at the end of the elongation step. Crossing Point values (Cp) were determined by the second derivative maximum method of the LightCycler® 480 Basic Software. Raw Cp values were used as input for qBase program for Biogazelle qBase program for qPCR data management and analysis [84]. For normalization eleven candidate control genes including g6pd, gapdh, h6pd, hprt, ldha, nono, pgk1, rpl19, rpIIe, tbp and ywhaz were tested with the geNorm [85] and Normfinder programs [86]. Hprt (hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) and ywhaz were the most consistently expressed in the BMFs and were selected as reference genes for the normalization of the gene expression levels. Ldha and nono were selected as the most stable reference genes for the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 lymph nodes. The primer sequences used were as follows: i) reference genes: hprt F- (5’-ATTAGCGATGATGAACCAG-3′), R- (5’-CTTGAGCACACAGAGGG-3′); ywhaz F- (5’-GTTACTTGGCCGAGGT-3′), R- (5’-GGAGTTCAGGATCTCGT-3′); ldha F- (5’-TCCTGGTGTGACTGGG-3′), R- (5’-CCAATAACGGCCACAAG-3′); nono F- (5’-AAAGCAGTTAGAACTCAGG-3′), R- (5’-GGCCCATCCGTATCTC-3′); tbp F- (5’-CCTATGACCCCTATCACT-3′), R- (5’-GTCCGTGGCTCTCTTAT-3′); ii) target genes: spp1 (FL-opn) F-: (5’-TCTGATGAGACCGTCACTGC-3′), R- (5’-CCTCAGTCCATAAGCCAAGC-3′); i-opn F- (5’-GCCTGTTTGGCATTGCCTCCTC-3′), R- (5’-CACAGCATTCTGTGGCGCAAGG-3′); CD44 F (5’-TATCTCCCGGACTGAGG-3′), R- (5’-AGGCATTGAAGCAATATGT-3′); casp3 F- (5’-AGCTTTGTGTGTGTGAT-3′), R- (5’-CTGTCTGTCTCAATGCC-3′); pycard F- (5’-TGCTTAGAGACATGGGC-3′), R- (5’-CCACTTCTGTGACCCT-3′); nod2 F- (5’-AACAAACTCACGGATGC-3′), R- (5’-CCTTATCACCCACGCT-3′); naip5 F- (5’-CATCCGGGTGAAGAGG-3′), R- (5’-GGGAACCACTTGGCAT-3′); il-1β F-(5’-AGGCAGGCAGTATCAC-3′), R- (5’-CACACCAGCAGGTTATC-3′) casp1 F-(5’-ATCTGTATTCACGCCCT-3′), R- (5’-TGCTTCCTCTTTGCCC-3′); nlrp3 F- (5’-GACTTTGGAATCAGATTGCT-3′), R- (5’-GGGTCCTTCATCTTTTCAC-3′); nlrc4 F- (5’-AACTGGATTGCTTGGC-3′), R- (5’-AGTCAAAGCGTCCCAC-3′). The relative expressions of the opn gene and of the genes implicated in the inflammasome multicomplex were calculated as the n-fold difference in expression in the Leishmania infected BMFs in comparison with gene expression values from Leishmania unexposed cultures. Similarly, the evaluation of the inflammasome gene expression in the ear lesions was expressed as a ratio of transcript levels in the C57BL/6 −/− mice versus the wild type C57BL/6+/+ ear lesions, both inoculated in vivo with the parasites. Leishmania parasites were quantified with the gene target primers (ssrRNA) F- CCATGTCGGATTTGGT and R- CGAAACGGTAGCCTAGAG [11].Statistical analysisParasites numbers and parasite comparative quantification in the BMF cells are evaluated by “Mean parasite intensity” referring to the arithmetic mean of the number of individual parasites per infected host. Non-infected cells are not taken in consideration. “Prevalence” refers to the percentage of infected hosts and thus provides information of the relative sizes of the host cells in the study (infected and uninfected). In contrast, “crowding” is defined as the intensity from the parasite’s point of view. Mathematically, while “mean host intensity” is the sum of parasites per infected hosts, “mean crowding” is the sum of the crowding values (parasites living in a host) divided by the number of parasites [87]. In other words “Mean crowding” describes intensity values averaged across parasite individuals and represents the value of the number of parasites that they can live in a host cell [88]. Parasite quantification and comparisons of parasite loads, mean intensity and parasite crowding between macrophages from C5BL/6+/+ and C57BL/6 opn−/− strains were performed using the Quantitative Parasitology (QP3.0) statistical software tool [53]. Comparison of mean intensities was done by a Bootstrap Test [89]. Density dependent character of parasites was described by Crowding, taking p-values at Cl (Confidence limit 95%) [89]. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare transcript relative expression between macrophages from C5BL/6+/+ and C57BL/6−/− BMFs. The p values were calculated with a Mann-Whitney test to compare ear bioluminescence, ear width, and the transcript relative expression obtained by RTqPCR between the control group and the group inoculated with parasites (*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.001; ***: p < 0.0001).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6368773.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Electroporation of Embryonic Chick Eyes","text":"Electroporation of Embryonic Chick Eyes\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Chicken egg manipulation and incubationWilmington) (Note 1) or White Leghorn chicken eggs (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) are stored at room temperature up to 5 days without significant decrease in viability 80-85% viability) or defects in development (Note 2).2.  Before incubating the eggs, check the conditions of the incubator (Note 3).3.  For electroporations in the eye, we incubate the eggs approximately 35~h~ for Stages8-9 (seven somites, the anterior neural folds closes to form the neural tube), 38 h for Stage 10 (ten somites, optic vesicles not constricted at bases), 48 h for Stage 12 (sixteen somites, optic vesicle and optic stalk established), 72h for Stage 14 (optic vesicle evaginated and lens-placode present) or 4.5 days for Stage 22 eye pigmented, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and neuroepithelium well established (Note 4).()Figure 2. Stage 8-12 electrodes set up. Two isolated Pt/Ir electrodes with Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 m m of free tip (a) are bent as is indicated (b). Thereafter, the bent electrodes are inserted into a small plastic holder (made from a 20ul pipet tip) with 2 mm diameter (c1) and 3 m m length (c2) keeping at the tip 1.5m m in between (c). The electrodes are inserted into the holder made of Stainless Steel Tube (SST) and Resin Rod (RR) that has been modified with a press fit (d). Carefully, electrodes are permanently attached to the holder using epoxy. It is critical to keep the shape and 1.5~m m distance between the electrodes during this procedure (e). Finally, the Pt/Ir electrodes are connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator.()Figure 3. Stage 19-26 electrodes set up. One Gold plated thick electrode (anode +^ ' ) is isolated with tygon microbore tubing (a). One Pt/Ir microelectrode (cathode -) is isolated using Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 mm of free tip (see Figure 2a) and inserted into a glass capillary tube and sealed with epoxy (b), that can be alternatively protected with a 1ml pipet tip. The assembled electrodes are then connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator (c).# B.  Electroporations at Stages 8-12a.  Fertilized eggs are incubated horizontally on their sides so the embryo can be properly positioned for electroporation (Figure 4a). If electroporation is planned for more than one dozen, we strongly suggest to space out the incubation times for each dozen in order to have enough time to electroporate the next dozen at the same developmental stage. This is particularly critical for Stages 8 to 12. Once the embryos reach the desired Stage (approximately 38 h for Stage 10, see Chicken egg manipulation and incubation), proceed to open the eggs according with the instructions provided in the Video 1 (steps B1e-h below). It takes about 2 min to open each egg. The electroporation can be made immediately after opening the egg, however if you have enough experience opening the eggs you can open one dozen in about 25 min and then proceed with the electroporation immediately.b.  Once the eggs reach the desired stage, place them in a carton and at room temperature for about 10 min. This incubation is necessary to facilitate the contraction of the inner shell membrane and promotes the separation from the outer shell membrane to generate the air sack.c.  Keeping their horizontal position, place the eggs in a small incubator (e,g., HOVA-BATOR) previously calibrated at 37-39 ^°C (99 to 103 ^°F ) and relative humidity of 50-55% .d.  With a bright light source, candle the egg and mark the area where the embryo is located, usually the embryo is located in the top part of the yolk (on the top of the horizontal section of the shell).e.  Mark the air sack that is located between the outer and inner membranes of the egg.f.  Pierce the shell at the top of the air sack using blunt ended forceps or a syringe with a large bore needle.g.  Carefully, introduce a fine probe to move the air sack to the top part of the egg, this is possible by gently touching down to lower the inner shell membrane (Figure 4b-c) (Note 5).h.  Using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (Figure 4d) (Video 1 provides visual information of the steps B1e-h) and add 200~ul of HBSS. Close the window using transparent tape and return the egg to the incubator. Discard the embryos older than the desired stage. If the embryos have not reached the desired stage, they can be incubated for an additional time.Variations on the embryonic stage in which the electroporation is performed will produce inconsistency on the results and interpretation.()Figure 4. Preparing eggs for electroporation. Fertilized eggs are incubated in horizontal position (a). After localizing the air sack and the chick embryo, a fine probe is introduced to move the air sack to the top part of the egg. This is possible by gently touching and lowering the inner shell membrane (b, c). Finally, using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (d).i. Optionally, to enhance the contrast and visualize the embryo at Stages 8-12, inject 100~ul of Indian ink solution diluted in HBSS using a 1 ml syringe and a 25-26 gauge needle underneath the embryo.j.  Repeat steps B1e-h for the rest of the eggs until the dozen is completed.()Video 1. Preparing the eggs for electroporation# 2.  Embryo electroporationa.  Adjust the nitrogen tank to 80 psi.b.  Attach the beveled glass capillary needle to the stainless steel pipette holder of the microinjector (Figure 1c).c.

For studies in which the RCAS replication-competent ASLV long terminal repeat (LTR) with a Splice acceptor virus system will be used, we strongly recommend to use Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) eggs. These eggs have been certified to be pathogen free  of  avian  sarcoma-leukosis  virus  (ASLV).  For  additional  information  see http://www.criver.com/, and a detailed study of endogenous expression of ASLV viral proteins has been published by McNally et al. (2010).2.  Temperatures below 4^°C are detrimental so special care is advised during shipping in winter season.3.  Eggs are incubated in a rotating incubator (45 angle rotation every hour) at 37-39^°C (99 to 103 ^°F_. ) and relative humidity of 50-55% . The incubation times and embryo stages could vary depending on the type of incubator, temperature and humidity, therefore the incubation times for specific embryonic stages should be determined empirically in each laboratory (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951).4.  Before performing the electroporation, make sure the embryo is at the desired stage, be aware of some characteristics such as number of somites, optic vesicle, lens-vesicle and eye pigmentation. Small differences in the stage of electroporation can result in tremendous differences in phenotypes. In some cases, an injection of Indian ink could be necessary in order to visualize the embryo and to familiarize with the structures (see step B1i of electroporations at Stages 8-12).5.  Be gentle when introducing the probe and avoid damage of the inner membranes of the egg. If you notice leaking of albumin is very probable that the embryo will die.6.  Ensure that the plasmid or RCAS constructs are of high quality. DNA constructs are amplified using commercial kits e.g., PureYield™ Plasmid Maxiprep System or Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Prep™ and dissolved in TE buffer (see TE buffer in the solutions section). We recommend dissolving the DNA at concentrations between 3.0-5.0~u/ulfor plasmids and 200n g/ul for RCAS constructs and store at -20~^°C for short-term use or at -80~^°C for long-term storage. Avoid using samples of DNA containing traces of Phenol or ethanol and high concentration of salts, since they could be detrimental for the  viability  of  the  embryo.  Determine  the  concentration  of  DNA  using  a spectrophotometer  or  a  Nanodrop.  Alternatively,  the  concentration  could  be determined using SYBR Green I dsDNA assay. The ratio of absorbance 260/280 will give you an idea about the purity of DNA vs protein or other contaminants and secondary  measurement  could  be  260/230  (phenol  carbohydrates  and  have absorbance  close  to  230nm)  (see  technical  support  bulletin  at http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/gcat/protocols/NanoDrop_tip.pdf). A ratio of 1.8 or above for 260/280 ratio or 2.0-2.2 for 260/230 are considered good quality DNA. Always verify the integrity of the DNA by electrophoresis. Quantification is not enough to ensure that your DNA is of good quality. For first time users, it is advisable to use plasmids containing a reporter gene such as GFP to evaluate the efficiency of electroporation, for example pCAG-GFP or pEGFP-N1. Additionally, in order to track the expression of your gene of interest it is recommendable to design your constructs to include an IRES-GFP sequence or an alternative way to identify the electroporated areas. To prepare the electroporation solution, mix 9.0~ul of plasmid (3.0-5.0~u9/uI) or RCAS-contruct (200n g/ul) with 1~ul of 0.05% Fast Green dye.7.  Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides are designed to down regulate gene expression.  They  can  be  designed  and  ordered  from  GeneTools  LLC (http://www.gene-tools.com/). In order to trace the electroporated cells, the MOs must be tagged at the acute° -end (e.g., carboxyfluorescein). MO have minimal off-target effects but it is recommendable to use at least two different MOs (e.g., to block translation and splice junctions) in order to observe the same phenotypic effects. Additionally, it is necessary to use a control MO and/or scrambled sequence of the target mRNA. The main disadvantages of using MOs is that they are very expensive and sometimes it is necessary to test more than two sequences in order to find the right MO to efficiently down regulate gene expression. Moreover, during cell division, MOs are diluted so they are inefficient for long term (more than 4 days) and in some cases they are practically  undetectable  after  72  h  of  electroporation  and  in  such  cases  the fluorescence signal needs to be detected using an antibody against fluorescein. MOs are dissolved at 1 mM concentration using sterile Ringer’s solution and stored at room temperature in the original container and kept in the dark. According with Gene Tools, MOs can precipitate at low temperatures and lose their efficiency, so they need to be resuspended again before use. During electroporation, MOs can migrate slightly towards the anode (+) possibly because of the fluorescein that is negatively charged. In order to increase the efficiency of MO electroporation, it is advisable to use 0.5u of DNA (e.g., non-biologically active plasmid). To prepare the electroporation solution, mix and heat an aliquot of 10ul at 65^°C for 10m i n to re-dissolve the precipitates. It isnot recommendable to use fast green since it can inhibit the electroporation (Kos et al.,2013). The injection of the carboxyfluorescein-tagged morpholino can be visualized using a blue dichroic filter attached to a regular fiber optic lamp.8.  We provided the list of parts necessary to set up Stage-8-12 and Stage-19-26 electrodes, notice that some of the parts listed could be the same.9.  You will see gentle bubbling on the electrodes after pushing the electroporator footswitch, (the bubbling is an indication that the system is working properly).# Recipes1.  Ringer’s solutiona.

Human neural progenitor ReN VM cells were from MilliporeSigma (catalog number SCC008, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). IMR-32 cells were maintained in DMEM (catalog number 11995-073, Life Technologies, Burlington, ON) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (catalog number 10082139, Thermo Fischer Scientific), and 1% GlutaMax (catalog number 35050061, Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

ReN VM cells were differentiated into co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes in DMEM/F12, supplemented with 2% N21-MAX, 2 ng/ml glial-derived neurotrophic factor (catalog number PHC7045, Gibco), and 500 μM dibutyryl-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (catalog number D0627-250MG, Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described29. ReN MAPT−/− cells were generated using a paired Cas9 nickase design based on two gRNAs with the sequences ‘atcacttcgaactcctggcg’ and ‘cacgctgggacgtacgggtt’. The gRNAs were designed using CRISPR design tool (crispr.mit.edu) and selected based on high specificity scores and proximity to the ATG start codon site. ReN cells were plated in 6-well plates at 337,500 cells/well 24 h before being transfected with EditPro. The ratio of plasmids used was 6 Cas9 nickase: 1 gRNA: 1 gRNA for a total of 2 ug DNA and 4 ul of EditPro transfection reagent. Cells were expanded and diluted for clonal selection.Two clones, validated by genetic sequencing and western blotting, were isolated.For inhibition of ATPase function in non-muscle myosin heavy chains, cells were treated with 10 μM of active (S)-Blebbistatin (catalog number 13013-1, Cedarlane, Burlington, ON) or the inactive (R)-Blebbistatin enantiomer (catalog number 13165-1, Cedarlane) for 2 h.The study did not involve human subjects. All animal work was undertaken in accordance with an animal use protocol (number 4183.4) approved by the animal care committee at the University Health Network, Toronto, ON. Transgenic Tau P301L mice with strain name Thy1-hTau.P301L and non-transgenic mice used were both of FVB/N genetic background and sacrificed at 2 years of age. Mouse brain lysates were collected in 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog number 11836170001, Roche Canada, Mississauga, ON) and 1x PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (catalog number 4906837001, Roche). The lysates were then homogenized with three 1-minute long pulses of bead-beating with 1 min of cooling at 4 °C between each pulse. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C.Plasmid preparationsAll site-directed mutagenesis and polymerase chain reactions were performed with the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix kits, respectively (catalog numbers E0554S and M0494S, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). All ligation reactions were performed with the T4 DNA ligase (catalog number M0202S, New England Biolabs) after vector backbones had been dephosphorylated with Fast AP thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (catalog number EF0651, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All plasmids were transformed into 5-alpha Competent E. coli (catalog number C2987H, New England Biolabs). All plasmids were purified using the PureLink HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep Kit (catalog number K2100-16, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The foundation lox construct and the inducible construct were derived from a pre-existing ‘Puro-Cas9’ donor vector for targeting a tetracycline-inducible Cas9 cassette to the human AAVS1/PPP1R12C locus (catalog number 58409, Addgene, Cambridge, MA, RRID:Addgene_58409). The Flpo construct was derived from the pDIRE plasmid (catalog number 26745, Addgene, RRID:Addgene_26745) and the paavCAG-iCre construct was purchased directly (catalog number 51904, Addgene, RRID:Addgene_51904). The donor vectors were originally gifts from Danwei Huangfu52, Rolf Zeller53, and Jinhyn Kim54, respectively.gRNAsThe gRNAs were cloned into the MLM3636 vector (a gift from Keith Joung, catalog number 43860, Addgene, RRID:Addgene_43860) using BsmBI (catalog number R0580S, New England Biolabs) as previously described55. Oligonucleotide pairs used to generate gRNAs are listed (Fig. S1).Foundation cassette (FC)Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert lox71, lox2272, and frt sites, mutate gRNA PAM sequences in the homology arms, and insert unique restriction enzyme sites BbvCI and AsiSI. BbvCI (catalog number SCC008, New England Biolabs) and AsiSI (catalog number R0630S, New England Biolabs) were subsequently used to insert the KanR coding sequence in place of the PuroR coding sequence from the original vector. The KanR coding sequence was derived from the Tau1-441-EGFP plasmid (a gift from Dr. George S. Bloom)56 after it was first amplified by PCR using primers with the respective restriction sites.Inducible expression cassette (IEC)The CAG promoter and the rtTA3 coding sequence were PCR amplified from paavCAG-iCre and pTRIPZ (a gift from Drs. Christopher Boehm and Peter St George-Hyslop, University of Toronto, ON, Canada), respectively. They were ligated together using BamHI (catalog number FD0054, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reamplified by PCR to attach restriction sites BspTI (catalog number FD0834, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Bsu15I (catalog number FD0144, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively. The coding sequence of Tau-EGFP was amplified from the Tau1-441-EGFP plasmid with restriction sites BbvCI and AsiSI attached at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively, and it was cloned into the ‘Puro-Cas9’ donor backbone downstream of the TREtight sequence in place of the original Cas9. The vector, now containing Tau-EGFP, was PCR amplified to attach restriction sites BspTI and Bsu15I before it was ligated to CAG-rtTA3. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert lox66, lox2272, and frt sites, delete Tau to make the EGFP-only control construct, delete the second repeat domain in Tau to make 3 R Tau-EGFP, and to mutate CCG to CTG at residue 301 in Tau to create the TauP301L-EGFP mutant.TransfectionIMR-32 cells were trypsinized and plated at 75% confluency in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection using the jetPRIME reagent (catalog number 114-07, Polyplus, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For inserting the foundation cassette (FC) using CRISPR-Cas9 nickase gene editing, cells were transfected at a ratio of 6 Cas9n: 1 gRNA: 1 gRNA: 5 FC expressing plasmids to a total mass of 3.5 μg of plasmids per well. Cells were then selected with 1 mg/mL G418 (catalog number 11811031, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and clonally expanded. For the swap-in of the inducible expression cassette, cells were transfected at a ratio of 1 iCre: 4 IEC plasmids to a total mass of 3.0 μg/well. Cells were then selected in separate wells at a range of puromycin (P7255-25MG, Sigma-Aldrich) concentrations spanning 600 ng/ml to 1.2 μg/ml. IMR-32 cells were transfected at a ratio of 1: 3. ReN VM cells were detached with Accutase (catalog number A1110501, Gibco) and plated at 67,500 cells/well in Matrigel-coated 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells were then transfected at 250 ng DNA/well using the same ratios as above with 1 μL/well of EditPro stem transfection reagent (catalog number GST-2174, MTI-GlobalStem). For the selection of gene-edited cells, 1 mg/ml G418 (for FC positives) or 0.3 μg/ml puromycin (for IEC positives) were added to the cell culture medium and surviving cells were clonally expanded.Genomic PCRGenomic DNA was extracted from clones grown on 12-well plates using the PureLink Genomic Mini Kit (catalog number K182001, Invitrogen). Precise transgene insertion into the target site at the AAVS1 locus was determined by genomic PCR using 25 ng of genomic DNA amplified for 28 cycles using ‘ggaactctgccctctaacgc’ and ‘acccaatatcaggagactaggaagg’ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR products were purified with a gel/PCR extraction kit (catalog number DF300, Froggabio, ON, Canada). Genomic PCR of ReN MAPT−/− cells was performed with 25 ng of genomic DNA using the primer pair ‘atggagcacgggatgagga’ and ‘ccccttggcttgcagtgat’ at an annealing temperature of 66 °C for 28 cycles.ImmunoprecipitationFor immunoprecipitation of EGFP fusion proteins, inducible IMR-32 clone 27-3 cells were treated with 2.0 µg/mL doxycycline (catalog number DB0889-25G, BioBasic, ON, Canada) for durations indicated in the main text and figures before cell lysis. Inducible ReN VM cells were treated with 3.0 µg/mL doxycycline and 0.3 µg/mL puromycin for their respective durations before lysis. The lysis buffer consisted of 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog number 11836170001, Roche Canada, Mississauga, ON) and 1x PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (catalog number 4906837001, Roche). Lysate from each biological replicate was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C before incubation with 20 µL (if used for mass spectrometry analysis downstream, otherwise 7 µL per biological replicate) of agarose-conjugated GFP nanotrap slurry (catalog number gta-10, Chromotek, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) on a turning wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were then washed twice in buffer consisting of 450 mM NaCl and 150 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), once in buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl and 150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), once in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and once in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) before acid elution. Bound proteins were eluted consecutively with 100 μL and 200 μL of elution buffer comprised of 20% acetonitrile and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 1.9).For immunoprecipitation of DJ-1, cells were induced for durations indicated, collected in the aforementioned lysis buffer, centrifuged at the same settings, and incubated with 5 µL of DJ-1 antibody/biological replicate overnight on a turning wheel at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with 5 µL of Protein A sepharose beads per biological replicate (catalog number 101041, Invitrogen) for 4 h to capture the antibodies. After 3 washes in buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl and 150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), captured proteins were eluted with 1x BOLT LDS sample buffer (catalog number B0007, Invitrogen) at 70 °C.Western blotCells were lysed in the same buffer used for immunoprecipitation. After protein concentrations were determined by BCA (catalog number 23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and made equal, 35 to 75 µg total protein per lane were loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris BOLT SDS-PAGE gels (catalog number NW04125BOX, Invitrogen) in MOPS running buffer (catalog number B0001, Invitrogen). Proteins were then transferred onto a 0.45 µm PVDF membrane (catalog number IPVH00010, Millipore) at 45 V for 1 h 15 min in Tris-glycine transfer buffer containing 20% methanol. Proteins were incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then rinsed in TBST before incubation with HRP-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Chemiluminescence was detected with Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (catalog number RPN2232, GE Healthcare Canada, Mississauga, ON). Band intensities on Western blots were quantified with ImageJ (RRID: SCR_003070) and then analyzed and graphed with GraphPad Prism 7.Live cell microscopyCells were cultured on 4-well Nunc Lab-Tek II chambered cover-glass plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 67,500 cells/well and induced for 12 h with 2.0 μg/ml of doxycycline before being imaged on a Leica DMI 6000 B fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems Canada, Richmond Hill, ON).ImmunocytochemistryReN cells were grown on coverslips (catalog number 83.1840.002, Sarstedt) and differentiated using the PreD protocol for one week. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde (catalog number NC0268594, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed again twice with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (catalog number TRX506.500, Bioshop) for 5 min at room temperature. Next, cells were blocked in 3% goat serum (catalog number 16210064, Gibco) for 30 min at room temperature before being incubated with anti-TuJ1 (used at 1:500 dilution) and anti-GFAP (used at 1:500 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were rinsed three times in PBS, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Catalog number A11001, Gibco; used at 1:1000 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (catalog number A11011, Gibco; used at 1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed three times in PBS, mounted in ProLong® Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (catalog number P36965, Gibco) and imaged with 200x final magnification on a Leica DMI 6000 B fluorescence microscope using the DAPI, FITC, and TRITC filters.Peptide preparation for mass spectrometry analysesImmunoprecipitation eluates were suspended in 500 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate 9 M urea, made to 8 mM tris carboxyethyl phosphine, then heated to 60 °C for 30 min. Each sample was treated for 1 hour in 16 mM 4-vinylpyridine. Trypsin digestion (2 micrograms per sample) was allowed to proceed for 16 hours at 37 °C, then peptides were isobarically labelled with 8-plex iTRAQ reagents (catalog number 4390812, Sciex, Concord, ON) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mixed sets of iTRAQ-labelled trypsin-digested immunoprecipitates were diluted in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, then bound to C18 Bond Elut micro columns (catalog number A57003100, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), before being washed with aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and released in 50% acetonitrile. The acetonitrile was removed on a centrifugal evaporator at 36 °C and the peptides suspended in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The Titansphere Phos-TiO kit (catalog number 5010–21309, GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to purify phosphopeptides from the labelled sample mixtures. Phosphopeptide preparations were washed on C18 micro columns as described above.Quantitative mass spectrometryThe washed sample mixtures were delivered to an analytical column at 500 nL/min on an Easy-nLC 1000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by the built-in autosampler, then separated at 300 nL/min with a binary mobile phase mixture of increasing acetonitrile concentration at a constant formic acid concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Over the course of each HPLC run, the acetonitrile content of the eluent was increased with linear gradients from 0 to 30% over 180 minutes, then from 30 to 100% over 60 minutes. The PepMap RSLC C18 stationary phase was 2 μm in diameter with 100 Å pores and was housed in a 25 cm long 75 μm diameter column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The eluate was ionized at 2200 V and an ion source temperature of 275 °C by the nano-electrospray ionization source of an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).The data acquisition cycle repeated continuously over each HPLC run and had an upper time limit of three seconds. It acquired a survey scan at a resolution setting of 60,000 in the orbitrap mass analyser of the instrument, followed by collision-induced dissociation of the most abundant multiply charged ions and their analysis in the linear ion trap mass analyser. The ten most abundant product ions were then synchronously further fragmented by high-energy collision induced dissociation at a relative energy of 65% and injected into the orbitrap mass analyser for mass analysis. An additional method using Orbitrap MS2 scans at a resolution setting of 30,000 following electron transfer dissociation was applied to phosphopeptide preparations. The m/z ranges in MS and MS3 scans were 400–1500 and 100–500 Th, respectively, while the MS2 scan range was variable under the normal scan rate setting. Isolation windows for MS2 and MS3 were 2 Th wide. Each m/z value for which three ion trap MS2 scans or four Orbitrap MS2 scans were acquired within a 20 second period was excluded from MS2 analysis for 100 minutes. The minimum precursor intensity required to trigger ion trap and Orbitrap MS2 were 50,000 and 100,000 counts respectively.Protein sequence information was derived from the LC-MS data using the Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK) and Sequest HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) search engines within the Proteome Discoverer software version 1.4.0.288 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results from both algorithms were combined into a single data set, with quantifications and phosphosite estimation relying on the Reporter Ions Quantifier and PhosphoRS algorithms (version 3.0), respectively. An orthogonal search of the same LC-MS data was performed on PEAKS Studio 8 (Bioinformatics Solutions Incorporated, Waterloo, ON, Canada) using the PEAKS and De Novo search engines. For all three searches, 20 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance, 0.4 Da product ion mass tolerance, tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages and iTRAQ 8-plex labelling at lysine and amino terminal residues were fixed parameters. Glutamine and asparagine deamidation, cysteine pyridylethylation, methionine oxidation, cysteine dioxidation, cysteine trioxidation, as well as serine and tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation were specified as variable modifications in all searches. The mass shift equal to a diglycine modification of lysine side chains was the variable modification used to detect ubiquitylation. The Uniprot FASTA sequence database used contained entries for all human canonical and isoform protein variants (updated on December 20, 2015 and downloaded on March 1, 2016) as well as porcine trypsin, bovine serum albumin, Lysobacter enzymogenes Lysyl endopeptidase, 40 and 42 amino acid versions of human amyloid beta, wild-type Tau-EGFP, P301L Tau-EGFP and EGFP.Statistical analysisConfidence levels were assigned to peptide-to-spectrum matches based on false discovery rate (FDR) estimation. FDR analysis was performed on the Percolator algorithm in Proteome Discoverer and by the decoy fusion method in PEAKS. Hierarchical clustering and ANOVA were performed on the PEAKS Quantitation node. The significance of the differential abundance measurements of candidate Tau interactors in wild-type versus P301L immunoprecipitates was evaluated by ANOVA at a p-value of 0.025. Only proteins identified and quantified by three or more unique peptides were subjected to ANOVA testing. For comparing enrichment of MYH10 in eluate samples, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed on three biological replicates per condition. For comparing levels of pS19 in myosin regulatory light chains in mouse brain homogenates, unpaired t-test and Tukey’s post-hoc test were performed on results from three biological replicates per condition. The comparison of MYH10 levels in ReN VM cells that either expressed or were ablated (MAPT−/−) in their expression of endogenous Tau was based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc-test. Levels of MYH10 in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and Tau-/- mice were compared using unpaired Student’s t-test.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6838314.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Animal Models of Corneal Injury","text":"Animal Models of Corneal Injury\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: All reagents may be maintained at room temperature.\n\n1.

Set up the surgical area. a.  Place the isoflurane chamber near the microscope and place the anesthesia platform with the nose cone under the microscope objective. Place a mouse heating pad by the nose cone. b.  Place the Proparacaine, Algerbrush, weck-cels, and trephine on the lab bench near the surgical area. Have 20~ul of 1:40 diluted Fluorescein solution drawn up in a pipette (see Recipes). c.  Clean off the Algerbrush burr by rubbing with an alcohol swab.2.  Anesthetize the mouse in the isoflurane chamber. A typical approach for anesthesia involves placing the animal in an induction chamber connected to an oxygen source and isoflurane vaporizer, and adjusting oxygen flow to 0.9 liters/min and the isoflurane vaporizer to 1-2% . As soon as the mouse becomes unresponsive and has shallow breathing, it may be transferred to the anesthesia platform with the nose cone and placed on a heating pad. Position the mouse head so that the eye to be injured is facing up towards the microscope objective.3.  Squeeze the bottle of Proparacaine and place 1 drop of Proparacaine on the cornea. Wait 30 sec.4.  Use a weck-cel to dry off the cornea by gently sweeping across cornea once and dabbing both corners of the eye.5.  Apply periocular pressure with one hand to proptose the mouse eye. (Optional step: Take a brightfield picture of the cornea prior to injury.)6.  Use the other hand to mark the cornea with the trephine as central as possible with gentle pressure. Hold the handle of trephine with your thumb and second fingers and place the entire circular edge on the cornea. Gently turn the trephine with mild pressure approximately 3 clock hours to mark the cornea. Avoid making multiple marks.7.  Turn the Algerbrush on and make an epithelial defect in the center of the cornea by applying gentle pressure in a circular manner and observing a break in the surface epithelial cell layer. Carefully extend the epithelial defect close to the trephine mark.8.  Turn the Algerbrush off and use the dull blades of the Algerbrush burr to gently remove the remaining corneal epithelium out to the trephine mark. Apply Fluorescein solution to the cornea and confirm size of epithelial defect using the microscope GFP filter.9.  Optional step: Apply periocular pressure to proptose the mouse eye. Take a fluorescence picture of the wounded cornea after applying Fluorescein solution and using the GFP filter (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Corneal scratch/epithelial injury.

A typical approach for anesthesia involves placing the animal in an induction chamber connected to an oxygen source and isoflurane vaporizer, and adjusting oxygen flow to 0.9~L/m i n and the isoflurane vaporizer to 1-2% . As soon as the mouse becomes unresponsive and has shallow breathing, it may be transferred to the anesthesia platform with the nose cone and placed on a heating pad. Position the mouse head so that the eye to be injured is facing up towards the microscope objective.3.  Place 1 drop of Proparacaine on the cornea. Wait 30 sec.4.  Use a weck-cel to dry off the cornea by gently sweeping across cornea once and dabbing both corners of the eye.5.  Use the forceps to submerge the filter paper into the NaOH solution for exactly 10 sec.6.  Apply periocular pressure with one hand to proptose the mouse eye. (Optional step: Take a brightfield picture of the cornea prior to injury.)7.  Use forceps in the other hand to apply the NaOH-soaked filter paper to the center cornea for exactly 30 sec. Perform this step using the stereomicroscope to precisely place the filter paper as central as possible.8.  Remove the filter disc from the cornea using forceps.9.  Immediately flush the eye with 500~ul PBS to wash away residual NaOH (apply PBS, dry with weck-cel, apply PBS, dry with weck-cel, repeat until all 500~ul PBS has been used).10.

Tissue culture plastic plates and flasks were from BD biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany). Fluorescent conjugated anti-human antibodies were from BD biosciences. Anti-Oct4 antibody was from Santa Cruz. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), recombinant human BDNF, chondrogenic differentiation media, neurobasal media, neuronal supplements and Tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) were purchased from Thermofisher scientific (Paisley, UK).Extra Ocular Muscle Tissue CollectionEOM samples were obtained from patients undergoing corrective surgery for strabismus in collaboration with the Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus at Sri Sankaradeva Nethralaya Hospital after written informed consent and in accordance with the hospital human ethics committee guidelines. The tissues were collected in vials containing DMEM with antibiotics and processed within 12 hours. The tissue was rinsed briefly in PBS containing 2x antibiotics, mechanically dissociated with forceps and plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Fresh media was added regularly until colonies with spindle shaped cells were obtained.Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem CellsBone marrow samples were obtained from patients referred to Hematology department of Gauhati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) after written informed consent following GMCH human ethical committee guidelines. Bone marrow cells after red cell lysis were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at a cell density of 1x105 cells/cm2. Complete media change was performed after 48 hours to remove the non-adherent cells and spindle shaped adherent colonies appeared after 2–3 weeks in culture.Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) AnalysisCells were grown on fibronectin coated coverslips, fixed with ice-cold acetone:methanol (1:1) solution and dehydrated with graded series of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90% and 100%). The cells were gold coated with a sputter coater and viewed under Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Zeiss, Germany).Immunocytochemical StainingCells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. The cells were permeabilised with 0.1% triton X-100 for 20 minutes, washed and stained with primary antibody in 2% FBS solution at 4°C overnight and with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody for 1-2hr at room temperature. Nucleus was stained with 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI, 5mg/ml) and cells were washed, mounted and documented microscopically (Zeiss, Axio Observer Z1).Phenotyping by Flow CytometryAdherent cells were trypsinized and stained with fluorescent dye conjugated monoclonal antibodies against human cell surface antigens (BD Biosciences). The cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes, washed and analyzed with FACS calibur (Becton Dickinson). Propidium iodide was added before analysis for live/dead separation.For intracellular markers, the cells were trypsinized and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and permeabilised with TritonX-100 (0.1%) and stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies for 1hr at room temperature.SSEA4 StainingThe cells were cultured on fibronectin coated cover slips for 24–48 hours. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-SSEA4 (Chemicon) antibody for 1 hour. The cells were washed and stained with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody. The stained cells were microscopically documented.Colony Forming Unit AssayOne hundred cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured in media containing 20% FBS for 14 days. The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and stained with May-Grünwald and Giemsa solution. Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted.Adipogenic, Osteogenic and Chondrogenic DifferentiationEOM-MSC and BM-MSC were differentiated into adipocytes and osteocytes using specific induction media as reported earlier [14]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% serum supplemented with dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, indomethacin and insulin for adipogenic differentiation and dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate, and ascorbic acid for osteogenic differentiation. After 21–28 days, differentiation was analyzed by staining for alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red to detect osteogenic differentiation and oil red-O for analysis of adipogenic differentiation. Expression of OSTEOCALCIN and ADIPOQ in osteo- and adipo-differentiated cells respectively were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR.For chondrogenic differentiation, micromass cultures were generated in a 12-well plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermofisher scientific). Media change was performed every three days and the differentiated cells were stained with Safranin O after 21 days. Expression of SOX9 was analysed in chondrogenic differentiated cells by real-time PCR.Neuronal DifferentiationThe cells were plated in poly-l-lysine coated plates at a density of 1.5-2x105 cells/cm2. For neuronal differentiation, culture medium was replaced with pre-induction medium composed of DMEM, FBS (20%), FGF2 (10 ng/ml), B27 (2%), Forskolin (50 μM), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 250 μM) with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, 100μM) and incubated for 24 h. To initiate neuronal differentiation, the pre-induction medium was removed, washed with PBS, and replaced with neuronal induction medium containing DMEM, FBS (2%), FGF2 (10 ng/ml), insulin—transferrin—selenium supplements (1%), B27 (2%), Forskolin (5 μM), IBMX (125 μM), BDNF (50 ng/ml) with 2-ME (100 μM), and all-trans retinoic acid (RA, 0.5 μM). The cells were incubated for an additional 14–21 days.Real Time Quantitative PCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated from EOM-MSC and BM-MSC using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and Oligo dT primers (Sigma) at 37°C for 120 minutes. The conditions for the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C at 15 seconds, primer annealing and extension at 60°C for 45 seconds and a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes using Power SyBr Green real-time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) using 7500 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).

The gene expression levels in each sample were normalized to their respective GAPDH expression levels. The expression levels were quantified using ΔΔCt method.Clonal Cell Line DerivationClonal cell lines were derived from EOM-MSC through limited dilution by plating one cell per well in a 96 well plate. Presence of one cell/well was confirmed microscopically after few hours and proliferating clones were expanded further.Mitochondrial StainingMitochondria in EOM-MSC were visualized by staining with Tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester(TMRE) as described earlier [15]. Briefly, TMRE (100nM) was added to the cells in the culture media and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Stained cells were visualized using Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany).Karyotype AnalysisFor karyotype analysis, colchicine (0.1μg/ml) was added to the cells in culture for 16 hours. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 0.56% KCl solution for 30 minutes at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with glacial acetic acid and methanol mixture (1:3) and dropped into clean wet slides. The slides were dried, chromosomes were stained with Giemsa and documented.Data AnalysisFlow cytometry data was analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc).

Synchronize worms with bleaching protocols: use C. elegans plates with many gravid hermaphrodites (Stiernagle, 2006). Wash the plates with sterile H_2O . 2.  Collect the liquid in a sterile 15ml Falcon tube. Add H_2O to a total volume of 3.5ml .3.  Mix 0.5 ml 5 N NaOH with 1 ml bleach. Make this solution fresh just before use Add to the centrifuge tube with the worms.4.  Vortex the tube for a few seconds. Repeat vortexing every 2 min for a total of 10min .5.  Spin the tube in a centrifuge for 30 sec at 1,300xg to pellet the released eggs.6.  Aspirate to 0.1 ml .7.  Add sterile H_2O to 5ml . Vortex for a few seconds.8.  Repeat steps A6 and A7.9.  Transfer the eggs in the remaining 0.1ml of liquid to the edge of a clean NGM plate seeded with an E. coli OP50 lawn and incubate at ^20^°C . Note: If you use C. elegans mutants that do not change their intrinsic nature under high temperature, you can incubate eggs at 25~^°C as some mutants grow slower than WT.10. Inoculate Bcc strains in 15~ml Falcon tubes containing 3 ml of LB and incubate the tubes at 37^°C for 24h in shaking condition (220 rpm). Note: As controls, use E. coli OP50 in the place of Bcc strains.# B.  Day 21.  Normalize Bcc cultures at 1.7O D/ml and seed 50~ul of the culture on 3.5 cm diameter plates containing 3ml of NGM agar (slow killing assay, SKA) or PGS agar (fast killing assay, FKA). Incubate the plates O/N at 37^°C . Note: Incubation of Bcc strains at 37~^°C should never exceed 16 h. Do not store Bcc seeded plates at 4^°C_: , as many of these pathogens are very sensitive to temperature and this can cause variation.2.  Check the developmental stage of worms. After 24h worms should be at larval stage L2 or L3 when grown at ^20^°C .# C.  Day 31.  Wash synchronized worms at larval stage 4 (L4) off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15 ml Corning tubes.2.  Wash worms 2-3 times with M9 buffer to remove residual bacterial cells.3.  Spot 30-40 L4 worms on the plates seeded with Bcc strains (5 replicas). Note: Before adding the worms, plates should be kept at room temperature to cool them down after the incubation at 37^°C .4.  Count worms at time 0. Incubate the plates at ^20^°C and perform daily count of surviving worms up to day 5 (for FKA) and day 6 (for SKA). Note: A worm is considered dead when it no longer responds to gentle touch with a platinum wire.5.  At the end of the experiment, calculate the average percentage of surviving worms.6.  Evaluate Bcc pathogenicity. The virulence ranking (VR) ranges from 0 to 3 and it is based on the percentage of surviving worms after the period of observation. A Bcc strain is considered to be non-pathogenic (VR=0) ) when the percentage of worms alive at the conclusion of the period of observation ranges from 100% to 80% ; VR=1 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 79% to 50% ; VR=2 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 49% to 6% ; finally, the VR is considered 3 when the percentage of surviving worms was eq5% (Figure 1).()Figure 1.

CEN.PK 530.1CK [MATα URA3 HIS3 LAU2 TRP1 SUC2 MAL2-8c tpi1(41-707)] is further referred to as AACK. Previous studies have engineered AACK to improve protein production, leading to two strains, B184 and K17 (5, 34). B184 is generated by UV mutagenesis, and K17 has the genotype AACK (Δhda2 Δvps5 Δtda3 PGK1p-COG5 Δgos1::amdSYM-TEF1p-PDI1). AACK, B184, and K17 additionally have a disrupted TPI1 gene. To complement this deficiency, we use the pAlphaAmyCPOT plasmid with an expression cassette for α-amylase. This cassette has an α-leader sequence and an α-amylase gene from Aspergillus oryzae (58). As a control, an empty CPOT plasmid was used. The GCN2 gene was disrupted with the help of plasmid pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX, which contains both a cas9 gene and a guide RNA (gRNA) expression cassette (59). The plasmids pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-GCN2 and pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-URA3 were made using pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-tHFD1 as the template (59). First, the backbone was obtained by linearizing pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-tHFD1 by digestion with MunI and EcoRI. The left fragment was constructed with primer 54 in combination with either 53 (GCN2) or 61 (URA3), and the right fragment was constructed with primer 55 in combination with either 52 (GCN2) or 60 (URA3). The correct assembly of the plasmids was confirmed by sequencing using primer 42. The genomic deletion was verified using primer pairs 38 and 39 for GCN2 and 40 and 41 for URA3. An overview of the plasmids used in this study can be found in Table 1. The sequences of the primers used to make the gRNA and repair fragments and their verification can be found in Table 2. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for plasmid amplification.TABLE 1List of plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionReference or sourcepAlphaAmyCPOT2μ vector with cassette expressing POT1 gene from S. pombe and an expression cassette with α-leader sequence and α-amylase gene under native TPI1 promoter and terminator58pCPOT2μ vector with cassette expressing POT1 gene from S. pombe58pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-tHFD12μ vector with kanMX marker expressing eCas9 under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator and the gRNA targeting HDF1 under the SNR52 promoter59pECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-tGCN22μ vector with kanMX marker expressing eCas9 under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator and the gRNA targeting GCN2 under the SNR52 promoterThis studypECAS9-gRNA-kanMX-tURA32μ vector with kanMX marker expressing eCas9 under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator and the gRNA targeting URA3 under the SNR52 promoterThis studypRS416TEF roGFP2-PRX12μ vector with URA3 marker with a expression cassette with roGFP2-PRX1 under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator29pRS416TEF roGFP2-PfAOP2μ vector with URA3 marker with a expression cassette with roGFP2-PfAOP under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator33pRS416TEF roGFP2-PfAOP409M2μ vector with URA3 marker with a expression cassette with roGFP2-PfAOP409M under the TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator33pVW312μ vector with URA3 marker with a firefly luciferase cDNA under control of a fragment of the GCN4 promoter and an independent cassette with renilla luciferase under control of native PGK1 promoter39TABLE 2List of primers used for strain construction in this studyPrimerDescriptionaTemplateSequence54Fw; EcoRI cut sitepECAS9-gRNA-kanMXGGAACAACACAAACACTAC55Rv; Munl cut sitepECAS9-gRNA-kanMXCAAAGGAAATGATAGCATTGAA52Fw; GCN2 gRNApECAS9-gRNA-kanMXATAAATGATCAATGTTATAGAAGATTCAACGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG53Rv; GCN2 gRNApECAS9-gRNA-kanMXGCTCTAAAACGTTGAATCTTCTATAACATTGATCATTTATCTTTCACTGCG60Fw; URA3 gRNApECAS9-gRNA-kanMXATAAATGATCGGGTCAACAGTATAGAACCGGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG61Rv; URA3 gRNApECAS9-gRNA-kanMXGCTCTAAAACCGGTTCTATACTGTTGACCCGATCATTTATCTTTCACTGCG38Fw; GCN2 genomic verificationChromosome IVGCCTCACACAACATACGCAC39Rv; GCN2 genomic verificationChromosome IVGGAGGAAGCAGTCACCCATC40Fw; URA3 genomic verificationChromosome VACGAAGGAAGGAGCACAGAC41Rv; URA3 genomic verificationChromosome VCCAGTACACCTTATCGGCCC42Fw; upstream gRNA on the Cas9 plasmidpECAS9-gRNA-kanMXGGACGCTCGAAGGCTTTAATaFw, forward; Rv, reverse.Media and culture conditions.Media used for S. cerevisiae strain construction were YPD, YPE, YPEG, and SD-URA. The experiments were always performed at 30°C and 220 rpm. YPD medium contained 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, and 20 g/liter glucose and was used for all cultures unless otherwise mentioned. For the selection of the kanMX marker on the CRISPR plasmid, 200 mg/liter G418 (Formedium, Hunstanton, UK) was added to the YPD medium. The YPE medium contained 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, 20 g/liter absolute ethanol and was used solely as a solid medium. For liquid cultivations, 30 g/liter glycerol was added to YPE, and the medium was referred to as YPEG. Both YPE and YPEG were used only for S. cerevisiae strains without CPOT plasmids, since those are unable to ferment glucose as the sole carbon source (60). SD-URA contained 20 g/liter glucose, 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and 0.77 g/liter complete supplement mixture without uracil (CSM-URA; Formedium) This medium was only used to verify the deletion of the URA3 gene. To solidify media, 20 g/liter agar (Merck Millipore) was added. The protein expression and physiological experiments were performed in SD2XSCAA medium with glutamine instead of glutamate. SD-2XSCAA medium contained 20 g/liter glucose, 6.9 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 190 mg/liter Arg, 400 mg/liter Asp, 1260 mg/liter Gln, 130 mg/liter Gly, 140 mg/liter His, 290 mg/liter Ile, 400 mg/liter Leu, 440 mg/liter Lys, 108 mg/liter Met, 200 mg/liter Phe, 220 mg/liter Thr, 40 mg/liter Trp, 52 mg/liter Tyr, 380 mg/liter Val, 1 g/liter BSA, 5.4 g/liter Na2HPO4, and 8.56 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O and had a pH of 6.4.Characterization of the roGFP2 sensors was performed in Delft synthetic medium (61), and the verification of the luciferase expression was done in defined synthetic medium lacking uracil, using 14-ml cultivation tubes (62). Protein production experiments and GCN4 expression experiments were performed at 30°C at 220 rpm in aerated 24-well plates (CR1224; Bioscreen) with a volume of 2.5 ml and a starting optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01. All other samples were grown in 100-ml shake flasks with 10 ml SD2XSCAA medium and a starting OD600 of 0.01. The cultures for qPCR analysis were grown in a volume of 20 ml with a starting OD600 of 0.01. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C and 200 rpm. Selection medium contained 80 mg/liter ampicillin. The transformation procedure used for E. coli was according to a known protocol (63).Molecular biology techniques.S. cerevisiae strains were transformed according to the protocol using the Li/Ac SS carrier method (64). Five hundred nanograms of DNA was used for the transformation of plasmids and an additional 1 μg repair fragment when required. To verify deletions or test for the presence of the CPOT plasmids, colony PCR was performed using SapphireAmp fast PCR mix (TaKaRa Bio). For DNA construction, Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) was used. Restriction digestion was performed using FastDigest (Thermo Scientific) products. All techniques were used according to the manufacturer’s protocols unless otherwise stated.α-Amylase assay.Cells were harvested after 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C, 8,000 rpm for 5 min, and then the supernatant was used for the α-amylase quantification assay. The Ceralpha kit (Megazyme) was used with α-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae as the standard. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the exception of the preparation of buffer A. Since the protein was dissolved in the medium, instead of preparing buffer A and dissolving solidified protein, we used a mixture of medium and Milli Q water, depending on the concentration of α-amylase, to make buffer A with the correct concentration and protein. We used a dilution of 200× or 400× depending on the concentration of α-amylase in the medium.Growth profiler.The S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated for 48 h in 250 μl SD2XSCAA medium at 30°C and 1,200 rpm in 96-well plates (CR1496d; Enzyscreen). Growth curves were measured using a Growth Profiler 960 (Enzyscreen). Three independent colonies per strain were grown in 1 ml SD2XSCAA medium in 7-ml cultivation tubes after an overnight culture. The cells were then inoculated in technical triplicates with a starting OD600 of 0.005.Microbioreactor cultures.S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated for 96 h in 1 ml SD2XSCAA medium at 30°C and 1,200 rpm in flower plates. The characterization of the sensors was performed in Delft minimal medium and the experiments in SD2XSCAA medium. Three independent colonies per strain were grown in 1 ml SD2XSCAA medium in 7-ml cultivation tubes after an overnight culture. Cells were then inoculated in technical duplicates with a starting OD600 of 0.005. For measuring the biomass, excitation and emission at 600 nm was used with a gain of 20; for the oxidation of cysteine, excitation at 405 nm and emission at 520 nm with a gain of 100 were used; and for the reduction of cysteine, excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm with a gain of 100 were used. All wells were measured every 20 min by a Biolector microbioreactor system (M2p-Labs).Ox/Red ratio determination.Background fluorescence was determined using strains carrying an empty p416 vector. We used biological duplicates of these controls with technical duplicates. The natural fluorescence per strain was determined at both 405 nm (Ox) and 488 nm (Red). For both wavelengths, the average natural fluorescence was determined. These average values were subtracted from the Ox and Red measurements of all the separate replicates with the roGFP2 sensors. The GFP signals with the natural fluorescence subtracted were used to determine the Ox/Red ratio per replicate per strain. The final Ox/Red ratio was determined by taking the average of the ratios per strain. R Studio software was used for all data analyses (65).qPCR.Cells were harvested after 24 h and 48 h, and cells were then instantly cooled on ice and centrifuged at 4°C, 6,000 rpm, for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. For RNA extraction, the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For cDNA synthesis, the Quantitect reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen) was used. For the qPCR, the DyNaMo ColorFlash SYBR green qPCR kit was used. All primers used for qPCR are listed in Table 3 and were verified using the MIQE guidelines, with ACT1 used as the reference gene.TABLE 3List of primers used for qPCR in this studyDirectionGeneSequenceFwHAC1 splicedGCGTCGGACCAAGAGACTTCRvHAC1 splicedCTGACTGCGCTTCTGGATTACFwHAC1 unsplicedCAATTGGCGTAATCCAGCCGRvHAC1 unsplicedAGCTGGGGCTAGTGTTCTTGFwERO1CGCTTGCTCTGTTGATGTCGRvERO1TCGTCATCGCTATCATCCGCFwPDI1CCCAGGTGGTAAGAAGTCCGRvPDI1CAATTCAGCGTCAGCATCGGFwCTT1GCTTCTCAATACTCAAGACCAGRvCTT1GCGGCGTATGTAATATCACTCFwfRMsrGTCATTGATCTGGCATGCGTRvfRMsrCCGCAAACACCTTTACCGAAFwTSA1ACACCAACCACTCTTTGTCCAGRvTSA1GGCTTCAACCAATCTCAAGGCTTCFwTRX2GAACAATATTCTGACGCTGCTRvTRX2CCGACGACTCTGGTAACCTFwSRX1CCAACAGAAATTCCTCTCTCARvSRX1AGCCGCCTCAGCCTGTTCFwEUG1ATGGTCAAGTCTATCGCGGTRvEUG1TTCAAGCCTGTCAAGCCTCTFwKAR2TCAATGACGCGCAAAGACAARvKAr2TCGAAAGTACCACCACCCAAFwSCJ1TTGTCAAGGTCGTGGGGTTARvSCJ1ATGTAGTTTCTTGGTGCGCCFwLHS1GGACACTACTCAGCCCGTTARvLHS1TTTGCCTTCTCTGCTGCTTGFwJEM1ACGTTCAACTGTCGAGACCTRvJEM1CTCTTGACGTCCGGACTCATFwFKB2GGCTCTCCTATCGCTTTTGARvFKB2CAGCACTTGGAGGAATGACGPuromycin treatment.Yeast cells were grown in SD2XSCAA and grown until the mid-exponential phase (OD600 of ∼1). Cells were then normalized to an OD600 of 1 and then harvested and collected by centrifugation before being incubated in 100 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mM puromycin for 10 min at 30°C, 220 rpm. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, and intracellular proteins were extracted as described previously (66). Ten microliters of the cell extracts was then used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.eIF2α protein extraction.For the intracellular protein extraction of the elongation factor eIF2α, protein extraction with LiAc/NaOH was performed as in reference 67. Yeast cells were harvested after 24 h and 48 h (OD600 of 5) and at 72 h and 96 h (OD600 of 10), and 10 μl of the cell extracts was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Western blotting.Samples and controls were loaded and separated with stain-free 4 to 20% gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-blot turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). The blot was blocked using Western blocker solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated in either anti-total eIF2α (1:1,000), anti-puromycin (1:1,000), or eIF2α-phosphorylated (1:1,000; Ser-51; Invitrogen), followed by incubation with either anti-mouse (1:5,000) or anti-rabbit (1:5,000). Both secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated, visualized using West Pico plus HRP substrate (Thermo Fischer), and measured with a ChemidoC XRS image analyzer (Bio-Rad).Viability measurements.Cell viability was measured using propidium iodide (Invitrogen) staining as described previously (66). Samples were taken after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 13 days of cultivation in 10 ml of SD2XSCAA medium from 100-ml shakeflasks. Fluorescence was measured with a Guava easyCyte 8HT system (Merck Millipore). For each sample, 5,000 cells were counted. The cultivations were performed in biological triplicate, and unstained cells were used as a negative control for the fluorescence measurements.GCN4 expression assay.The luciferase construct was tested in an S. cerevisiae BY4742 strain in which the pVW31 plasmid was transformed. Three biological replicas were cultivated in 7 ml cultivation tubes to which 10 mM (final concentration) 3-AT was added and incubated for 30 min. Luminescence was checked before and after the addition of 3-AT (3-aminotriazole). For the GCN4 expression experiment, cells were harvested after 24 h and 48 h, and 2 ml of culture was centrifuged for 5 min at 35,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was then discarded, and cells were washed in 1 ml cold water. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl PBS buffer with protease inhibitors and added to lysin matrix tubes (MP Bio). The mixture was Fast prepped at 5,000 rpm for 20 s 3 times, with incubation of the samples on ice between runs. The mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed at 4°C, and 100 μl of clear supernatant was harvested and stored at −20°C. Luminescence was measured with a FluoStar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) and treated with the protocol and reagents of the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All reagents were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC8276805.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Genomic Signature of Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Breast and Ovarian Cancers","text":"Genomic Signature of Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Breast and Ovarian Cancers\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  Preprocessing of SNP array data1.  Normalize .CEL files by the appropriate software depending on the array platform.2.  Export  the  normalized  data:  chromosome,  position,  Log_R_Ratio  (Illumina)  or Log_2_Ratio (Affymetrix), B allele frequency (BAF, Illumina) or Allelic Difference (AD, Affymetrix) into a text file.3.  Process SNP-arrays by (for example) GAP method (Popova et al., 2009) to obtain (Birkbak et al., 2011) estimation of normal contamination and (Carter et al., 2012) absolute copy number and allelic content profiles (Table 1).Table 1. Segmented tumor genomic profile (a fragment from Affymetrix OncoScan 300K)()* 1 stands for p arm and 1.5 stands for q arm of chromosome 1; pericentric region is indicated in red.# B.  Quality control1.  Quality control of measured SNP-array profile: software for primary data normalization usually provides quality index for each chip; chips indicated to have marginal quality have to be excluded from further analysis; indication of quality cut-offs could be found in corresponding User Guides.2.  Contamination of tumor sample by normal stromal cells: sample with more than 65% of predicted normal cells admixture have to be excluded from further analysis (Note: Measured tumor sample usually represents a mixture of tumor and normal cells in different proportions, which results in different contrast in the measured SNP-array profile; 60-70% of normal contamination is at the limit of current recognition techniques).3.  Quality control of copy number and allelic content recognition: Pattern of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a tumor genome have to be “interpretable”, meaning, copy number variation and allelic imbalance profiles have to be consistent. Unfortunately, there is no reliable measure of such consistency developed; we used manual control of recognition based on the GAP plots (Figure 1). GAP plot of a tumor genome is a two dimensional representation of segmented SNP array profiles, where each circle represents a segment (Popova et al., 2009). Clear and regular structure of the GAP plot indicates consistency (Figure 1A), while chaotic structure indicates inconsistency (Figure 1B). Samples with inconsistent profiles have to be excluded from further analysis.()Figure 1. GAP plots for two tumor samples measured by Affymetrix OncoScan 300K representing (A) high quality and (B) low quality profiles. GAP plot of a tumor genome is a two dimensional representation of segmented SNP array profiles, where each circle represents a segment (Popova et al., 2009). Tumor samples are from GEO database (GSE28330, Birkbak et al., 2012).4.  Quality control of adequate detection of chromosomal breaks: Highly contaminated tumor samples together with unspecific variation in SNP array profiles often result in false positive chromosomal breaks detected by segmentation algorithms; the sample need to be discarded in the case of large number of false positive breaks. Adequate formal procedure for this type of quality control is not yet developed. We performed rough visual estimation of consistency of detected breaks in copy number variation and in recognized copy number profiles.Note: Poor quality sample comprises around 10-15% of hybridized samples, including low tumor content, poor hybridization, low recognition quality, etc.C.  Calculating the number of large-scale chromosomal breaks from segmented profile (Table 1, Figure 2):Note: Here we describe how to estimate the number of chromosomal breaks related to homologous recombination deficiency; filtering of variation is performed only for the purpose of estimation of breakpoints number and has no relation to particular alterations whatever important they are.1.  Filtering out micro-variation: The size of micro-variation S_micro is the lower limit of the detectable somatic alteration size, which is dependent on the SNP density in the array; for example, we used 50 SNPs for Affymetrix SNP 6.0; 30 SNPs for Illumina 600K; etc. Note: Main reason for this filtering is that micro-variations are often linked to germline copy number variations. a.  Exclude from the segmented genomic profile all segments less than S_micro SNPs and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.2.  Filtering out and smoothing small-scale variation: The size of small-scale variation, S_small <3 Mb, was defined in (Popova et al., 2012).Note: Main reason for this definition is that starting from 3 Mb chromosomal breaks follow a Poisson distribution, i.e. are independent from each other; while the small-scale segments tend to cluster in discrete chromosomal regions.a.  Order small-scale segments according to the size.b.  Exclude from the segmented genomic profile the smallest segment and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.c.  Repeat filtering and smoothing until the last small segment. Note: The way of filtering and smoothing small-scale variations has a minor effect on the resulting profile.3.  Calculating number of Large-scale State Transitions (LSTs) of the size S Mb: LST_SMb is defined as a chromosomal break (change in copy number or allelic content) between two adjacent (<3 Mb in between) segments >=S Mb each; number of LSTs is calculated directly from the segmented genomic profile after filtering and smoothing of small-scale variation (Figure 2).a.  Annotate  chromosomal  breaks  as  follows:  If  two  segments  from  the  same chromosome arm differ in Copy Number or in Major Allele, and are >=S M b in size, and the distance between the segments is <3 Mb, the break is annotated as LST_SMb;b.  Calculate number of LST_SMb ( Xi=3 , 4,…, 11 Mb) in a tumor genome. Note: Centromeric breaks are not taken into account.()Figure 2.

LRR: log R ratio profile; BAF: B allele frequency profile; GT: segmental genotypes recognized by GAP; LST_10 Mb: black arrows point to LST_10 Mb detected. The black under-line shows large-scale segments obtained after filtering and smoothing small-scale variations seen in the GT profile. Chromosome 3 of a tumor sample from GEO database is shown (GSE28330, Birkbak et al., 2012).# D. Estimation of tumor ploidy:1.  Estimate DNA index for a tumor genome as an average copy number in a genome divided by 2.2.  Estimate chromosome counts in a tumor genome as a sum of copy numbers at pericentric regions of each chromosome arm (Table 1), following the rules: a.  If the size of a segment in pericentric region is >=1.5 Mb (or 500 SNPs for Affymetrix SNP6.0), the number of copies of corresponding chromosome arm is set to that of the segment; b.  If the size of a segment in pericentric region is <1.5 Mb, chromosome arm count is replaced by its average copy number. Note: Chromosome number is estimated after filtering micro-variation.3.  Estimate tumor ploidy following the rule: tumor ploidy is estimated to be 2 (near-diploid genome) if DNA index <1.3 and chromosome counts <60 ; tumor ploidy is estimated to be 4 (near-tetraploid genome) if DNA index >=1.3 and chromosome counts >=60 . Note: This attribution is obtained for breast and ovarian cancer genomes based on the analysis of a large number of tumor genomes, (Popova et al., 2012). Genomes with ambiguous attribution of ploidy represented less than 5% of all cases considered. Other cancers might have different genomic evolution and the thresholds for ploidy attribution might need to be adjusted.# E. Signature of homologous recombination deficiency in a tumor genomeBased on the analysis of a large series of breast cancers with known status of BRCA1/2 genes the number of LST_6,7,8,9,10 Mb were found to represent effective discriminating features with naturally defined ploidy-specific cutoffs, which allowed prediction of BRCA1/2 inactivation with high accuracy and precision (Table 2). Testing the signature on ovarian cancer showed LST_6,7 Mb to be the most efficient prediction features with similar to breast cancer cohort cut-offs.1.  Tumor genome is annotated as homologous recombination deficient if number of LSTs in a tumor genome is higher than corresponding ploidy-specific cut-off (Table 2). Note: Tumors with borderline LST number could be false positives due to false positive breaks detected in the genome. Inconsistency among LST_6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Mb predictions are rare.Table 2. Cut-offs for LST number predicting BRCAness in breast cancer()*Cut-offs  correspond  to  max (TPR-FPR);  cut-offs  in  parenthesis  correspond  to  100 sensitivity.P: Numbers of BRCA1/2 mutated tumors; N: Number of BRCA1/2 wild type or not tested tumors;TPR: True positive rate; FPR: False positive rate.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preprocessing of SNP Array Data\nNormalize.CEL files by the appropriate software depending on the array platform.\nExport the normalized data: chromosome, position, Log_R_Ratio (Illumina) or Log_2_Ratio (Affymetrix), B allele frequency (BAF, Illumina) or Allelic Difference (AD, Affymetrix) into a text file.\n## Process SNP-Arrays\nProcess SNP-arrays by (for example) GAP method to obtain estimation of normal contamination and absolute copy number and allelic content profiles.\nRefer to Table 1 for an example of a segmented tumor genomic profile.\n## Quality Control\nPerform quality control of measured SNP-array profile: check the quality index for each chip and exclude chips with marginal quality.\n## Contamination of Tumor Sample by Normal Stromal Cells\nCheck for contamination of tumor sample by normal stromal cells: exclude samples with more than 65% of predicted normal cells admixture.\nNote that measured tumor sample usually represents a mixture of tumor and normal cells in different proportions.\n## Quality Control of Copy Number and Allelic Content Recognition\nCheck the pattern of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a tumor genome: it should be interpretable.\nUse manual control of recognition based on the GAP plots to ensure consistency.\nRefer to Figure 1 for examples of GAP plots.\n## Quality Control of Adequate Detection of Chromosomal Breaks\nPerform rough visual estimation of consistency of detected breaks in copy number variation and in recognized copy number profiles.\nDiscard samples with a large number of false positive breaks.\n## Calculating the Number of Large-Scale Chromosomal Breaks\n## Filtering Out Micro-Variation\nDetermine the size of micro-variation (S_micro) based on the SNP density in the array.\nExclude from the segmented genomic profile all segments less than S_micro SNPs and link adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.\n## Filtering Out and Smoothing Small-Scale Variation\nDefine the size of small-scale variation (S_small) as <3 Mb.\nOrder small-scale segments according to the size and exclude the smallest segment, linking adjacent segments if they have identical Copy Numbers and Major Alleles.\nRepeat filtering and smoothing until the last small segment.\n## Calculating Number of Large-Scale State Transitions (LSTs)\nAnnotate chromosomal breaks as LST_SMb if two segments from the same chromosome arm differ in Copy Number or in Major Allele, and are >=S Mb in size, and the distance between the segments is <3 Mb.\nCalculate the number of LST_SMb (Xi=3, 4, …, 11 Mb) in a tumor genome.\nRefer to Figure 2 for an example of a genomic profile with detected copy numbers and LSTs.\n## Estimation of Tumor Ploidy\nEstimate DNA index for a tumor genome as an average copy number in a genome divided by 2.\n## Estimate Chromosome Counts\nEstimate chromosome counts in a tumor genome as a sum of copy numbers at pericentric regions of each chromosome arm.\nFollow the rules for estimating chromosome arm count based on segment size in pericentric region.\n## Estimate Tumor Ploidy\nEstimate tumor ploidy based on DNA index and chromosome counts.\nUse the rule: tumor ploidy is estimated to be 2 (near-diploid genome) if DNA index <1.3 and chromosome counts <60; tumor ploidy is estimated to be 4 (near-tetraploid genome) if DNA index >=1.3 and chromosome counts >=60.\n## Signature of Homologous Recombination Deficiency\nAnnotate tumor genome as homologous recombination deficient if the number of LSTs is higher than the corresponding ploidy-specific cut-off.\nRefer to Table 2 for cut-offs for LST number predicting BRCAness in breast cancer.\nNote that tumors with borderline LST number could be false positives due to false positive breaks detected in the genome.","keywords":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.814"}}

For all the following experiments, unless otherwise stated, rice plants were grown at 28 °C with 16 hr/8 hr light/dark cycles.4.2Nematode infection testMg infection on OsGSL2‐ and OsGNS5‐overexpressing rice lines was compared to nontransformed controls as follows. First, Mg eggs were isolated from 3‐month‐old infected roots by hand, followed by hatching at 28 °C for 2 days to collect the second‐stage juveniles (J2s). Rice seedlings were grown in polyvinylchloride tubes that were filled with sand absorbent polymer (Reversat et al., 1999); when 14 days old they were then inoculated with 300 J2s per plant. Infected root samples were collected at 7 dpi. Juveniles inside roots were observed by staining as described (Bybd et al., 1983), and the numbers of juveniles inside roots and galls per plant were recorded. Ten seedlings were analysed for each treatment, and all the experiments were repeated three times.4.3Development of transgenic rice linesFor construction of promoter‐GUS lines, promoter fragments of OsSUT1 to ‐5 were chosen as reported (Chung et al., 2014; Eom et al., 2011; Li et al., 2020; Scofield et al., 2007), and they were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of rice cv. Nipponbare using KOD‐Plus (TOYOBO). Sequence‐specific primers were used as described in Table S1, and a BamHI restriction site was added in each primer. The promoter fragments of OsSUT1 to ‐5 amplified were 2,306, 2,194, 2,257, 2,415, and 2,239 bp, respectively. The promoter fragments of OsSUT1 to ‐5 were then cloned in the BamHI restriction site in front of the β‐glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene of the binary vector DX2181 (Du et al., 2011). This vector carries a hygromycin resistance gene for selection of transformed rice calli. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To overexpress OsGSL2 (GenBank accession no. AP003223) and OsGNS5 (GenBank accession no. U72251) in rice, the coding regions of OsGSL2 and OsGNS5 (1,449 and 1,032 bp, respectively) were amplified from rice cv. Nipponbare cDNA using gene‐specific primers to which a KpnI restriction site was added (Table S1). The products were gel purified, cloned in the KpnI restriction site downstream of the ubiquitin promoter in the binary vector pU1301 (Hu et al., 2020), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The hygromycin resistance gene carried by pU1301 was used for the selection of transformed rice calli. The binary vectors constructed above were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens AH105 using electroporation, which was then used for transformation of rice cv. Nipponbare (Toki et al., 2006). Regenerated transgenic rice plants were grown in the greenhouse. GUS‐positive transgenic plants of pOsSUT1 to ‐5::GUS were identified by GUS staining of leaves and propagated to obtain their homozygous progeny. All the rice lines used for GUS staining in this study were confirmed to be transgenic for GUS by PCR amplification with GUS‐specific primers on their genomic DNA (Table S1). RT‐qPCR was used to analyse the GUS RNA level in the roots (see below). Rice plants overexpressing OsGSL2 or OsGNS5 were selected by germinating seeds on agarose plates containing hygromycin (50 mg/L; Roche) and propagated to obtain their homozygous progeny, of which the relative transcript abundance of OsGSL2 and OsGNS5 compared with nontransformed rice was characterized through RT‐qPCR as described below. The rice transgenic lines for use in this study were selected as follows: pOsSUT1 to ‐5::GUS homozygous rice lines with GUS RNA levels in roots comparable to that of corresponding OsSUTs in roots of wild‐type rice and OsGSL2‐ and OsGNS5‐overexpressing homozygous rice lines with high relative transcript abundance of the target gene in roots.4.4Histochemical GUS assayHistochemical GUS assay was performed according to Barthels et al. (1997). GUS staining was observed with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica). For testing the expression of OsSUT1 to ‐5 in GCs at different developmental stages, promoter‐GUS lines of pOsSUT1 to ‐5 were inoculated with Mg, and galls were sampled at 3, 7, and 14 dpi. The 35S promoter::GUS rice line was used as a positive control for the GUS assay. More than four plants from each group were tested.4.5Gene expression analyses by RT‐qPCRFor gene expression analysis of OsSWEET11 to ‐15 and OsSUT1 to ‐5 in rice root tissues during Mg parasitism on rice, seedlings were inoculated by Mg as described above. Control rice roots and galls caused by Mg were sampled at 3, 7, and 14 dpi. Noninoculated rice roots were taken as the calibration sample for each time point, and the gene expression levels of these samples were defined as 1. For transcript abundance assessments of OsGSL2 and OsGNS5 in their corresponding overexpressing rice lines, root tissues of 14‐day‐old rice seedlings were sampled. Roots from nontransformed rice plants were used as the calibration samples and the gene expression levels of these samples were defined as 1. In addition, for the analysis of GUS transcript levels in pOsSUT1 to ‐5::GUS rice lines, roots of 14‐day‐old rice seedlings were sampled. Roots of nontransformed rice were used as controls and transcript levels of the corresponding OsSUTs in those samples were defined as 1.Total RNA of each sample was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The mRNAs were then reverse‐transcribed using oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen) and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT‐qPCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500/7500 Fast Real‐Time PCR System (Life Technologies) with 20‐μl PCR mix containing 2 μl cDNA, 200 nM of the appropriate oligonucleotide primers, 10 μl of 2 × SYBR Premix Ex Taq, and 0.4 μl of 50 × ROX Reference Dye II (TaKaRa). The mix was preheated at 95 °C for 15 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Melting curve analysis was performed from incubation at 65 °C followed by 0.5 °C incremental ramp up to 95 °C. Melting curve lines were used to validate product specificity. Two rice genes, OseIF4α (GenBank accession no. AK073620) and OsUBQ5 (GenBank accession no. AK061988), were used as internal references (Nahar et al., 2011). The primers used for RT‐qPCR are listed in Table S1. Standard curve lines were established with four appropriate serial dilutions of first‐strand cDNAs. Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the 2−ΔΔ C t method (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001). At least six rice seedlings were pooled together for each sampling event. RT‐qPCR was carried out in triplicate for each sample, and there were three independent biological replicates for each treatment.4.6Quantification of callose deposition in Mg‐caused gallsCallose depositions inside Mg‐caused galls on the OsGNS5‐ and OsGSL2‐overexpressing rice lines and the control Nipponbare were quantified at 7 dpi. Galls from each group were sampled and callose inside them was stained according to Millet et al. (2010) with some modifications, where samples were treated under vacuum for each step and galls were photographed under an SZX16 stereomicroscope (Olympus). Callose quantification was performed using ImageJ software (https://imagej.en.softonic.com/). At least 25 galls from at least six plants were quantified for each group, and all the experiments were repeated three times.4.7Analysis of giant cell sizesMg‐caused galls of OsGSL2‐ and OsGNS5‐overexpression lines as well as control Nipponbare were collected at 7 dpi. GC measurement was then performed by using a TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica) as described (Cabrera et al., 2018), where z series of GCs at adult female stage were stacked and the largest size area of each giant cell was recorded using ImageJ software. At least 11 GCs from at least five plants were recorded for each line. There were three independent biological replicates.4.8Sucrose quantification by gas chromatography‐mass spectrometryFor characterizing the effect of altered callose deposition on sucrose content of root tissues and Mg‐caused galls, the transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGSL2 and OsGNS5 as well as their control lines were inoculated with Mg and compared to the corresponding noninoculated rice plants. Galls from inoculated rice plants and roots from the control were washed and collected at 7 dpi. Soluble sugars were extracted in 1.5 ml of 75% methanol. After incubation for 15 min at 70 °C, 1.2 ml of each sample was taken and transferred into a new tube. Then, 100 μl of 50 μg/ml ribitol (Sigma‐Aldrich) was added into each tube as internal standard and evaporated in vacuo to dryness. Finally, 50 μl of 15 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma‐Aldrich) was added to each tube. The tubes were incubated for 2 hr at 65 °C, followed by adding 50 μl of N‐methyl‐N‐trimethylsilyl‐trifluoroacetamide (Santacruze) to each tube, and then incubated for another 2 hr at the same condition. Samples prepared above were used for sucrose content analysis.An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975C mass spectrometer and a DB‐5MS column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness; J&W Scientific) was employed for analysis of sucrose in the samples. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The volume of injection was 1 μl and the split ratio was 10:1. The oven temperature was held at 70 °C for 4 min and then raised to 310 °C at 5 °C/min and held at that temperature for 10 min. All samples were analysed in both full‐scan (mass range of 40–510 amu) and selective ion scan modes. The injector inlet and transfer line temperature were 290 and 280 °C, respectively. Sucrose was identified from the retention times and mass spectra using the corresponding reference materials. Quantification of sucrose was performed according to the standard curves of reference materials. Each sample consisted of about 15 mg of fresh root tissues or galls, where root tissues were pooled from at least six plants and galls from at least 15 plants. There were three independent sampling events and three independent biological replicates.4.9Phloem loading with exogenous sucrose and CFDAPhloem loading with CFDA was carried out as described in Wright and Oparka (1997) with some modifications. CFDA was loaded on leaves of infected seedlings at 3 and 14 dpi with Mg, where the leaves were tweaked with tweezers and the applied absorbent cotton balls contained CFDA (0.65 mM; Sigma). Control plants were mock loaded with sterile distilled water. Seedlings were kept in darkness for 16 hr after CFDA was loaded. Finally, par‐J2s and adult females were isolated from galls at 3 and 15 dpi, respectively, and the green fluorescence of CFDA in the nematodes and galls were tested with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica) using UV light and an FITC filter. At least 15 galls from seven plants and nematodes isolated from the galls were observed for each experiment, and there were three independent biological replicates.4.10Statistical analysisAll data were expressed as mean ± SE. The experimental data were analysed using SPSS v. 30.0 (SPSS Inc.), applying a Student's t test for pairwise comparisons, or analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons of group means. Values with p < .05, p < .01, or p < .001 were considered statistically significant.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC8035636.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Detection of Transposable Element Insertion Site Polymorphisms by Sequence-Specific Amplification Polymorphism (SSAP)","text":"Detection of Transposable Element Insertion Site Polymorphisms by Sequence-Specific Amplification Polymorphism (SSAP)\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

Make a restriction reaction mixture that will be distributed equally into individual Eppendorf tubes. The reaction mixture combines (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 36~ul per reaction), the 1x enzyme buffer and the selected endonuclease (6 U per reaction), taking into account that 5ul of genomic DNA will be added into the mix. b.  Distribute 31~ul of the reaction mixture into each Eppendorf tube. c.  Add 5~ul of each DNA solution to be analysed (which correspond to 500 ng of genomic DNA) to the corresponding tube. d.  Mix gently the solution in each tube by pipeting, and centrifuge shortly. e.  Incubate at least 3h at 37^°C . f. Stop the enzyme activity by incubating the tubes 20 min at 65^°C . g.  Put the tubes on ice, centrifuge briefly and replace them on ice. Proceed immediately to the ligation step.2.  Prepare the adapters and ligate them to the restricted DNAsa.  In a 0.5ml Eppendorf tube, mix the two oligonucleotides ( 100~uM each) in equal proportions to make the adapter solution (final concentration of 50uM) ).b.  Incubate the mix at 95~^°C for 5 min (in a thermocycler) and let cool it down on the bench at room temperature.c.  Make a ligation reaction mixture, by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 50~ul per reaction), 1x ligase buffer, adapter solution (50 pmol) and T4 DNA ligase (1 U per reaction).d.  Distribute 14ul of the reaction mixture into the Eppendorf tubes containing each 36ul of restricted DNAs.e.  Mix gently using a pipette and then centrifuge shortly.f.     Incubate at 20-25^°C overnight (on the bench) to allow ligation.g.  Dilute the ligation products to 1/10 in 96-well PCR plates: 90~ul of sterile ultrapure water + 10 ul of the restriction-ligation products. Note: Store non-diluted restriction-ligation products at -20~^°C_i , but keep 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products at 4~^°C to avoid DNA degradation because of freezing - thawing cycles.Pre-amplificationa.  Use the first primer pair P1/P2 (Figure 1b) for the pre-amplification.b.  Make a pre-amplification PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20ul per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5 m M) ), dNTP solution (200~uM) , primer P1 anchored in the adapter (8 pmol), primer P2 anchored in the TE under study (8 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (3-4 U).c.  Distribute 17~ul of the pre-amplification reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.d.  Add 3ul of the 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.e.  Centrifuge.f.      PCR program i.    1 cycle at 72^°C for 2 min ii.    1 cycle at 94~^°C for 3 min iii.   25 cycles of ( 94~^°C for 30 sec, 56~^°C for 30 sec and 72^°C for 1 min) iv.   1 cycle at 72^°C for 5 min v.     Keep at 10^°Cg.  Verification of the pre-amplification products can be performed by agarose gel electrophoresis: Load 4~ul of the reaction product (with loading buffer) and run the electrophoresis for 20min at 100or .Note: A smear should be obtained (an example of the gel is shown in Figure 1b). h. Dilute the pre-amplification product in 96-well PCR plates according to the plate layout to carry out the separation of fragments using the LI-COR DNA analyzer. Note: The factor of dilution is usually 1/10 (36 µl of sterile ultrapure water ^ Ḋ +4 Ḍ µl of pre-amplification product) but it has to be adapted (1/2, 1/5, 1/10, or no dilution) according to the intensity of the smear observed after electrophoresis, in order to get homogeneous selective amplification products.4.  Selective amplificationa.  Use the second primer pair P3/P4 (Figure 1c) for the selective amplification to perform a nested PCR (to increase the specificity of the PCR reaction).b.  Make a selective PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20~ul per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5m M) ), dNTP solution (200~uM) , selective primer P3 anchored in the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides (4 pmol), selective primer P4 anchored in the TE under study and labelled with IRDye (4 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (1.5-2 U). Note: The primer labelled with the IRDye is sensitive to the light; the PCR plate has to be covered with aluminium foil to avoid degradation.c.  Distribute 15ul of the selective PCR reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.d.  Add 5~ul of the diluted pre-amplification products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.e.  Centrifuge.f.

Keep at 10^°C Note: Maintain the 96-well PCR plates out of the light by covering them with aluminium foil and once the program is finished keep them at -20~^°C. .B.  Electrophoresis run on LI-COR DNA analyzer to separate amplified products1.  Prepare the DNA analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.2.  Use 0.25 mm spacers between glass plates and prepare 40mI of 5.5% acrylamide gel.3.  Do pre-run with autofocus and following parameters: 45^°C ; 2,000 W; 25m A .()Figure 1. Schematic description of the different steps of the SSAP procedure to detect TE insertion site polymorphisms. (a). The genomic DNAs to be analysed are restricted using an endonuclease (here EcoRI, as used in Sarilar et al., 2013) and then ligated to corresponding adapters. (b). A pre-amplification is performed on the restrictionligation products using a specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P1) complementary to the adapter and the other primer (P2) anchored in the TE of interest. As illustrated by the picture, the pre-amplification should lead to a PCR product visualized as a smear after agarose gel electrophoresis. (c). The resulting PCR products are then subjected to a selective PCR amplification using another specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P3) complementary to the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides and the other primer (P4) anchored in the TE and labeled with an IRDye (at the varsigma^, end). (d). The resulting amplicons are finally resolved in a denaturing acrylamide gel; polymorphic bands can be visualized and scored as non-additive SSAP bands (being additional ^+ or missing -) when comparing the progeny profiling with the parental ones (as illustrated here for the analysis of resynthesized allotetraploid lines in comparison with their  diploid  progenitors,  Sarilar  et  al.,  2013).  Identification  of  the  nature  of  the polymorphism responsible for non-additivity (e.g. transposition, genomic rearrangement, polymorphism at the endonuclease cutting site) requires further cloning and sequencing of the corresponding SSAP amplicon.4.  Load the gela.  Mix the PCR products of selective amplification (2~ul) with equal amount of loading buffer.b.  Heat the samples at 95~^°C for 5 min for DNA denaturation and snap cool on ice before loading. Keep also on ice while loading the samples on the acrylamide gel.c.  Load 0.5~ul of each sample in each well. Between each deposit, rinse the multisyringe in water. Load on the same acrylamide gel the samples which have to be compared, and load the controls on each gel if necessary.5.  Analyze the SSAP multiband fingerprints by scoring polymorphic bands which may correspond to TE insertion site polymorphisms (Figure 1d).

These mutant mice were backcrossed for more than five generations with C57BL/6J. Mice were bred under standard animal housing conditions at 23°C ± 1°C with humidity of 55% and a light/dark cycle of 12 hr, with free access to food and water. Genotyping was performed by PCR using tail genomic DNA. The study protocol meets the guidelines of the Japanese Pharmacological Society and was approved by the Committee for Ethical Use of Experimental Animals at Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. The numbers of animals used per experiment are stated in the figure legends.Skeletal Preparation and Histological AnalysesEmbryos were eviscerated and the skins were removed, and subsequent fixation in 95% ethanol overnight. Embryos were then immersed in Alcian blue solution overnight, and were transferred in a solution of 2% KOH, followed by staining in alizarin red solution overnight. Finally, the skeletons were cleaned with 1% KOH/20% glycerol and then stored in 50% ethanol/50% glycerol (Iezaki et al., 2016).Mouse tibiae were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. Sections were stained with safranin O and von Kossa (Wang et al., 2005). Sections were incubated in a blocking buffer for 1 hr, followed by incubation with anti-phospho-4EBP1 antibody (no. 2855) (Cell Signaling Technologies) or anti-PCNA antibody (no. ab18197) (Abcam) for 24 hr. After washing with PBS, sections were further treated for 2 hr with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (no. BA-1000) (Vector), and subsequent incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase.Generation of Retroviral Vectors and InfectionpMX-CA-S6K and pMX-Sox9 vectors were generated by subcloning into pMX vector from pRK7-HA-S6K1-F5A-E389-R3A (no. 8991) and pWPXL-Sox9 (no. 36979) vectors, respectively, which were obtained from Addgene. The oligonucleotides for 4E-BP1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and 4E-BP2 shRNA were synthesized (Table S1), annealed, and inserted into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ vector. These vectors were then transfected into PLAT-E cells using the calcium carbonate method. Virus supernatant was collected 48 hr after transfection and cells were then infected with this viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/mL polybrene (Fukasawa et al., 2016).Micromass Culture SystemLimb bud mesenchymal cells from E12.5 were treated with 0.1% collagenase and 0.1% dispase for 1.5 hr at 37°C, and subsequently resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 1.5 × 107 cells/mL. Droplets were carefully placed in each well interior of a 4-well plate. Cells were allowed to adhere at 37°C for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of chondrogenic medium (DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid). Medium was changed every 2 days, and Alcian blue stain was performed on day 6.Real-Time qPCRTotal RNA was extracted from cells, followed by the synthesis of cDNA using reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primer. The cDNA samples were then used as templates for real-time PCR analysis, which was performed on an MX3005P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies) using specific primers for each gene (Table S2). Expression levels of the genes examined were normalized using Actb expression as an internal control for each sample.Immunoblotting AnalysisCells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subsequent immunoblotting. The primary antibodies used were, anti-RUNX2 (no. 12556), anti-RAPTOR (no. 2280), anti-phospho-p70S6K1 (no. 9205), anti-p70S6K1 (no. 2708), anti-phospho-4EBP1 (no. 2855), anti-4EBP1 (no. 9644), and anti-4EBP2 (no. 2845) (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-β-actin (no. sc-47778) and anti-SOX6 (no. sc-17332) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SOX9 (no. AB5535) (EMD Millipore).Luciferase AssayPlasmids pIS1 (no. 12179), pIS1-Eef25UTR-renilla (no. 38235), and pIS1-Actb5UTR-renilla (no. 38234) were obtained from Addgene, and plasmids 5′ UTR-Runx2-luc, 5′ UTR-Sox6-luc and 5′ UTR-Sox9-luc were generated by PCR-based cloning with mouse genomic DNA. To generate 5′ UTR-Sox9TOPM-luc, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PrimeSTAR Max Mutagenesis Basal Kit (Takara Bio) with specific primers (Table S3). For the luciferase assay, cells were transfected with reporter vectors using the lipofection method as previously described (Hinoi et al., 2014), followed by the preparation of cell lysates and subsequent determination of luciferase activity using specific substrates in a luminometer (ATTO). Transfection efficiency was normalized by determining the LacZ activity.Polysome FractionCells were incubated with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide for 5 min at 37°C, and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.5], 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.25% NP-40, 100 μg/mL cycloheximide) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and RNase inhibitor. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was then loaded onto ultracentrifuge tubes containing sucrose gradient buffer (10%–40% sucrose) and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 hr with an SW41 rotor. Fraction samples were collected and RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent LS (Sigma). The RNA samples were used for real-time PCR analysis using KAPA SYBR Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems) with specific primers for each gene (Table S4).SEM Observation with Ionic LiquidIonic liquid (IL), HILEM IL1000 (Hitachi High-Technologies) was used as coating reagent as described in previous papers (Ishigaki et al., 2011, Tsuda et al., 2011). In brief, this IL was mixed with pure water prior to use. The mixture was then pre-warmed at 40°C in a block heater to decrease its viscosity. This IL-water mixture was dropped onto the fixed samples and left for 1 min at room temperature. Excess IL was absorbed by paper and blowing away by a hairdryer. Then, the sample was evenly pasted onto an electrical conductive tape (Nisshin EM) that was put on an aluminum sample stub for SEM. A Hitachi S3400N SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies) was used in this study.Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization and ImmunohistochemistryFor whole-mount in situ hybridization, limb buds were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in methanol, rehydrated by a series of methanol/PBS gradient, and treated with 0.2 M HCl and 10 μg/mL proteinase K. Limb buds were then subjected to acetylation in 0.1 M triethanolamine with 0.25% acetic anhydride. After prehybridization, limb buds were incubated with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe at 60°C for 16 hr and subsequently treated with 4 μg/mL RNase A. Limb buds were further incubated with anti-digoxigenin-ALP Fab fragments for 16 hr, followed by treatment with NBT/BCIP.For whole-mount immunohistochemistry, limb buds were fixed with methanol:DMSO (4:1) overnight, and washed three times with 1% Triton X-100/PBS. After treatment with blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum) for 1 hr, limb buds were incubated with anti-SOX9 antibody (no. AB5535) (EMD Millipore) or anti-COL2 antibody (no. ab34712) (Abcam) in blocking buffer for 24 hr. Limb buds were further incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-Rabbit IgG (no. A11008) (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 48 hr.Data AnalysisAll results are expressed as the mean ± SEM, and statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test or one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-hoc test.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC6117477.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Sequencing of Ebola Virus Genomes Using Nanopore Technology","text":"Sequencing of Ebola Virus Genomes Using Nanopore Technology\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: This protocol was established and tested during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in January 2015, using materials and reagents available at that time.

Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Canadian Wonder), soybean (Glycine max cv. Williams82, donated by Suomeng Dong), peanut (Arachis hypogaea cv. Hefeng 6, donated by Boshou Liao), medicago (Medicago truncatula A17, donated by Jian-Kang Zhu), and pea (Pisum sativum cv. Little Marvel) plants were grown under the same conditions as N. benthamiana. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (22 °C under a 10-h light/14-h dark photoperiod with a light-intensity of 100–150 μE m−2 s−1).For pathogen inoculation assays, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) and soybean plants were cultivated in jiffy pots (Jiffy International, Kristiansand, Norway) in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (25 °C with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, 130 μE m−2 s−1, 65% humidity) during 4 or 2 weeks, respectively. After soil-drenching inoculation, the plants were kept in a growth chamber under the following conditions: 27 °C with 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod, a light-intensity of 130 μE m−2 s−1 and 75% humidity.ChemicalsAll the peptides used in this study were purchased from Abclonal (Wuhan, Hubei, China), and the sequences are detailed in the Supplementary Table 2. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.Plasmids, bacterial strains, and cultivation conditionsRalstonia solanacearum GMI1000 and Y45 were grown on solid BG medium37 plates or cultivated over-night in liquid BG medium at 28 °C38. The AtFLS2 (AT5G46330.2) gene was amplified using cDNA as template, cloned in pENTR-D-TOPO (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and subcloned into pGWB50539 by LR reaction (ThermoFisher). The GmFLS2a (Glyma.08g083300.1), GmBAK1 (Glyma.15G051600.1) (with stop codon), and AtBAK1 (AT4G33430.2) (with stop codon) genes were amplified using cDNA as template, cloned in pDONR-207 (ThermoFisher), and subcloned into pGWB505 by LR reaction. The GmFLS2b (Glyma.05g128200.1) gene was amplified, cloned in pDONR-zeocin (ThermoFisher), and subcloned into pGWB505 by LR reaction. The fragments containing GmFLS2a and GmFLS2b were differentiated by sequencing. The BAK1 genes from Arabidopsis and soybean without stop codon cloned in pDONR-207 were also subcloned into pGWB51439. The plasmid co-expressing GmFLS2 and GmBAK1 was generated by Golden Gate technology as summarized in the Supplementary Fig. 15. DNA fragments (level 0 modules) were amplified from pDONR-207 (GmBAK1) or pDONR-zeocin (GmFLS2b) and assembled using BsaI into level 1 vector pICH47751 (GmBAK1 promoter with GmBAK1 cds or YFP) or pICH47761 (35 S promoter with GmFLS2 cds or YFP). The final constructs comprising kanamycin resistance cassette, GmBAK1 and GmFLS2b or YFP were assembled using BpiI into the binary vector pAGM4723. The MoClo Toolkit40 was a gift from Sylvester Marillonnet (Addgene kit #1000000044). Binary vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Agrobacterium) GV3101 for transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves or into Agrobacterium rhizogenes MSU440 for expression in tomato roots (see details below). Agrobacterium carrying binary vectors was grown at 28 °C and 220 rpm in LB medium supplemented with rifampicin (50 mg L−1), gentamycin (25 mg L−1), and spectinomycin (50 mg L−1).Site-directed mutagenesisGmFLS2b mutant variants were generated using the QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Life technologies, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The GmFLS2b/pDONR-zeocin plasmid was used as template. Primers used for the mutagenesis are listed in Supplementary Table 1.Agrobacterium-mediated gene expression in N. benthamianaAgrobacterium-mediated gene expression in N. benthamiana was performed as previously described41. Briefly, Agrobacterium carrying the different plasmids were suspended in infiltration buffer to a final OD600 of 0.25 or 0.5 and infiltrated into the abaxial side of the leaves using a 1 mL needless syringe. Leaf samples were taken at 2 to 3 dpi (days post infiltration) for analysis based on experimental requirements.Protein extraction and western blotsProtein extraction and western blots were performed as previously described41. Briefly, plant tissues were collected into 2 mL tubes with metal beads and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After grinding with a tissue lyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 1 min at 25 rpm s−1, proteins were extracted using protein extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5; 10% glycerol; 2% NP40, 5 mM EDTA; 2 mM dithiothreitol; 1X proteinase inhibitor cocktail; 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM Na2MoO4, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10 min; 15,000 × g), the supernatants were mixed with SDS loading buffer, denatured at 70 °C for 20 min, and resolved using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and monitored by western blot using anti-GFP (Abicode, CA, USA, M0802-3a) and anti-HA (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, No.11583816001) antibodies. Both antibodies were diluted 1:5000.Measurement of ROS generation and MAPK activationPAMP-triggered ROS burst and MAPK activation in plant leaves were measured as described previously42,43. ROS in tomato roots was measured as described previously13. Briefly, plant tissues were placed in 96-well plates containing distilled water, and ROS was elicited with 100 nM flg22Psy, flg22Rso or 100 nM of the indicated recombinant proteins. Luminescence was measured over 60 min using a microplate luminescence reader (Varioskan flash, Thermo Scientific, USA). MAPK activation assays were performed using 5-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Two days after Agrobacterium infiltration at OD600 of 0.25, the intact leaves were elicited for 10 min after syringe infiltration of 1 μM flg22. Leaf discs were taken to monitor MAPK activation by western blot with anti-Phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Erk1/2; Thr-202/Tyr-204, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, 4370S). Anti-MAPK antibody was diluted 1:5000.Ralstonia solanacearum virulence assaysR. solanacearum soil-drenching inoculation was performed as previously described38 with specific modifications. Soybean or tomato plants grown in Jiffy pots for 12–14 and 21–28 days, respectively, were inoculated by drenching the soil with a bacterial suspension containing 108 colony-forming units per mL (CFU mL−1). 35 mL of a suspension of R. solanacearum GM1000 was used to soak each pot. After incubation for 20 min with the bacterial inoculum, plants were transferred from the bacterial solution to a bed of potting mixture soil in a new tray44. Scoring of visual disease symptoms on the basis of a scale ranging from ‘0’ (no symptoms) to ‘4’ (complete wilting)44. To perform survival analysis, the disease scoring was transformed into binary data with the criteria: a disease index lower than 2 was defined as ‘0’, while a disease index equal or higher than 2 was defined as ‘1’ in terms of the corresponding time (days post-inoculation, dpi)45.Stem injection assays with R. solanacearum were performed as previously described46. Briefly, 10 μL of a 106 CFU mL−1 bacterial suspension was injected into the stems of 4-week-old tomato plants and 2-week-old soybean plants. Injections were performed in the cotyledon emerging site in the stem, and photographs were taken at the indicated time points.For R. solanacearum infiltration in N. benthamiana leaves, GmFLS2/GmBAK1 or GmBAK1 (as control) were expressed in the same N. benthamiana leaf using Agrobacterium with a final OD600 of 0.25. PAMP-induced resistance assays were performed following the original procedure for Arabidopsis plants33, with several modifications in our experimental system. Briefly, 24 h after Agrobacterium infiltration, water (as control) or a 1 μM solution of the indicated peptides was infiltrated into the leaves. Twelve hours after infiltration of the peptides, a 106 CFU mL−1 inoculum of R. solanacearum Y4534 was infiltrated into the same tissues. R. solanacearum Y45 was originally isolated from tobacco47, and is able to replicate rapidly upon infiltration into N. benthamiana leaves34. This strain has been transformed with the pRCT-orange plasmid to confer resistance to tetracycline. Samples were taken 1 or 2 dpi to quantify CFU per gram of tissue. CFU were counted by spreading serial dilutions on solid BG medium containing kanamycin (10 mg/l) to allow the selection of Y45 CFU.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described41 with several modifications. Briefly, N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with Agrobacterium containing pGWB505-GmFLS2 (or mutant variants) and pGWB514-GmBAK1 or pGWB505-AtFLS2 and pGWB514-AtBAK1. Forty-eight hours after Agrobacterium infiltration, leaves were treated with water (as control), or a solution containing 1 μM of the indicated peptides for 10 min. Total proteins were extracted as indicated above and immunoprecipitation was performed with 15 μL of GFP-trap beads (ChromoTek, Munich, Germany) with 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5 times with wash buffer with 1% NP40. The proteins were stripped from the beads by heating in 30 µL Laemmli buffer for 20 min at 70 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels for western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies.Confocal microscopyConfocal imaging was performed as previously described48. Briefly, GmFLS2-GFP and mutant variants were expressed in N. benthamiana using Agrobacterium. Samples were imaged 2.5 days later on a Leica TCS SMD FLCS point scanning confocal microscope using the settings for visualizing GFP fluorescence with laser excitation: 488 nm, emission: 500–550 nm.FRET-FLIMFӧrster resonance energy transfer—fluorescence lifetime imaging (FRET-FLIM) experiments were performed as previously described49,50 with several modifications. Briefly, GmFLS2b (fused to GFP) was expressed from pGWB505, and GmBAK1 (fused to RFP) or free RFP (as negative control) were expressed from pGWB554. FRET-FLIM experiments were performed on a Leica TCS SMD FLCS confocal microscope excitation with WLL (white light laser) and emission collected by a SMD SPAD (single photon-sensitive avalanche photodiodes) detector. Two days after infiltration, N. benthamiana plants transiently co-expressing donor and acceptor proteins were treated either with water or 1 μM flg22Rso, as indicated in the figures, and visualized under the microscope 15–30 min after treatment. Accumulation of the GFP- and RFP-tagged proteins was estimated before measuring lifetime. The tuneable WLL set at 488 nm with a pulsed frequency of 40 MHz was used for excitation, and emission was detected using SMD GFP/RFP Filter Cube (with GFP: 500–550 nm). The fluorescence lifetime shown in the figures corresponding to the average fluorescence lifetime of the donor was collected and analysed by PicoQuant SymphoTime software. Lifetime is normally amplitude-weighted mean value using the data from the single (GFP-fused donor protein only or GFP-fused donor protein with free RFP acceptor or with non-interacting RFP-fused acceptor protein) or biexponential fit (GFP-fused donor protein interacting with RFP-fused acceptor protein). Mean lifetimes are presented as mean ± SEM based on eight images from three independent experiments.Tomato root transformationTomato root transformation was performed using Agrobacterium rhizogenes MSU44051. Radicles of tomato seedlings were cut 7 days after germination, and the bottom of the hypocotyls were incubated with Agrobacterium rhizogenes MSU440 carrying plasmids to express GmFLS2/GmBAK1 and YFP/YFP (as control), and selected using plates of Murashige-Skoog medium containing kanamycin (50 mg L−1). The responsiveness conferred by the expressed soybean genes was validated by determining the ROS burst triggered by flg22Rso (100 nM). Three weeks after transformation, seedlings were transferred to Jiffy pots, and soil-drenching inoculation with R. solanacearum (OD600 of 0.01) was performed three-to-four weeks later as described above. Symptoms were scored as described above.Obtaining the initial models used in the structural analysisInitial atomic coordinates for the AtFLS2/AtBAK1/flg22Pae ternary complex were obtained from the published crystal structure of flg22 in complex with the FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains5 available from the Protein Data Bank under pdb ID 4mn8. The C-terminus alanine of flg22Pae was manually added and oriented based on visual inspection of the electron density data. To obtain coordinates for the AtFLS2/AtBAK1/flg22Rso complex, the 9 residue modifications were modelled using the FoldX computer algorithm52. Prior to any mutagenesis, the RepairPDB option of FoldX was used to optimize the total energy of the triplex, by identifying and repairing those residues that have bad torsion angles and van der Waals clashes. Mutagenesis was performed using the BuildModel option of FoldX, allowing for rotamer and sidechain orientation optimization of the mutated residues and neighbour residues both in the flg22 peptide and the receptor proteins. Finally, the initial atomic coordinates for the GmFLSb/GmBAK1/flg22Rso were obtained following a stepwise approach: primary sequence alignment with BLAST53 of the GmFLS2b and GmBAK1 extracellular domains to the AtFLS2 and AtBAK1 sequence templates separately; based on the sequence alignments, putative 3D models for GmFLS2b and GmBAK1 were generated by comparative homology modelling with Swiss model;54 the model structures were then structurally aligned with MUSTANG55 to the equilibrated triplex structure of AtFLS2/AtBAK1/flg22Rso to obtain a complete set of atomic positions; clashed were removed using the RepairPDB option of FoldX.Model refinement by molecular dynamics equilibrationAll complex structures were further optimised by performing explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions within a rectangular cell using the AMBER 18 suite of programs, with the pmemd.cuda module for GPUs56, molecular interactions were represented with the ff14SB force field for proteins57, Dang parameters for the ions58 and SPC/E water59. The system was neutralized with 28 sodium ions placed at random within the simulation cell. The complex was then solvated with a layer of water at least 10 Å thick. Long-range electrostatic effects were treated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method with standard defaults60, using a real-space cutoff of 10 Å. The length of chemical bonds involving hydrogen were restrained using SHAKE61 and the Berendsen algorithm was used to control the temperature and the pressure62, with a coupling constant of 5 ps. In order to equilibrate the complex side chains and solvent shell, a multistep protocol was followed, which involves energy minimizations of the solvent while keeping the solute rigid, slow thermalization and a final equilibration for 10 ns with position restraints on the backbone atoms. Visualization of states was conducted in PyMOL 2.3 molecular graphics system software, using PyMOL Tcl script language.Binding free energy estimationsThe change in binding free energy upon mutation from flg22Pae to flg22Rso was estimated using the BeAtMuSiC program63 based on the structure of the protein–protein complex. Given that it has been suggested that the recognition of flg22 by the FLS2/BAK1 receptor complex takes place in two distinct steps5, involving first the binding of flg22 to FLS2, followed by the recruitment of BAK1, binding free energy changes were calculated separately for the AtFLS2 + flg22 complex and for the triplex formation step. The latter refers to the binding energy of BAK1 to the already formed complex of AtFLS2/flg22. Alanine Scanning of the all interface residues in the complex was performed using the Robetta server64. The procedure identifies residues that are involved in the protein–protein interface, and uses a simple free energy function to calculate the changes in the binding free energy upon single substitutions of each side-chain to alanine. Here also, the two presumed stages of the recognition process were analysed separately, first the binding of flg22 to AtFLS2, then the binding of AtBAK1 to the complex formed by the other two. This analysis was interpreted to reveal hotspots in the structure where polymorphisms between plant species might have evolved for the recognition of the flg22Rso.Phylogenetic analysis of flg22Rso sequencesThe flg22 sequences extracted from 155 sequenced R. solanacearum strains were kindly provided by Nemo Peeters. The name of the sequenced strains and the metadata associated to the genome sequences has been previously published65.Recombinant protein purification from Escherichia coliThe recombinant GFP and full-length FliC (flagellin) used in this work were purified in a previous study13. Mass-spectrometry analysis of the recombinant proteins and other details about the purification process were published before13.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed with Prism 5 software (GraphPad). The data are presented as mean ± SEM. The statistical analysis methods are described in the figure legends.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7387336.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Detection of piggyBac-mediated Transposition by Splinkerette PCR in Transgenic Lines of Strongyloides ratti","text":"Detection of piggyBac-mediated Transposition by Splinkerette PCR in Transgenic Lines of Strongyloides ratti\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Collect stably transformed free-living adult Strongyloides from charcoal cultures of fresh host feces incubated at ^22 ^°C for 48h (Lok, 2007).  Extract genomic DNA (gDNA) from 500 freeliving adult worms using the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit. Parasites do not need to be homogenized.  Isolated worms are pelleted at 14,000×g and then substituted for the “ground tissue” in step 2, followed by step 2b of the manufacturer’s protocol accompanying the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit, using reagent volumes recommended for tissue samples of 5-10~mg~ . Resuspend extracted gDNA in 50~ul TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, p H8.0AA ) to yield ~ 25n g/ul .2.  Digest Genomic DNA (100n g) with BstYI, BamHI, and Bgl II for ^2h in a total volume of 15~ul for each reaction (Figure 1A).

Add 5~ul of 100  uM SPLINK-BOT  oligonucleotide, 5~uI00~uM SPLINK-GATC-TOP oligonucleotide and 10× NEB Buffer 2 in a total reaction volume of 100ul . Heat to 95~^°C for 3 min then cool on bench to room temperature to anneal splinkerette oligonucleotides. Ligate digested gDNA with GATC sticky ends to annealed splinkerette oligonucleotides using T4 ligase for ^8h at 16~^°C in a total volume of 30ul (Figure 1B).4.  Two rounds of spPCR are conducted following ligation of genomic DNA restriction fragments to splinkerette oligo nucleotides.a.  For the first round of spPCR, combine primer SPLINK#1, which targets the ligated splinkerette oligonucleotides, with either primer 3’SPLNK-PB#1 or primer 5’SPLNK-PB#1. 3’SPLNK-PB#1 and 5’SPLNK-PB#1 target the 3^ and 5' ends of the transgene sequences, respectively.

Each strain was grown at pH 6.8 under anaerobiosis in a rich medium established for Thermococcales (TRM; Zeng et al., 2009) containing 3% NaCl and 10 g L–1 elemental sulfur, with the exception of Thermococcus waiotapuensis and Thermococcus zilligii, which were grown with 0.6% NaCl. Pyrococcus species were all grown at 98°C, whereas Palaeococcus and Thermococcus species were grown at 85°C, with the exception of Thermococcus piezophilus and Thermococcus sibiricus, which were grown at 75°C. Before growth, the medium was reduced by adding Na2S (0.1% final concentration). To confirm the assumptions based on our literature survey, additional strains were grown under their respective optimal conditions and included: Aciduliprofundum boonei DSM19572 (Reysenbach et al., 2006), Aeropyrum pernix DSM11879 (Sako et al., 1996), Halobacterium salinarum DSM3754 (Pfeiffer et al., 2019), Haloferax volcanii DSM3757 (Torreblanca et al., 1986), Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus DSM1053 (Schönheit et al., 1980), Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM2661 (Jones et al., 1983), Natronomonas pharaonis DSM2160 (Tindall et al., 1984), Pyrobaculum islandicum DSM4184 (Huber et al., 1987), and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM639 (Langworthy et al., 1974). Growth was monitored by counting with a Thoma cell, and growth curves were established for each species.Lipid Extraction and AnalysisCultures (250 mL) in the late exponential phase were centrifuged (4000 × g, 45 min, 4°C) and rinsed twice with an isotonic solution. The cell pellets were then lyophilized overnight and kept at −80°C until cell hydrolysis, followed by lipid extraction. Lipid extraction was performed on three biological replicates for each strain.Previous studies of the lipid composition of solvent extracts from archaeal cells and environmental samples have illustrated possible analytical biases due to the selective extraction of some lipid classes over others (Huguet et al., 2010; Cario et al., 2015). To account for this disadvantage, lyophilized cells were directly hydrolyzed to remove polar head groups from the core lipids, which could then be quantitatively extracted (Cario et al., 2015). However, this procedure can also result in the removal of additional hydroxyl groups and the destruction of (poly)unsaturated lipids, and thus possibly reduce the retrieved lipid diversity. Following acid methanolysis of the dried cells (1.2 N HCl in methanol at 110°C for 3 h), core lipids were extracted by filtration over celite using methanol/dichloromethane (1:1, v/v). The resulting solvent extracts were dried under reduced pressure, solubilized in n-hexane/isopropanol or n-heptane/isopropanol (99:1, v/v) and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS) using an HP 1100 series LC-MS instrument equipped with an auto-injector and a Chemstation chromatography manager software. The analytical conditions were modified after Cario et al. (2015) (Cario et al., 2015). Separations were achieved on a Prevail Cyano 3 microns column (150 mm × 2.1 mm; Grace Davison Discovery Sciences) maintained at 30°C. Injection volume was of 10 μl. Core lipids were eluted with a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1, using the following gradient: 95% B (5 min isocratic) to 65% B in 30 min (5 min isocratic), then to 0% B in 1 min (10 min isocratic), and back to 95% B in 1 min (5 min isocratic), with A = 95% n-heptane : 5% isopropanol (v/v) and B = 100% n-heptane. Detection was achieved using an Esquire 3000+ ion trap mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure positive ion chemical ionization source (APCI-MS). Conditions for MS analyses were: nebulizer pressure 50 psi, APCI temperature 420°C, drying temperature 350°C, drying gas (N2) flow 5 L min–1, capillary voltage −2 kV, corona 4 μA, scan range m/z 600–2200. Under our analytical conditions, dialkyl glycerol diether with isoprenyl chains with 20 carbons (DGD) and its macrocyclic derivative, and diethers with one or two isoprenyl chains with 25 carbons were the only forms of diether lipids detected, whereas three tetraether structures were identified, namely glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT), glycerol trialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GTGT), and glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (GMGT) (for lipid structures, refer to Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). A standard solution containing core DGD and GDGT-0 in a 2/1 molar ratio highlighted a molar response factor of DGD ca. 10 times lower than that of GDGT-0. A response factor of 1 was assumed between DGD and the other diethers and between GDGT-0 and the other tetraethers. For each archaeal species, core lipid relative abundances were determined by integration of the peak area on the mass chromatograms corresponding to the [M+H]+ ion of the different core lipids, and the relative abundances of diethers were corrected by a factor of 10 relative to that of tetraethers.FIGURE 1HPLC chromatogram (top) and lipid core structures (bottom) recovered from Pyrococcus furiosus after direct cell methanolysis (HCl/MeOH, 110°C). Cells were grown in TRM under optimal conditions. (1) Diphytanyl glycerol diether (DGD, green), (2 and 2a) glycerol trialkyl glycerol tetraethers with 0 (GTGT-0, dark blue) and 1 cyclopentane ring (GTGT-1, light blue), (3–3d) glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers with 0–4 rings (GDGT-0 to 4, dark to light purple) and (4 and 4a) glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers with 0 (GMGT-0, dark red) and 1 ring (GMGT-1, light red). [M+H]+: mass/charge ratio.Statistical AnalysesStatistical analyses were computed in R (version 3.4.2; R Core Team, 2017). Principle component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the lipid proportions to determine the relative data dispersion for each strain. Due to the sparsity of the ring-containing core lipids in Thermococcales, the analysis was performed on the total proportions of each type of lipid skeleton, combining both cyclic and acyclic core structures, namely, DGD, GDGT, GMGT and GTGT (for lipid structures, refer to Figure 1). The Thermococcales average number of cyclopentane rings per lipid structure was represented by the RI calculated as follows (Schouten et al., 2007):R⁢I=G⁢D⁢G⁢T-1+G⁢M⁢G⁢T-1+G⁢T⁢G⁢T-1+2×G⁢D⁢G⁢T-2+3×G⁢D⁢G⁢T-3+4×G⁢D⁢G⁢T-4G⁢D⁢G⁢T-0+G⁢M⁢G⁢T-0+G⁢T⁢G⁢T-0+G⁢D⁢G⁢T-1+G⁢M⁢G⁢T-1+G⁢T⁢G⁢T-1+G⁢D⁢G⁢T-2+G⁢D⁢G⁢T-3+G⁢D⁢G⁢T-4To correlate the environmental conditions and the core lipid compositions of Thermococcales, a classical canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was conducted using the lipid relative abundances and the physical and chemical properties of the hydrothermal vents from which each strain was isolated. The hydrothermal fluid composition was unavailable for 19 out of the 51 analyzed strains, and the CCA analysis was conducted based on 32 strains. Missing values for the 16 corresponding hydrothermal vents were estimated using the missMDA R package (Josse and Husson, 2016). Briefly, the package attributes a random, yet likely, value to the missing data based on similarities between individuals and links between variables. This value is then optimized through iterative PCA, until the algorithm reaches convergence. Data were not scaled prior to estimation, and the number of components used for estimating the missing values was set to 5, the optimal number of components determined by missMDA. This process resulted in positive estimated values, in agreement with the physical and chemical nature of the measured parameters (Supplementary Table S1). The variability in the missing value prediction was estimated using multiple imputations and the k-fold cross validation method implemented in missMDA (Josse and Husson, 2016). The prediction of the missing values of our dataset displayed a great variability across imputations, thus reducing the confidence in the estimated values, and therefore in the variables with initially missing values (i.e., Sr, Fe, Mn and H2S). The CCA was then performed using the CCA R package (González et al., 2008) on lipid composition (DGD, GDGT, GMGT, GTGT, and RI) and environmental condition matrices using the first two substantial canonical correlations.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7137397.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Library Construction for Genome-wide Bisulfite Sequencing in Plants David Moraga Amador1, Chenggang Wang2, Kevin H.

Workflow of library construction for genome-wide bisulfite sequencingA.  DNA fragmentation by ultrasonic destruction1.  Dissolve 2~u of high quality, high molecular weight genomic DNA extracted from Arabidopsis leaf tissues in 130~ul TE buffer and transfer to a 6×16~mm glass microtube with AFA fiber with pre-slit snap-caps. Genomic DNA extracted using the commonly used CTAB (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) method is suitable as long as the genomic DNA runs at a high molecular weight (>2~kb) and as a clean single band in 0.8% agarose gel. The quality of genomic DNA can also be monitored with the 2100 BioAnalyzer (Figure 2A).()Figure 2. BioAnalyzer traces of an Arabidopsis DNA sample (OE) that was processed through the workflow of the procedure described in this protocol.A. Genomic DNA; B. Ultrasonically fragmented DNA; C. Ultrasonically fragmented and magnetic bead cleaned up DNA; D. Adaptor-ligated DNA fragments recovered by the agarose gel-based selection; E. The final sequencing library (post PCR amplification).2.  Shear the genomic DNA into fragments with an average size of 300 bp in the S2 adaptive focus acoustic disruptor using the following settings (for fragmenting DNA with the majority of fragments in the 150-450 bp range) (Figure 2B): Duty cycle 10% Intensity 4 Cycles/burst 200 Time 132 sec Temperature 6^°C The S2 instrument is connected to the refrigerated water bath circulator that is set at 6~^°C in order to maintain a constant temperature during the sonication process.3.  Transfer to a 1.5~m~l~ microcentrifuge tube, and estimate the recovered volume with a pipettor. Typically, 125ul of the DNA solution is recovered.4.  Add a suspension (slur) of AMPure magnetic beads at a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.73:1 (v/v). This bead-to-sample ratio is used to collect DNA fragments over 200 bp prior to construction of the sequencing library.5.  Incubate the mix at room temperature for 15 min with shaking at 700 rpm in the Thermomixer R to allow DNA to bind with the beads.6.  Pulse spin to collect the mix at the bottom of the tube, and then put the tube on the magnetic stand for 1-2 min until the solution is completely clear. The magnetic beads will be attracted to the magnet, thus allowing removal of the supernatant. Remove and discard the supernatant.7.  Leave the tube on the magnetic stand and wash the beads twice as follows: for each wash add 1 ml of freshly prepared 70% ethanol, gently pipet the beads up and down six times, let the beads sit for 30-60 sec, and then discard the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the beads.8.  Following the second wash, pulse spin the tube to collect traces of ethanol, and then place the tube on the magnetic stand. Remove ethanol traces with a fine-tipped pipettor.9.  Air dry the magnetic beads for 1 to 3 min at room temperature.10. Elute DNA as follows: remove the tube from the magnetic stand and place on a plastic rack, add 30~ul of elution buffer, vortex vigorously for 10 sec, place the tube back on the magnetic stand until the solution becomes completely clear, and then use a pipettor to transfer the supernatant containing the DNA into a clean microcentrifuge tube. Repeat the elution by adding another 30~ul of elution buffer as above. Pool the two eluate fractions.11. Save 3 ul of the DNA sample for quantification in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer according to the product instructions (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/Q32854)and for fragment size confirmation with the 2100 BioAnalyzer (Figure 2C). The desired size range of the fragments should be 200-450 bp.At this point the DNA can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# B.  Library constructionSequencing libraries are made using the low-throughput TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (TruSeq DNA sample preparation guide) with a few modifications (see below). The adaptors included in this kit are methylated and are therefore compatible with bisulfite sequencing for DNA methylation analysis.1.  End repair the DNA fragments in the following reaction: 50ul above DNA sample (1.5u) 10ul end-repair reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 40ul end-repair mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 30~^°C for 30 min. Clean up the reaction mix with AMPure magnetic beads as described above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10), except that the bead-tosample ratio is 1:1 (v/v).  Elute DNA in 17.5ul elution buffer. This bead-to-sample ratio is used to collect essentially all DNA fragments.2. z -adenylate the end-repaired DNA fragments in the following reaction: 15ul end-repaired DNA 2.5ul3\" -adenylation reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 12.5ul A-tailing mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 37^°C for 30 m i n . The adenylation mix is compatible with the ligation reaction; therefore, no clean-up is necessary at this step.3.  Ligate methylated adaptors to the 3^ -adenylated DNA fragments in the following reaction: 30ul adenylated DNA (the entire adenylation reaction from step B2) 2.5ul ligation reaction buffer (included in the TruSeq Kit) 2.5ul ligation mix (included in the TruSeq Kit) 2.5ul adaptors (included in the TruSeq Kit) Incubate at 30~^°C for 10m i n . Add 5~ul of ligation stop buffer. Clean-up sample using AMPure magnetic beads as described above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10). with a 1:1 (v/v) bead-to-sample ratio. Elute adaptor-ligated DNA in 22.5ul elution buffer.4.  Size-select adaptor-ligated DNA fragments (250-500 bp) in a 2% TAE agarose gel as follows. Prepare 100ml of the solution in a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask, heat in a microwave oven until agarose is fully dissolved, add SYBR Safe stain (1:10,000 v/v dye-to-gel ratio) to the molten agarose solution and swirl to mix, and then pour the gel-dye solution into properly set-up casting of the gel electrophoresis apparatus. A 10-well comb is placed at one end of the gel casting tray to form wells. Allow gel to fully solidify (30 m i n) . Load a50 bp ladder in one of the gel wells to aid in size estimation. Mix the sample with a suitable sample loading dye and load into any of the additional wells. Connect electrodes to power supply and electrophorese at 100or until the quickest moving dye reaches _3/4 of the gel length from the wells.  No post electrophoresis staining is necessary when the dye is added as suggested here. SYBR Safe is used instead of ethidium bromide in order to avoid UV damage (during viewing) of DNA fragments. View the gel on a Safe Imager 2.0 blue light transilluminator. Cut the gel region containing fragments in the 250-500 bp range using a sterile, disposable scalpel (Figure 3). Transfer the gel slice into a DNA LoBind _2.0 m centrifuge tube. If gel slices are too large, they can be placed in a 15~ml conical tube. After the agarose gel is dissolved (see step 5 below), split dissolved volume if necessary into DNA LoBind 2.0ml tubes for DNA extraction.()Figure 3. Size selection of adaptor-ligated DNA fragments in an agarose gel. Two Arabidopsis genomic DNA samples (A and B) were fragmented in the S2 adaptive focus acoustic disruptor, end-repaired, 3. -adenylated, adaptor-ligated, and separated in a 2% TAE agarose gel. Gel wells were formed using a 10-well-forming comb (8 mm wide wells). Ten ul of ready-to-load 50 bp ladder were loaded in the flanking positions of the samples in the gel for excision process. Left: before excision; Right: post excision.5.  Extract  DNA  from  the  gel  using  the  QIAquick  gel  extraction  kit  following  the manufacturer's instructions (http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sampletechnologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-gel-extractionkit#resources). Elute DNA with 22 µl elution buffer (included in the QIAquick gel extraction kit).6.  Set aside 2ul to quantitate the library in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with a Qubit dsDNA HSassay kit according to the product instructions (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/Q32854). The final library  yield using  this  protocol  is  usually  300-400  ng  (Figure  2D),  which  corresponds  to  a concentration of 13-18 DNA ng/ µl.At this point the DNA library can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# C. Bisulfite treatmentThe entire library (300-400 ng) is subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EpiTectbisulfite kit following the manufacturer's instructions(http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/assay-technologies/epigenetics/epitect-bisulfite-kits- resources). Briefly:1.  Prepare buffer BW, buffer BD, carrier RNA, buffer BL, and bisulfite mix following the instructions in the kit.2.  Treat DNA with bisulfite in the following reaction: 20ul DNA (the entire library) 85ul bisulfite mix (included in the EpiTect kit) 35ul DNA protect buffer (included in the EpiTect kit) Incubate at the following conditions in a thermal cycler: 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 25m i n , 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 85~m i n , 95~^°C for 5 min, 60~^°C for 175min , and finally hold at ^20^°C .3.  Purify the bisulfite-converted DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute DNA twice, each time with 20~ul elution buffer (included in the EpiTect kit) and pool the two eluate fractions.4.  Further  purify  and  concentrate  the  DNA  using  a  MinElute  column  following  the instructions in the MinElute PCR purification kit (http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sampletechnologies/dna-cleanup/minelute-pcr-purification-kit#resources). Elute DNA in 15~ul elution buffer (included in the MinElute PCR purification kit). At this point the bisulfite-converted library can be stored at -20~^°C for later use.# D.  Library enrichment1.  Amplify 1 ng of the bisulfite-converted library using a uracil-insensitive PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase and the primer cocktail included in the Illumina TruSeq library construction kit in the following reaction: 17.25ul double-distilled water 15 µl DNA template 1 ng, usually the entire eluate of the above library) 5 µl Pfu Turbo Buffer (coming with the Pfu Turbo polymerase) 2.5 µl DMSO1.25 µl dNTPs (10 mM) 5ul primer cocktail (included in the TruSeq Kit)1ul Pfu Turbo Cx Hotstart polymeraseThe amplification conditions are: denaturation at 98^°C for 30 sec, 14-18 cycles 98~^°C for 15 sec, 60~^°C for 30 sec, and 72~^°C for 1 m i n ), and final extension at 72~^°C for 5m i n . Depending on the yield of the bisulfite treatment step, the number of PCR amplification cycles should be as small as possible. This step is to selectively enrich DNA library fragments that have methylated adaptors at both ends, and to generate sufficient DNA for accurate quantitation.2.  Clean the PCR amplification products twice using AMPure magnetic beads as describe above (DNA Fragmentation section: steps A4-10) with a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.85:1 (v/v). Elute DNA in 30~ul of elution buffer.  This bead-to-sample ratio is used to remove dNTPs and primers while retaining all the DNA amplification fragments above 150 bp.3.  Use 1~ul of the DNA sample for fragment size confirmation with the 2100 BioAnalyzer. The average insert size of the library generated by this protocol is 360 bp (Figure 2E). A different average size can be obtained by adjusting the DNA ultrasonic fragmentation conditions (DNA fragmentation section: step A2) and by choosing the desired range at the size selection step (Library construction section: step B4).4.  Use 1 µl of the DNA sample for quantification in the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and 1~ul for quantification by qPCR with the KAPA library quantification kit on the ABI7900HT realtime PCR system. This amplification protocol results in 50-200 ng of library in 26ul . The library is now ready for sequencing. If necessary, the library concentration is adjusted to 10 nM by diluting with Elution buffer (see recipes) and submitted for sequencing.# Recipes1. Elution buffer 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)2.

The design and implementation of this work has been approved by a local ethical committee.Sample Processing and SequencingSamples were collected and processed as per the guidelines of the Institutional Ethics Committee. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs collected in viral transport media as explained in Supplementary Methods. Purified RNA was sequenced using either a shotgun approach or the ARTIC v3 protocol, as detailed in Supplementary Methods [5].Assembly of Sequencing DataQuality control of the FASTQ files was performed using FastQC v0.11.7, and adaptors/poor quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic [6, 7]. Reads were aligned to the reference genome MN908947.3 using hisat2 [8]. Consensus sequence from the bam file was derived using seqtk and bcftools [9]. Samtools depth command was used to calculate the coverage across the genome [10]. The sequences were deposited in GISAID with accessions detailed in Supplementary Data 1.Data AvailabilityAll sequences generated in this study have been submitted to GISAID. The accession names of the samples and associated metadata are outlined in Supplementary Data 1.Genomic Data Collection and AnalysisThe datasets of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID (until August 7, 2020) were used for the analysis. Furthermore, 10 high-quality genomes from each of the 10 clades, respectively, as annotated by Nextstrain were retrieved from GISAID and used in the analysis. The datasets and acknowledgments are listed in Supplementary Data 2. We considered only high-quality genomes for evaluation of the nucleotide substitution rates, molecular clock, and phylogenetic clustering, because these would be sensitive to the quality of genomes. The criteria used for filtering low-quality genomes are outlined in Supplementary Methods.Phylogenetic Analysis and Divergence EstimationPhylogenetic analysis of the samples was performed as detailed previously following the standard protocol for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes provided by Nextstrain [11, 12]. BEAST v1.10.4 was used for the analysis of nucleotide substitution rates and the estimation of times to the most recent common ancestor. The detailed methodology for phylogenetic tree construction and dating analysis is provided in Supplementary Methods. The resulting tree was used to infer mutations and identify clades. The values used for each parameter in the protocol are given in Supplementary Data 4.Functional Evaluation of VariantsWuhan-Hu-1 genome (NC_045512) was used as reference wherever applicable. The variants were also evaluated for the functional consequences using SIFT [13]. A SIFT score of 0.0 to 0.05 was interpreted to have a deleterious effect. The functional effects of protein variants identified in the clades were assessed using the PROVEAN web server, using a default threshold value of −2.5 [14]. In addition, PhyloP conservation scores and base-wise GERP rejected substitutions scores for the variants were computed [15, 16]. Sites having positive PhyloP scores were predicted to be conserved, whereas positive GERP scores were considered indicative of a site under evolutionary constraint. The variants were also checked for overlaps with immune epitope predictions as given on UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7543508.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Purification and TEM of Afp and Its Variants","text":"Purification and TEM of Afp and Its Variants\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: All solutions, unless otherwise specified, were prepared with distilled deionised Millipore-microfiltered (MilliQ) water, autoclaved for 15 min at 1.1k g/c m^2 at 121~^°C and stored at room temperature.

Protect  microorganism  preservation  System  (Technical  Service  Consultants)  for preservation of E. . coli cells at -80~^°C Note: When required, a single inoculated bead was removed from the vial and dropped into a LB broth containing the appropriate antibiotic.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nNote: Centrifugation steps were performed at _4° C unless otherwise noted.Afp purification protocol1.  A single inoculating bead (Protect Microorganism Preservation System) from the -80~^°C stock of an appropriate Afp or its derivatives bearing E . coli strain is used to inoculate 3 ml of LB with the respective antibiotics.2.  The culture is incubated overnight at 37~^°C with agitation at 250 rpm (overnight culture).3.  1 ml of the overnight culture is used to inoculate 50m of fresh LB with appropriate antibiotic/s.4.  The 50ml of the cell culture is grown at 37~^°C with agitation to an OD600 of 1.0. Note: O D_600 measurements are taken from the cell cultures diluted with the LB media at ratios of 1:10. A cuvette with LB medium is used as a blank.5.  The cells are transferred into sterile falcon tubes (50~m) and harvested by centrifugation at 2,268× g for 10 min at room temperature.6.  The cell pellets are resuspended in fresh 50ml0.4× LB broth with respective antibiotic/s. Note: Initially 1 ml of the 0.4x~~L B broth is added to each pellet and the pellet is resuspended by vigorous taping on the tube. Then the tube is filled up to 5Om I with 0.4x LB broth and the content of the tube is transferred to the same 50 ml flask as the culture was grown. Antibiotics are added directly to the flask.7. 500~ul of steril filtered 20% arabinose (final concentration 0.2% ) is added to each 50~ml culture to induce the protein expression. Note: After arabinose is added, avoid shaking the cultures.8.  The cultures are incubated for a further ^24h at ^22^°C at 40 rpm.9.  The induced cells are harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,268× g . Note: Higher centrifugation speed (4,629× g for 10 min) may be nessessary if pellet is too loose.10. The pellet from each 50m l culture is re-suspended at 4~^°C in 0.8m pre-chilled TM buffer.11. The  resultant  approximately 0.9 ~ml re-suspensions  are  transferred  into 1.7~~~m~l~~ microcentrifuge tubes and subjected to three 20-sec rounds of sonication using a Sanyo Soniprep 150 Sonicator (18~Omega) . At least 1 min of incubation on ice is included between sonication steps.12. One μl (10 units) of the DNase is added and the sample is left at room temperature for 10 min.13. Following the DNase incubation step the suspension is centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4^°C .14. The pellets are discarded and clear supernatants containing soluble recombinant protein are filtered through 0.45-µm-pore-size filters. Notes:a.  If the samples need to be stored for 1-2 days, 0.02% (final concentration) NaN3 is added to each tube.b. Storage longer than 2 days was not tested; however for a better reproducibility it is recomended to proceed with the purification immediately after this step.15. The resin is packed into a 1.5×50 cm (D×L) column according to the manufacturers’ instructions, resulting in a column bed 1.5 cm in diameter and 46 cm in height. Note: The SEC column can be reused.16. The column is attached to the BioLogic LP System and equilibrated with 150-200 ml TBS at a flow rate of 2m l/m i n .17. Protein solution is then loaded and eluted in a 65m of buffer at 0.5ml/min at room temperature. Elution of protein was monitored by absorbance at 280~n m with the typical OD280 values of 0.01-0.2. SEC protocol:()18. The 1.5~ml fractions from the elution peak (approximately 75-90 min retention time) are collected and pooled as follows: fraction numbers 18-27 (pool I); 28-31 (pool II); 32-46 (pool III).Note: The pool II usually contains the Afp or its derivates with the least amount of cellular contaminants, while pool I and III contain less concentrated Afp particles with higher amounts of cellular contaminants. However, due to slight variations in column filling density, the fractions to be pooled have to be determined experimentally each time the column is repoured.19. The pooled SEC fractions containing Afp or its derivatives are centrifuged at 151, 139xg for one hour and 10 m i n at 4~^°C in a Beckman Optima TM L-100K ultracentrifuge (fixed angle). Notes:a.  It is helpful to label the outside of the tube where the pellet is likely to precipitate.b. The tube after the centrifugation has to be handled very carefully. Proceed to the next step immediately after the ultracentrifugation step to avoid disturbance of the pellet.20. After the centrifugation the supernatant is carefully removed using a pipette without disturbing the pellet but leaving approximatley 150-200 µl that was left enabbling the later resuspenssion of the pellet (Figure 1).Aspirate supernatant using pipetteLabelled outer side of the tube()Leave approximately 150-200 uL ofresidual buffer after aspiration. Transparent pellet (not visible)Figure  1.  Removing  supernatant  after  ultracentrifugation.  The supernatant  is removed using a pipette; approximately 150-300~ul covering the invisible pellet is left behind.21. The tube is incubated for 30-60 min at ^22^°C at 40 rpm, tilted with the labelled side down (Figure 2) in order to gently solubilise the pellet.# Residual buffer (150- 200 ul with the pellet)()Figure 2. Gentle resuspension of the pellet. The tube is placed as shown in the figure and gently agitated for 30-60 min .22. Following incubation, the often transparent retentate containing particles of interest is resuspended in residual buffer (usually approximately 150-200~ul) ) by pipetting up and down.23. The resuspended pellet is transferred to the 1.7ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 30 sec at 16,000~x~g . The pellet is discarded and supernatant is transferred to a new eppendorf tube with 0.02% sodium azide (final concentration) added. This preparation is used for visualizing Afp particles or its variants using transmission electron microscopy or for other applications.Note: Afp particles of approximately 70% purity can be purified using this method.B.   Negative staining and TEM of Afp and its variants1.  The grids are charged by using glow discharging following manufacturer’s instructions no longer than 15 min before applying a sample.2.  To visualise Afp and its variants, 3~ul of the re-suspended pellet is applied to a freshly glow-discharged plastic-coated 200-mesh grid.3.  The sample is allowed to settle for 60 sec.4.  Excess fluid is wicked off using Whatman #1 filter paper and then stained for 45 sec with a 0.7% filtered uranyl acetate (p H5.0) .Note: 0.5-1.0% can also be used.5.  The grid is left to air dry on a filter paper for 5-15min .6.  Grids are examined in a Morgagni 268D TEM at a nominal magnification of 70,000- 180,000 operated at 80 KeV following manufacturer’s instructions. The images are captured using a Megapixel III digital camera. Several examples of the Afp images are shown in Figure 3.()Figure 3.

For PLA, cells were grown to 60% confluence on 12-mm-diameter cover glasses (Matsunami) placed in a 24-well plate (Greiner bio-one). EGF (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in acetic acid (Wako) and stored at 4°C for up to 1 month.Patient specimensTumor specimens were obtained from 29 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (15 with an activating EGFR mutation, 14 WT for EGFR) who had undergone transbronchial lung biopsy between January 2007 and January 2016 at Kyushu University Hospital. EGFR mutations were identified by the peptide nucleic acid–locked nucleic acid PCR clamp method [10]. Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and treated as previously described [14]. The present study conforms to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics review board of Kyushu University.In situ PLA and microscopy analysisCells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. An in situ PLA for detection of EGFR homodimers was performed with Duolink II PLA probes, Probemaker, and detection reagents (Olink Bioscience). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies to EGFR (Abcam) were conjugated to PLUS or MINUS PLA oligonucleotide arms with the use of Probemaker. Cells grown on cover glasses or tumor sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the antibody-oligonucleotide complexes (PLA probes). Annealing of the PLUS and MINUS PLA probes occurs when two EGFR monomers are in close proximity, and repeat sequences in the annealed oligonucleotide complexes are amplified and then recognized by a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probe. PLA signals were detected with a Keyence BZ-8100 fluorescence microscope and were quantified with BZ Analyzer software (Keyence); 20 cells for each cell line and all cells in each image for tumor sections were examined for determination of the number of PLA signals per cell.Immunohistochemical stainingCells were incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to EGFR (Cell Signaling Technology), and immune complexes were detected with secondary antibodies, the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase system, and 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (Nichirei).Immunoblot analysisImmunoblot analysis was performed as previously described [14]. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human Tyr1068-phosphorylated EGFR, to EGFR, and to β-actin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.Plasmid transfectionA Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V was obtained from Lonza. Ba/F3 cells (2 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution containing 2 μg of an expression vector for human EGFR [15] and were then subjected to electroporation according to program X-001 with a Nucleofector II Device (Amaxa Biosystems).","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5641116.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Expression, Purification and Crystallization of Recombinant Arabidopsis Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase (MGD1)","text":"Expression, Purification and Crystallization of Recombinant Arabidopsis Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase (MGD1)\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 50 m l Corning tubes (Corning, catalog number: 430829)\n2. 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (Treff, catalog number: 96.07246.9.01)\n3. 30~mI centrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thermo Scientific TM, catalog number: 3138-\n0030)\n4. 0.2um PES-membrane filters (Dominique Dutscher, catalog number: 051732)\n5.

Expression of MGD1∆137-6His proteinThe protein construction here described is a truncated form of MGD1 (MGD1∆137-6His), deprived of its N-terminal 136 amino-acid residues and with a non-cleavable 6-histidine tag at the protein Cterminus. The deleted segment comprises the canonical N-terminal chloroplast signal peptide (res. 1-106; cleaved upon import to the organelle), and a 30-mer region predicted to be disordered, and not necessary for activity. The mgd1∆137 DNA fragment was cloned at the NdeI/NotI sites of the pET29b vector (Novagen, 69872), generating the pET29b-MGD1∆137-6His construct. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as host cells for protein production.1.  Prepare 1 L of sterile LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 u/ml) . Inoculate media with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pET29b-MGD1∆137-6His construct. Incubate culture at 37^°C and 180 rpm.2.  Monitor O D_600n m of culture on a UV/VIS spectrophotometer.3.  At O D_600n m0.6-0.8 , take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (before induction - T0). Centrifuge ( 13,000 x g_ 1 min), discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 40~ul of distilled water and 10ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.4.  Induce cells with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.25mM . Incubate 4h at 30^°C , 180 rpm.5.  After induction, take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (after induction - T4). Centrifuge (13,000× g,1m i n) , discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 80~ul of distilled water and 20ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.6.  Harvest cells by centrifugation ( 7,000× g for 20 min at 4^°C ).7.  Discard supernatant and store the pellet in a previously weighed 50ml Corning tube.8.  Weigh wet cell pellet and store at -20~^°C if not immediately used (typically 4/L culture).B.  IMAC purification of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Resuspend cell pellet in the lysis buffer (typically 5ml/g of cells). If cell resuspension is difficult, up to 10ml/ of cells of lysis buffer can be used.2.  Add Antifoam 204 (1-2 drops for 20ml ).3.  Disrupt cells on a Cell Disruption system at 1.5-1.8 kbar and incubate lysate for 20 min on ice. If lysate is too viscous upon disruption, add more Benzonase nuclease and/or increase incubation time on ice.4.  Spin lysate at 45,000xg for 30 min at 4^°C . Recover supernatant, dilute 2x in binding/washing buffer and further clarify it by filtration using a 0.2um filter.5.  Equilibrate the Histrap FF 1 ml (or 5m l for scale-up) with 5-10 CV (column volumes) of binding/washing buffer at 1 ml/min (2 ml/min on the 5 ml column).6.  Inject clarified lysate in the column at 1ml/min . Collect the column flow-through.7.  Wash column with the same buffer until Abs280nm is stable.8.  Wash column at 1ml/min overset2m/m i n on the 5ml column) with 5-10 CV of 8% elution buffer (40 mM imidazole) followed by 510CV of 16% ( 80m M imidazole) of the same solution.9.  Elute proteins at 1ml/min ( 2m l/m i n for the 5ml column) using a linear gradient from 16-100% of the same buffer 80-500~m M imidazole). Typically, gradient is performed for 10 min (15 min on the 5 ml column).10. Collect fractions (1 m) throughout all purification steps.11. Evaluate protein purity of MGD1∆137-6His containing fractions by SDS-PAGE analysis - take 16ul of sample and add 4ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.12. Evaluate protein homogeneity of MGD1∆137-6His containing fractions by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (see Note 7 for details).13. Pool appropriate fractions and concentrate up to 20m g/m l using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 Da concentrator (see Note 8 for details).14. Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDropTM 2000 spectrophotometer, using a sequence-derived extinction coefficient of 47,^900M^-1c m^-1 . Use 1:1 washing/elution buffer mix (imidazole)final 250m M as blank.C.  Size exclusion purification of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Equilibrate the Superdex S200 10/300 GL column with 2 CV (48 ml) of size exclusion buffer at 0.5–0.8m l/m i n (control that pressure does not exceed the maximum limit of 1.5M P a , otherwise decrease the flow).2.  Inject a maximum of 500ul of a 20m g/m l protein sample in the column.3.  Wash the column with the same buffer to elute proteins.4.  Collect 0.5ml fractions and perform SDS-PAGE and DLS analysis of the samples. For the SDSPAGE, take 16~ul of sample and add 4ul of 5× DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading. If samples are too viscous for gel loading, increase boiling and/or sonication times.5.  Wash the column with 2 CV of Mili-Q (MQ) water, followed by 2 CV of 20% ethanol.6.  Pool fractions containing pure and homogeneous MGD1∆137-6His protein.7.  Concentrate the protein to 10 m g/ m l using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 concentrator.8.  Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280~n m , using the size exclusion buffer as blank.9.  Prepare 40ul aliquots and store at -20~^°C , until further use.D.  Crystallization of MGD1∆137-6His protein1.  Prepare a protein stock solution at 6mg/ml (use the size exclusion buffer for dilution).2.  Prepare the precipitant solution containing 200mMM g C l_2.6H_2O and 22% (w/v) PEG 3350.3.  Pipet 400ul of precipitant solution into the reservoir(s) of the crystallization plate.4.  Prepare the crystallization drop(s) on the cover slip with 1 ul of MGD1  137-6His at 6m g/m l and 2ul of precipitant solution.5.  Place the cover slip over the well (drop facing reservoir) and seal.6.  Incubate plate at ^20^°C . Inspect the plate frequently, under a microscope (crystals appear in one week, but often grow bigger within 10-12 days). Avoid temperature changes and keep the plate at ^20^°C as much as possible.7.  Crystals cryoprotection is achieved in a two-step procedure (i) by transferring into a stabilizing solution of mother liquor (precipitant solution) containing 27% (w/v) PEG 3350 precipitant, (ii) followed by a quick soak in the same cryoprotective solution supplemented with 30% (W/v) of the same precipitant. Use the cryocrystallography material to mount and handle crystals.8.  Flash-cool and store crystals in LN2.# Notes1.  A more detailed explanation on the role of MGD1 in galactolipid biosynthesis is described in Rocha et al. (2013; 2016).2.  All solutions must be filtered prior to use. Solutions to be used in size exclusion chromatography have also to be degassed.3.  To accelerate cell growth, a pre-inoculum can be used. Prepare a small culture using the procedure described, and incubate overnight at 37~^°C , 180 rpm. Inoculate the new LB media with 2.3% of the overnight culture (typically 20-30~ml/L of media).4.  Length of column washing/equilibration steps can be adjusted (shortened or extended), by monitoring the stabilization of the absorbance at 280n m , as given by the AKTA FPLC system.5.  Because MGD1∆137-6His has a molecular weight of 45k D a , 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels can be used.6.  DTT can be used during the procedure, but for long-term storage TCEP is more stable and efficient.7.  DLS is an ideal technique for characterizing proteins in a variety of conditions and obtain information on their state in solution. It can be used to identify conditions that provide biologically relevant  oligomeric  structures,  ensure  monodispersity  and  optimal  stability,  minimize aggregation and ultimately, are ideal for crystallization. The default standard operation protocol (SOP) for protein size analysis of the Zetasizer Nano ZS^T M was used, with modifications to temperature ( y°0 or 20 ^°C_. ) and type of solvent used (e.g., water +~5% glycerol) to take into account the viscosity of the solution. Triplicate measurements are performed automatically. If the sample is monodisperse, only one population is seen (single peak), whereas polydispersity is represented by multiple populations (several peaks); also, the size distribution (peak width) around the protein diameter should be as narrow as possible; and finally the particle diameter should  be compatible with  the  protein  species  (very  large diameters  indicate  protein aggregation). A typical DLS experiment for MGD1, together with its expected results, can be found in Rocha et al. (2013), where the protein production optimized protocol was first published.8.  Throughout the purification, the appropriate fractions are determined according to their purity (SDS-PAGE) and homogeneity (DLS). MGD1∆137-6His fractions that are not very pure or not homogeneous are discarded from the pooling and not used in the following steps. Typically, fractions from the beginning and end of the eluted chromatographic peak are not included in the pooling.9.

Prior to experiments, worms were synchronized by hypochlorite isolation of eggs from gravid adults, followed by hatching of eggs in S Basal. Six thousand synchronized L1 larvae were transferred onto 10-cm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or NGM plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1 mM IPTG that were seeded with appropriate RNAi strains. After transfer, worms were grown at 20 °C for 50 h prior to use. Young adult worms were used for all assays unless otherwise noted.Bacterial strainsRNAi experiments in this study were done using RNAi-competent HT115 obtained from the Ahringer or Vidal RNAi library [82, 83]. All plasmids were sequence-verified prior to use.C. elegans chemical exposure assaysPrior to exposure to mitochondrial-damaging agents and/or antioxidants, synchronized young adult worms were washed from NGM plates seeded with OP50, and then resuspended in S Basal supplemented with one of the following: 50 μM antimycin A (Sigma), 50 μM rotenone (Sigma), 3 mM TTFA (Sigma), 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma), 20 μM CCCP (Sigma), 10% ethanol (Fisher), 1 mM phenanthroline (Sigma), 7 mM sodium selenite (Alfa Aesar), 1 mM H2O2 (Sigma), 60 μM tunicamycin (Thermo Fisher), 12.5 μM bortezomib (Thermo Fisher), 50 μM juglone (Sigma), 5 or 2.5 mM NAC (Acros Organics), 25 mM ascorbate (TCI), 5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical), and 10 μM mitoquinol (Cayman Chemical) in the presence of OP50. When specified, treatments were combined (e.g., rotenone/NAC, rotenone/NAC/ascorbate, etc.). Worms were imaged every 2 h for 20 h. Three biological replicates per experiment were performed, with ~ 400 worms per replicate.Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)Six thousand young adult worms were used for RNA purification and subsequent qRT-PCR (performed as previously described [84]). Prior to RNA extraction, worms were grown on RNAi bacteria from L1 stage to young adult stage. Primer sequences are available upon request. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates were used.Imaging and fluorescence quantificationFor visualization of the ALF86, CF1553, CL2166, GR2183, NVK90, NVK93, SJ4005, SJ4100, SLR115, WY703, and WY756 young adults exposed to mitochondrial-damaging agents in 96-well plates, Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) was used. All the imaging was performed with identical settings. GFP quantifications were performed by using Gen5 3.0 software and via flow vermimetry on COPAS FP (Union Biometrica). Approximately four hundred worms were used for Cytation 5 imaging and ~ 1000 worms were used for flow vermimetry per biological replicate, and three biological replicates were used for each experiment.ROS quantificationsSuperoxide was measured by using dihydroethidium (DHE) (Thermo Fisher) dye. Amplex Red assay was performed to measure hydrogen peroxide levels as described (Thermo Fisher). Worms were treated with mitochondrial-damaging agents for 10 h in 96-well plate before fluorescence measurement was taken. DHE was added at a final concentration of 3 μM and was let stained for 1 h in the dark. Worms were washed three times before reading to remove any remaining drugs or dye. Fluorescence intensities were recorded by using COPAS Biosort for DHE staining or Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) at 545/590 nm for Amplex Red. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates were used with ~ 400 worms per replicate.Cell cultureRWPE-1 cells were maintained in defined keratinocyte SF media (Sigma), supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher). 16HBE cells were maintained in minimum essential medium eagle (MEM) supplemented with 10% HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GE Healthcare) and 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher). All media were supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) at a final concentration of 1%. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Non-supplemented MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine was used for experiments. Cells were exposed to 20 μM CCCP or DMSO, alone or in combination with 0.5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical) or 2.5 μM MitoTEMPO (Cayman Chemical) in MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 16 h prior to RNA extraction and purification. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates of ~ 106 cells were used.Statistical analysisRStudio (version 3.6.3) was used to perform statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to calculate the significance of a treatment when there were three or more groups in the experimental setting. To follow, Dunnett’s test (R package DescTools, version 0.99.34) was performed to calculate statistical significance or p values between each group of the statistically significant experimental results. Student’s t test analysis was performed to calculate the p values when comparing two groups in an experimental setting.

Mutation and overexpressionSite directed mutagenesis by whole plasmid PCR was essentially carried out as described by Weiner et al. (1994).1.  The mutagenesis-PCR was setup as followed: 1.25ul wtClcF plasmid (6 kbp) (20n g/u l) 1.25ul forward Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) ) with the respective mutation site 1.25ul reverse Primer ( 100n g/ul or 10uM) with the respective mutation site5 µl dNTP-Mix (2.5 mM)5 µl Pfu-Ultra buffer1 µl Pfu-Ultra 2.5 U/µl35.25 µl WaterPCR-Program:()2.  At the end the reaction was supplemented with 1/10 volume of 10× DpnI buffer and 10 U DpnI were added. The reaction was incubated at 37^°C for 1 h .3.  Afterwards 1.25ul of this mixture was transformed in ultracompetent E.coli DH5α.4.  Sequence integrity has to be proved by sequencing.5.  For expression purposes the plasmid with the codon sequence of ClcF or its mutants was transformed in E.coli BL21 (DE3)-CP-RIL.6.   For large scale protein production an overnight culture was setup with a colony from the transformation plate. The culture was incubated at 37~^°C and 250 rpm for 16~h in LB medium.7.  Afterwards 1 L LB medium was inoculated with the overnight culture in a ratio of 1/100 and further incubated at 37^°C and 250 rpm.8.  If the culture reached an optical density (OD600 nm) of 0.6 (app. 2-2.5 h) the protein production was induced by adding 1 M IPTG stock solution to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was further incubated for 4h at 30^°C .9.  After 4h induction the cells were harvested at 4,500× g for 25 min at 4^°C .10. The resulting pellet was resuspended in app. ^20ml wash buffer and again pelleted at 4,500xg for 45 min at 4^°C .11. The resulting pellet was stored at -20~^°C until further usage.# B.  PurificationTo get protein of sufficient puritiy eq95~% (estimated from a SDS-gel) a three step strategy including a heat precipitation followed by a two step column chromatography was necessary.1.  The cell pellet from 1 liter culture volume was resuspended in ^25ml lysis buffer. A 2 M MgCl2 stock solution was added to a final concentration of 3m M and 0.5 U DNase were used to the digest DNA.2.  Cells were disrupted using a precooled French Press at 1,500 Psi. The cells were passed three times through the French Press to ensure complete lysis.3.  The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 50,000× g for 1 h .4.  The supernatant was heated up to 65~^°C for 10 min in a water bath and afterwards cooled down on ice.5.  The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000× g for 1~h~ .6.  The resulting supernatant (app. ^25~ml ) was applied on a Q -sepharose, preequilibrated with IEX-A buffer.7.  The protein was applied on the column and the ClcF containing flowthrough (app. 30~ml ) was collected.8.  Solid ammonium sulfate (AMS) was added to a final concentration of 1.6 M to the flowthrough of the previous step (app. 6 g).9.  The resulting solution was applied on a Phenyl-sepharose preequilibrated with HIC buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 0 M AMS over 20 column volumes by means of an Aekta chromatography system. ClcF containing fractions were identified by activity assay as described in the underlying paper (Roth et al., 2013).10. ClcF containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 250 times the protein volume of 25~m M Tris (p H7.5) at 4^°C . The dialysis buffer is changed once after 12h .11. Prior crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 10 m g/ m l (determined using the Bradford assay) with a VivaSpin concentrator with a MWCO of 30,000 k D a at 4,000 xg. . Aliquots of the protein were directly frozen at -80~^°C till further usage.# C.  Crystallization1.  Based on the recipes of the commercial or published screens (e.g. sparse matrix, grid screen), all necessary buffer solution were prepared as stock solutions at a concentration of 1 M at the relevant pH Jancarik and Kim, 1991; Brzozowski and Walton, 2001; Hampton Research (see Reference 5); Jena Bioscience (see Reference 6).2.  All salt solutions and precipitant solutions were prepared as stock solutions at the highest concentration possible and filtered if applicable. For ClcF, 1 M Bis-Tris solutions with a p H6.0 and 7.0 with a spacing of 0.2 pH units are produced (pH adjusted with NaOH/HCl). Furthermore a 2 M MgCl2-solution and a solution of 50 % (w/v) PEG 3350 are necessary. All solutions are prepared with double distilled water.3.  The conditions of the respective screens were generated by mixing the appropriate stock solutions, previously prepared, in an Eppendorf tube.4.  A screen was setup by a pipetting robot with a reservoir of 90ul in a Greiner Crystalquick96 well crystallization plate.5.  Drops were setup by pipetting 0.2~ul reservoir solution and 0.2~uI protein solution respectively together. No further mixing is required. The plates are stored afterwards at 19~^°C . The plates were then regularly examined (in the first week every day, afterwards weekly) for crystal formation. Crystals usually appears between one day and up to 3 months, but occasionally even longer periods might be necessary to obtain crystals. If a promising condition (crystals, microcrystals or crystalline precipitate) was identified a fine screen was setup in a hanging drop 24 well format usually by varying the pH around the initial condition in a range of pm~1.5~p H units and the precipitant concentration within an applicable range (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Typical scheme for a 2-dimensional 24 well grid screen, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time6.  The reservoir was prepared as described and drops were setup with a total drop volume of 2~ul by mixing 1~ul protein with 1~ul reservoir over a reservoir of 500~ul in a 24 well Linbro crystallization plate.7.  For orthorhombic crystals of ClcF the screen, with a constant concentration of 0.4~M M g C l_2 in all conditions, is shown in Figure 2.()Figure 2. Typical screen for orthorhombic ClcF crystals, varying pH and precipitant concentration at the same time. In all conditions is M g C l_2 in a final concentration of 0.4 M.8.  For a complex the protein was premixed with 10m M substrate (5-chloromuconolactone), dissolved in a concentration of 1 M in water at pH 7 (adjusted with NaHCO3). No elongated  incubation  period  is  required  prior  crystallization.  The  setup  of  the crystallization plate was carried out as described.()Figure 3. Promising crystalline material within protein precipitate as starting point for further fine screens (left) and typical single crystals of ClcF (right). Further pictures could be found on the Hampton Research website (see Reference 5).D.  Cryoprotection1.  A condition with good looking crystals was chosen and the reservoir solution was prepared with 2% elevated precipitant concentration supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol.2.  Subsequently small amounts, 0.1 to 0.2ul of the cryosolution was added to the drop and the drop solution slowly exchanged against the cryosolution.3.  In the case of the complex the cryosolution contained the precipitant in a final concentration of 25% plus the ligand in a concentration of 10m M . No additional ethylene glycol is required.4.  Finally the crystals were fished with a nylon loop and plunged into liquid nitrogen.# Recipes1.

Male mice were used for all experiments. All mice were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and fed ad lib. Mice for the ChIP and RNA-seq experiments were housed at the Babraham Institute Biological Service Unit. All experimental protocols at Babraham Institute were approved by the Babraham Research Campus local ethical review committee and the Home Office (PPL 80/2488 and 70/8994). The antibiotics treatment experiments were performed at the University of Campinas. Male C57BL/6 mice at age 8–12 weeks were provided by the Multidisciplinary Centre for Biological Investigation (CEIMB) and all the experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use of the Institute of Biology, University of Campinas (protocol number 3742-1). No sample size calculation was used as the minimum number of mice used was 3 or 4. Mice of the same age and breed were randomly put in the experimental groups. The order of samples from groups was mixed on collection. Sample size is reported in exact numbers and no samples are excluded from the analysis. No blinding was conducted.Antibiotic treatment of miceMice received 200 µl of a mixture of antibiotics (5 mg/ml of neomicin, 5 mg/ml of gentamicin, 5 mg/ml of ampicillin, 5 mg/ml of metronidazole, and 2.5 mg/ml of vancomycin, Sigma Aldrich) daily for 3 days by gavage. The weight of the animals was monitored throughout the experiment. At the end of treatment period, feces were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After that, the animals were anesthetized using a mix of ketamine and xylazine (300 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) and the blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The blood was maintained at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and then centrifuged (3000×g, 8 min). The serum was collected and frozen at −80 °C. After euthanizing the animals by cervical dislocation, the entire intestine was harvested and the small intestine, colon, and cecum were isolated.Determination of fecal bacterial loadStool samples were collected on the third day after treatment by gavage with a mix of antibiotics or placebo. Fifty milligrams of the samples were used for extraction of the microbial genomic DNA using the InvitrogenTM PureLinkTM Microbiome DNA Purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Bacterial DNA was quantified by real-time PCR using primers complementary to 16S rDNA of Eubacteria (sense ACT CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AGT; anti-sense ATT ACC GCG GCT GCT GGC)40. To determine the fecal bacterial load, a standard curve with serial dilutions was employed using genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli grown in vitro. Results obtained were normalized by the control condition (untreated mice).SCFA measurementsColonic luminal content samples were weighed into 1.5 ml tubes, crushed and homogenized in 100 µl of distilled water. Subsequently, 40 mg of sodium chloride, 20 mg of citric acid, 40 µl of 1 M hydrochloric acid, and 200 µl of butanol were added. The tubes were vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 18,000×g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to microtubes, and 1 µl was injected into the gas chromatograph. For serum measurements, 20 mg of sodium chloride, 10 mg of citric acid, 20 µl of 1 M hydrochloric acid, and 100 µl of butanol were added to 100 µl of serum samples. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged as previously described and 1 µl was injected into the gas chromatograph. To quantify SCFAs, a calibration curve for the concentration range of 0.015–1 mg/ml was constructed. SCFAs measurements were performed following a recently published protocol41: chromatographic analyses were performed using an Agilent 6850 system with ExChrom software, equipped with a 7683B automatic liquid sampler, a flame ionization detector (FID) (Agilent Technologies, USA), and a fused-silica capillary RTX-WAX (Restec Corporation, U.S.) with dimensions of 60 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter (i.d.) coated with a 0.15-µm thick layer of polyethylene glycol. The initial oven temperature was 100 °C (hold 2 min), which was increased to 200 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min (hold 5 min). The FID temperature was maintained at 260 °C, and the flow rates of H2, air, and the make-up gas N2 were 35, 350, and 25 ml/min, respectively. Sample volumes of 1 µl were injected at 260 °C using a split ratio of approximately 25:1. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at 25 ml/min. The runtime for each analysis was 12.95 min.Small intestinal and colon epithelium extractionAnimals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation or exposure to CO2. Dissected small intestines and colons were opened longitudinally and washed three times with ice cold Hank's balanced salt solution without Ca2+/Mg2+ (HBSS). Intestinal and colon epithelium were dissociated with 30 mM EDTA/HBSS on ice with shaking for 30 min for small intestine and 1 h for colon; 50 ml Falcon tubes containing the tissue were then shaken vigorously by hand (2–3 shakes/second) for 5 min. The colon epithelium was incubated for an additional 10 min on ice in 30 mM EDTA/HBSS and further shaken for 5 min. Mucus and sub-mucosa were removed by dripping the material through a 100 μm followed by a 70 μm cell strainer. The extracted cells were pelleted at 475×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed with ice cold HBSS and re-pelleted as above for further use. For the H3K18cr ChIP, three colons were combined.Purification and enzymatic digestion of histonesFor isolating a crypt-enriched fraction, villi were removed by shaking the small intestine pieces for 10 s after incubation for 5 min on ice in HBSS–30 mM EDTA and before the additional incubation in HBSS–30 mM EDTA for 15 min. Histones were then acid extracted following a protocol published in ref. 42: one small intestine/colon was used per extraction followed by MS analysis. Small intestine epithelium, colon epithelium, and a crypt-enriched fraction were homogenized in lysis buffer (10% sucrose; 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0; 15 mM NaCl; 60 mM KCl; 15 mM HEPES; 0.5% Triton; 0.5 mM PMSF; 1 mM DTT; 5 mM NaF; 5 mM Na3VO4; 5 mM Na-butyrate, cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Nuclei were separated from the cytoplasm by centrifugation on sucrose cushions, washed in cold PBS, and then extracted in 0.4 N HCl overnight (o.n.) at 4 °C. Core histones, together with linker histones protein, were dialyzed against 100 mM ice-cold acetic acid. The concentration of purified samples was measured using the Bradford protein assay. Approximately 10 µg were separated on SDS-PAGE and bands corresponding to the histones H3 were excised and in-gel digested43. Briefly, gel bands were cut in pieces and destained with repeated washes in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in H2O, alternated with dehydration steps in 100% ACN. Gel pieces were then in-gel chemically alkylated by incubation with D6-acetic anhydride (Sigma 175641) in 1 M NH4HCO3 and CH3COONa solution as catalyzer. After 3 h at 37 °C with high shaking in a thermomixer, chemically modified gel slices were washed with NH4HCO3, alternated with ACN at increasing percent (from 50 to 100%). In-gel digestion was performed with 100 ng/µl trypsin (Promega V5113) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 at 37 °C overnight. Chemical acetylation occurs on unmodified and monomethylated lysines and prevents trypsin digestion at these residues, thus producing a pattern of digestion similar to that obtained with the Arg-C protease (the so-called “Arg-C like” in-gel digestion pattern). The resulting histone peptides display an optimal length for MS detection and enhanced hydrophobicity that increases their separation at ultra-pressure chromatographic regimes.Finally, digested peptides were collected and extracted using 5% formic acid alternated with ACN 100%. Digested peptides were desalted and concentrated using a combination of reverse-phase C18/C “sandwich” system and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography on hand-made micro-columns (StageTips44, 45). Eluted peptides were lyophilized, suspended in 1% TFA in H2O, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS.LC-MS/MSThe peptide mixtures were analyzed by online nano-flow LC-MS/MS using an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientic) connected to a QExactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through a nano-electrospray ion source. The nano-LC system was operated in one column setup with a 25-cm analytical column (75 µm inner diameter, 350 µm outer diameter) packed with C18 resin (ReproSil, Pur C18AQ 1.9 m, Dr. Maisch, Germany) configuration. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid (FA) in ddH2O and solvent B was 80% ACN with 0.1% FA. Samples were injected in an aqueous 1% TFA solution at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. Peptides were separated with a gradient of 0–40% solvent B for 100 min, followed by a gradient of 40–60% in 5 min, and 60–95% over 5 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The Q-Exactive instrument was operated in the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300–1150) were analyzed in the Orbitrap detector with resolution R = 60,000 at m/z 200. The 10 most intense peptides were sequentially isolated to a target value of 3 × 106 and fragmented by high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy setting of 27%. The maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 20 ms for full scans and 50 ms for MS/MS and the target value for MS/MS was set to 1 × 106. Standard mass spectrometric conditions for all experiments were as follows: spray voltage, 2.4 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow.MS data analysis and relative abundance profilingAcquired RAW data were analyzed by MaxQuant(MQ) software v1.5.2.8, using the Andromeda search engine46. Uniprot Mouse database (70,902 entries) was used for peptide identification. Enzyme specificity was set to Arg-C. Estimated false discovery rate of all peptide identifications was set at a maximum of 1% (Decoy database-based approach). Mass tolerance for searches was set to a maximum of 6 parts per million (ppm) for peptide masses and 20 ppm for HCD fragment ion masses. A maximum of three missed cleavages was allowed. In the search, we focused on lysine methylation and acylation, including as variable modifications: D3-acetylation (+45.0294 Da), D3-acetylation (+45.0294 Da) plus monomethylation (+14.016 Da), dimethylation (+28.031 Da), trimethylation (+42.046 Da), acetylation (+42.010 Da), and crotonylation (+68.074 Da). The use of high-accuracy criteria for HCD fragment ions tolerance (20 ppm) guarantee the capability to discriminate among other possible forms of acylation (e.g., lysine butyrylation (70.0418 Da) and β-hydroxybutyrylation (86.0367 Da)), therefore they were not included in the search. MaxQuant search results were exported and peptides with Andromeda score <60 and localization probability score <0.75 were removed. Filtered data were subjected to manual inspection and validation using the viewer.exe module integrated in MQ software47. Extracted ion chromatograms were constructed for each precursor based on the m/z value, using a mass tolerance of 10 ppm with a mass precision up to four decimals. For each histone-modified peptide, the relative abundance percentage (RA%) was estimated by dividing the area under the curve (AUC) of each modified peptide over the sum of the areas corresponding to all observed isoforms of that peptide, including the unmodified forms48. Significant changes among crypt and colon versus small intestine fraction have been calculated with a two-way ANOVA test using the Perseus software49. p-Value < 0.01 (1% FDR) were considered as significant.Antibodies and western blot analysisAnti-lysine crotonyl antibody (PTM-501, 1:5000), anti-crotonyl-histone H3 lys18 (anti-H3K18cr, PTM-517, 1:5000), and anti-butyryl-histone H3 lys18 (anti-H3K18bt, PTM-306, 1:5000) were from PTM BIOLABS; anti-tri-methyl H3 lys4 antibody was from Active Motif (anti-H3K4me3, Cat.39159); anti-crotonyl-histone H4 lys8 antibody (anti-H4K8cr, ab201075), anti-acetyl-histone H3 lys18 (anti-H3K18ac, ab1191, 1:10000), anti-histone H4 (ab31827, 1:40000) anti-histone H3 (ab1791, 1:40000), and anti-LaminB1 (ab16048, 1:5000) were from Abcam; mouse monoclonal anti-HDAC1 (Clone 2E10, 1:5000) from Millipore, monoclonal anti-HDAC2 (C-8) (sc9959, 1:5000) from SantaCruz, and mouse polyclonal HDAC3 (BD61124, 1:5000) from BD biosciences.Western blots were washed with tris-borate-sodium-0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL); uncropped western blots are shown in Supplementary Figures 12–14.Cryosections and immunofluorescence stainingCryosections were prepared from adult murine tissue, fixed for 90 min at RT with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After 2 × 5 min washes with 1× PBS, samples were incubated in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C and embedded in Cryomatrix (ThermoFisher 6769006). Frozen blocks were cut with the Leica CM1860 cryotome to 8 μm sections and attached to Superfrost Plus slides (ThermoFisher 4951PLUS4). Before staining, sections were brought to RT, dried for 3 min at 60 °C, permeabilized for 20 min at RT in 1% Triton-X-100/PBS, and unmasked for 30 min at 95 °C in a citrate based-unmasking buffer (VECTOR H3300) followed by 3 × 5 min washes in PBS. Slides were blocked for 1 h in 5% FBS/PBS (FBS: fetal bovine serum) at RT followed by primary antibody (pan-crotonyl PTM Biolabs Inc. #PTM501, 1 µg/ml final conc.) incubation in blocking solution for 1 h at RT. After 4 × 5 min washes in 1× PBS, secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488 Invitrogen A11008, 1 µg/ml final conc.) was applied for 1 h at RT in blocking solution supplemented with DAPI. After 4 × 5 min washes in 1× PBS, samples were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 and sealed. Controls without the primary antibody were processed accordingly. Imaging was performed with the Zeiss780 confocal microscope using 20× air and 63× oil immersion objectives at optimal resolution settings. Z-stacks of whole sections were imaged and further processed to maximum projections with ImageJ software. For optimal print results background correction and contrast enhancement with up to 3% pixel saturation were performed with ImageJ.Cell culture and cell cycle analysisHuman colon carcinoma cells (HCT116) were a gift from Simon Cook's lab (Babraham Institute) who obtained them from Bert Vogelstein, John Hopkins University, Baltimore. This cell line is not in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines (ICLAC). They were grown in DMEM media containing glucose and pyruvate, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. For the cell cycle analysis, HCT116 cells were blocked at G1 with 15 nM of abemaciclib (LY2835219, Seleck Chemicals) for 48 h and released by washing 2× with PBS and adding fresh medium. Class I HDAC inhibition was with 5 μM MS275 for 48 h. Cells were washed 2× with PBS and fresh medium supplemented with 1 μM MS275 was added. Cells were harvested at indicated intervals after release and one half was analyzed by western blotting. The remainder were used to determine cell cycle profiles with propidium iodide staining using the BD Pharmingen PI/RNAse staining buffer on LSRII Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and Cell Cycle tool on FlowJo 10.0.8. HDAC1 over-expression was performed by transfecting HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine® 2000 Transfection Reagent following manufacturer's protocol using 50 μL of reagent and 12 μg of p181 pK7-HDAC1 (GFP) plasmid DNA (gift from Ramesh Shivdasani, Addgene plasmid # 1105450) or an N-terminal deletion mutant in a 60-mm dish for 16 h.Whole cell extract preparationsFor whole cell extract preparation, cells were detached with trypsin, washed in PBS, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (Biorad) for 5 min. The extracts were briefly sonicated to remove high molecular weight DNA before loading on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis.Intestinal organoid seeding and culturesSmall intestinal crypts were derived from wildtype C57BL/6 mice using a slightly modified protocol from reference51. In brief, collected small intestines were opened longitudinally and the majority of villi removed by gentle scraping with a coverslip. The tissue was cut to 3–5 mm pieces, washed five times with cold PBS, and vigorous shaking. After 30 min incubation on ice with 2 mM EDTA/ PBS, the remaining villi were removed with short shaking and tissue pieces were incubated for additional 30 min in 5 mM EDTA/PBS on ice. After another short shake, crypts were passed through a 40-μm cell strainer and pelleted at 425×g 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was washed with cold PBS and 100–200 crypts were suspended in 50 μl Red-phenol-free Matrigel (BD Biosciences) droplets. After polymerization, complete medium containing advanced DMEM/F12 (Sigma), 2 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1 mM N-acetyl-cysteine (Sigma), 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1× N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 50 ng/ml mouse EGF (Peprotech), 100 ng/ml mouse Noggin (Peprotech), and 10% human R-spondin-1-conditioned medium from R-spondin-1-transfected HEK293T cells (Cultrex) was added to the cultures. Medium was changed every 3 days and organoids passaged after 7–10 days.ChIP-seq of extracted colon epitheliumThe colon epithelium cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of PBS-1% formaldehyde and fixation was carried out for 10 min, at RT with gentle agitation. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine (0.125 M final concentration) and the cells were pelleted at 475×g at 4 °C for 10 min, washed once with PBS, re-pelleted and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C or processed further immediately. The cell pellet was resuspended and incubated for 10 min in 500 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA 1% SDS (ChIP lysis buffer) on ice. Sonication of the chromatin to 100–500 bp fragment size range in polystyrene tubes was performed with a water-cooled Bioruptor (Diagenode), high power, 4 °C, 12 cycles, 30 s on, 30 s off. The sonicated material was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, incubated for 30–45 min on ice, and pelleted at 20,800×g for 10 min, 4 °C to precipitate SDS. We pooled three colons to perform three ChIP experiments, using 20–25 μg equivalent of DNA for each experiment. For immunoprecipitation, the chromatin was diluted 1:10 with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl, 1.1% Triton-X-100), 5 μg anti-H3K18cr antibody (PTM-517) or H3K4me3 antibody (Active Motif Cat.39159) per 20 μg DNA was added and this was incubated overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. One percent input chromatin was collected and kept on ice. Immunoprecipitation of chromatin complexes was with Protein A-coated Dynabeads (Novex, Cat.10001D); 20–30 μl of bead suspension were washed two times with ChIP dilution buffer and the antibody–chromatin mix was added to the beads. Immunoprecipitation was for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Following this incubation, tubes were spun briefly and bound material was separated from unbound using a magnetic stand on ice.All washes were performed at 4 °C for 5 min on a rotating wheel using 20× volumes with respect to the beads volume used. Beads were washed 1× with low-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1 % SDS), 2× with high-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1 % SDS), and 1× with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (1× TE). Elution of DNA from beads was with 200 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer at 1000 rpm. Supernatant was separated using a magnetic stand and transferred to a fresh tube. After bringing all inputs to 200 μl with elution buffer, both chromatin and input samples were reverse cross-linked by adding 8 μl of 5 M NaCl followed by an incubation at 65 °C overnight at 300 rpm in a thermomixer. Proteinase K Solution (Ambion, Cat:AM2548) was added to samples to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and incubated for 2 h at 65 °C, 300 rpm. Chipped DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Cat.28104) and quantified using QubitTM 3.0 fluorimeter. Library preparation was performed from 5 ng of purified DNA using the NEBNext® UltraTM II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® with the following modifications: Illumina Tru-Seq adaptors were used and library amplification was performed with the KAPA PCR Amplification kit (KAPA, Cat. KK2501) using 11 cycles. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) according to manufacturer's instructions.ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR of HCT116 cell extractsHCT116 cells were treated with either 5 µM MS275 or DMSO for 18 h. Cells were trypsinized and fixed as indicated in the ChIP-seq section above. Fixed cells were re-suspended in Sonication buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 1% SDS complemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma)) and sonicated as described above for 15 cycles. After centrifugation at 14,000×g for 10 min, supernatant was diluted 10× in ChIP dilution buffer; 1% input chromatin was collected and kept on ice and 30 µg equivalent of DNA per sample was incubated overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C with 5 µg of anti-H3K18cr antibody (PTM-517, PTM Biolabs) or 0.3 µg of anti-H3K18ac antibody (ab1191, Abcam). Twenty microliters of Magnetic ProtA/G Beads (Millipore) were added to the samples and incubated on a rotating wheel for 3 h at 4 °C. Antibody-bound beads were washed as described above. Chip DNA was eluted at 65 °C for 30 min in 200 µl of elution buffer. De-crosslinking and DNA elution of both ChIP and input samples was performed as described in the ChIP-seq section. Real time qPCR analysis was carried out on input and ChIP DNA samples using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on a BioRad CFX96 qPCR system. Each experiment has been carried out two times (biological replicates) and each sample has been run in triplicate (technical replicate). One percent of starting chromatin was used as input and data were analyzed accordingly. Primers were used at a final concentration of 250 nM with 62 °C as annealing/extension temperature and are listed in Table 2.Table 2Primers used in ChIP-qPCRNameFeatureForward (5′→3′)Reverse (5′→3′)up PUMAIntergenicGTTGCCAGTTACCACACCCTCCCAACTGTCCTTGCTGCTAADAD1TSS of not expressed geneGCTTCAGGACGTGTGAGGTATACCTGCGTGAGGGTTGTTTCLDN7TSS of expressed geneACTCTAAGGGAGGGGAACGATCCACTGGGACCTAAAGCCGp21TSS of expressed geneAGCAGGCTGTGGCTCTGATTCAAAATAGCCACCAGCCTCTTCTPUMATSS of expressed geneGTGTGTGTGTCCGACTGTCCCGAAGGAGGACCCAGGCGCTGTChr1 SATRepetitive regionTCATTCCCACAAACTGCGTTGTCCAACGAAGGCCACAAGAChr4 SATRepetitive regionCTGCACTACCTGAAGAGGACGATGGTTCAACACTCTTACASAT1Repetitive regionGAACCTGTGTTGCTGCTTTGTTCAAAGGTACTCTGCTTGGTACASAT2Repetitive regionTGAATGGAATCGTCATCGAACCATTCGATAATTCCGCTTGNBL2Repetitive regionTCCCACAGCAGTTGGTGTTATTGGCAGAAACCTCTTTGCTRNA-seqRNA was extracted from both HCT116 cells (four biological replicates) and mouse colon epithelium (three mice as biological replicates) using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was quantified with Nanodrop and the quality assessed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library preparation was performed from 500 ng of RNA using the NEB Next® UltraTM Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® and the NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module. Illumina Tru-Seq adaptors were used and library amplification was performed with the KAPA PCR Amplification kit (KAPA, Cat. KK2501) using 14 cycles. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Bioinformatic analysisRNA-seq: Sequencing reads were adaptor trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.4.2) and mapped to the mouse (GRCm38/mm10) reference genome with HiSat2 (version 2.0.5). Analysis of RNA-seq data was performed with SEQMONK version 1.36.0 on filtered reads with a MAPQ score of >60 for uniquely mapped reads. Read counts were quantified using the RNA-seq quantitation pipeline implemented in Seqmonk, quantifying only probes with at least one read. Probe read values were corrected for transcript length and divided into percentile bins according to their average expression levels of three replicates.ChIP-seq analysis: For mouse colon and HCT116 H3K18cr, two replicates and for H3K4me3 three biological replicates were used. Sequencing reads were adaptor trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.3.8 and 0.4.2) and mapped to the mouse (GRCm38/mm10) or human (GRCh38) reference genomes with Bowtie2 (version 2.0.4.). Analysis of ChIP-seq data was performed with SEQMONK version 1.36.0 on filtered reads with a MAPQ score of >42, duplicate reads were always removed. For Fig. 2b, the genome was segmented in 1000 bp non-overlapping 'probes' and read counts were quantified for each probe and normalized to the largest datastore. For Fig. 2c, H3K4me3 peaks were identified using the MACS peak finder embedded in the SEQMONK program with the ChIP-seq data of H3K4me3 from colon epithelial cells and INPUT as reference. Selected fragment size was 300 bp and p-value significance threshold was 10−5. Reads were quantitated in and ±5 kbp around the MACS peaks. For Fig. 2d, read counts were quantified over the TSS (using a window of ±1 kb upstream of genes) and probes that had more than 100 reads in input were removed in both input and ChIP. For Fig. 2e, read counts were quantified over the TSS (using a window of ±0.5 kb upstream of transcripts) and were overlapped with RNA-seq data. KEGG pathway analysis was with DAVID 6.8 with electronic annotations excluded.ChIP-qPCR data analysisPrior to analysis, a logarithmic transformation of the data was carried out. Subsequently, we carried out a two-way ANOVA test followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test. Data were analyzed using the Graphpad Prism Software.In vitro enzymatic assays of histone decrotonylation and deacetylationRecombinant human histone H3.1 (NEB) was acetylated or crotonylated in vitro using the recombinant catalytic domain of p300 (human, ENZO) in presence of acetyl-CoA or crotonyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. The reaction was carried out with 5.65 μM histone H3.1 and 0.66 μM P300 catalytic domain in 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01 % Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 87 μM crotonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 65 °C for 5 min and the histones were diluted with two volumes of HDAC buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 μM ZnSO4) for either decrotonylation or deacetylation reactions. Decrotonylation/deacetylation was typically performed with 1.75 μM modified histones and 0.12 μM HDAC1 (recombinant, human, Active Motif) or 0.18 μM HDAC2 (recombinant, human, ABCAM) at 30 °C for 2 h. Recombinant HDAC3/Ncor1 complex was from ENZO Life Sciences. All HDACs were produced in insect cells and purified. After the reaction, the histone modifications were identified by western blot. The pixel intensities of the western blot bands were quantified with the Image J software.For the enzyme kinetic analysis, histone H3 was acetylated or crotonylated in vitro as described above. Dot blot western analysis with synthetic H3 peptides that were specifically crotonylated or acetylated at K18 indicated full crotonylation and acetylation of the histone H3 at K18 under these conditions, therefore, we assume that the histone had been fully crotonylated or acetylated. Different dilutions of modified histones were prepared in HDAC buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 μM ZnSO4) for either decrotonylation or deacetylation reactions. Decrotonylation/deacetylation was performed with 1.41 to 0.19 μM modified histone H3 and 0.03 μM HDAC1 (recombinant, human, Active Motif) at 30 °C and stopped at 95 °C for 1 min. Five different modified histone concentrations and five different time points were performed in triplicate for the decrotonylation and deacetylation reactions.Each reaction was spotted in quadruplicate and left to dry before being rinsed with transfer buffer and TBS-T. Western blot was performed using anti-H3K18ac and anti-H3K18cr antibodies. Spots were quantified using image J and spot intensity was converted to substrate concentration by multiplying each relative value by the concentration of modified histone in the reaction mix. Substrate concentration against time were plotted for each histone concentration and a linear regression was fitted for the first 30 s to 1 min of the reaction, as appropriate. The rate of each reaction set was plotted as replicates against substrate concentration. GraphPad Prism Version 7 software was used to calculate Km, Vmax, and Kcat.Colorimetric deacetylation assaySynthesis of BOC-Lys(acetyl)-AMC and BOC-Lys(crotonyl)-AMC and the colorimetric assay was essentially as in ref. 2 with some modifications: for the synthesis of crotonyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide (149 mg, 6 equivalents, eq) was dissolved in 2.5 ml anhydrous dichloromethane to which diisopropylethylamine (167 mg, 6 eq) was added. The solution was cooled in an ice bath and trans-crotonoyl chloride (135 mg, 6 eq) was added and the reaction stirred at 20 °C for 3 h. Ethyl acetate (5 ml) was added and the solution washed with 5 ml brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The crude product was dissolved in 3 ml dry ACN and the appropriate amount used in the next step. Acetyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide was prepared in the same way but using acetyl chloride rather than crotonoyl chloride. For the synthesis of BOC-Lys (crotonyl)-AMC, Boc-Lys-AMC acetate salt (100 mg, 1 eq) purchased from Bachem AG was dissolved in 4 ml water:ACN (1:1). Sodium bicarbonate (19.95 mg, 1.1 eq) was added in 1 ml water followed by trans-crotonyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (2 eq) in 2 ml ACN. The reaction was left for 18 h and then concentrated to remove the ACN. The product was extracted into ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The product was purified on silica in dichloromethane:methanol (15:1). BOC-Lys(acetyl)-AMC was prepared in the same way but using acetyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide rather than crotonyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide.The enzymatic reaction was set up in a 96-well plate in triplicate in a 51-μl volume with 0.035 μM HDAC1 and 0.2 mM BOC-Lys(acetyl)-AMC/BOC-Lys(crotonyl)-AMC in HDAC buffer (see above) at 30 °C for 2 h. After this, 5 μl of a 1 mg/ml trypsin solution in 1 mM HCl was added and the mixture was incubated 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was read with a Pherastar plate reader at 360 nm excitation/450 nm emission.Data availabilityNext-generation sequencing data have been submitted to GEO under accession code GSE96035.

In the procedure, the MTSL probe is attached via a disulfide bond to a protein containing a single cysteine residue. NMR spectra are then acquired and interpreted to extract distance restraints. In order to interpret the NMR spectra, the backbone chemical shifts of the protein must first be obtained.()Figure 1. A flow chart of nitroxide labeling and representative PRE data. A. A flow chartdescribing the steps taken when site-specifically labeling proteins with nitroxide spin labels for PRE-derived structural studies. B. Representative ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum of IsdHN2N3 (see Sjodt et al., 2016 for more information). Boxed regions indicate the representative sections of each PRE probe’s spectra shown in (C) (K499R1 and E559R1). C. Magnified regions showing the selective distance dependent line-broadening for the K499R1 (top) and E559R1 (bottom) probes. For each probe the diamagnetic and paramagnetic spectra are shown on the left and right panels, respectively. D. Representative PRE profile of the E559R1 probe data. Normalized intensity ratios (Iox/Ired) are shown as a function of residue number. The asterisk depicts the location of the probe. Errors of the ratio measurements are approximately 10-15% based on signal to noise of the NMR spectra, which can lead to values in excess of 1. Errors also can occur as a result of manipulating the sample (adding ascorbate to reduce the probe) and instrument instability. These errors are partially accounted for by adding pm5AA to the distance restraints that are obtained from the ratio data (Battiste and Wagner, 2000).A.  Assign the backbone chemical shifts of the native protein1.  Acquire a high quality 2D ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum of the native protein to be used as a reference (i.e., a spectrum containing the appropriate number of resolved cross-peaks based on the amino acid sequence of the protein).2.  Assign the backbone amide chemical shifts in the native protein using standard NMR procedures (for standard NMR experiments see Cavanagh et al., 1995).B.  Generate a protein mutant with a single cysteine residue1.  For these studies, the protein should contain a single cysteine residue. Check the protein’s primary sequence to determine if it contains native cysteine residues that could be inadvertently labeled by the nitroxide probe. If necessary, make conservative mutations to these cysteine residues to prevent non-specific labeling. If biochemical assays are available for the protein, they should be performed to ensure these mutations do not impair its function.2.  Choose the desired location in the protein to which the nitroxide probe will be attached. This location needs to be at a residue whose sidechain is solvent-exposed. The residue should be located in a structured loop or within defined secondary structure. This is important because if the probe is located in a structurally disordered region of the protein, the increased flexibility of the polypeptide backbone can reduce the quantitative strength of the technique.3.  Perform site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a single cysteine residue at the desired location to which the nitroxide probe will be attached.4.  Purify ^15N -labeled protein containing the cysteine mutation. Use buffers that are supplemented with 2.5mM DTT to prevent formation of inter-molecular disulfide bonds that can lead to protein aggregation (see Note 1). For a review on expression and purification of proteins see Gräslund et al. (2008).5.  Prior to labeling the purified cysteine mutant with MTSL, verify that the cysteine mutation does not affect the structure of the protein. This can be accomplished by comparing the ^1H-^15N- HSQC spectra of the mutant and native proteins. The chemical shift position of the cross-peaks in the spectra should be similar, with only localized changes occurring near the site of the mutation.C.  Site-specific labeling the proteinThe aim of the following steps is to label the ^1H_-^15N labeled purified cysteine mutant of the protein with MTSL. Care is taken to maintain the cysteine mutant under reducing conditions until it is modified with MTSL. The apparatus used to label the protein is shown in Figure 2, and consists of a conical tube and desalting column.()Figure 2. Schematic of the apparatus used to label proteins with MTSL1.  Buffer  exchange  the ^15N -labeled  cysteine  mutant  into  labeling  buffer  that  has  been supplemented with fresh 2.5m M DTT. The protein concentration should be at least 250-300uM .2.  Make a stock solution of MTSL by adding acetonitrile directly to the amber vial in which the MTSL was shipped. The final concentration of the stock solution should be 200m M MTSL. Store the MTSL stock solution at -20~^°C (see Notes 2 and 3).3.  Immediately before starting the labeling reaction, dilute the protein with labeling buffer to a final concentration of 250-300~uM protein. The final volume of the diluted protein solution should be 1 ml. The protein should be diluted with labeling buffer that does not contain DTT. From this step forward, all buffers used in this procedure should not contain DTT.4.  Equilibrate a Zeba spin desalting column with labeling buffer as per the manufacturer’sinstructions.5.  Construct the MTSL solution that will be used to label the protein. Pipette 2.5~m of labeling buffer into a clean 15m conical tube. Add MTSL from the stock solution to the conical tube. The amount added should be sufficient to achieve a final concentration of MTSL that is 10× the molar amount of protein that will be labeled (e.g., if the final concentration of protein in the reaction will be 300~uM then the concentration of MTSL should be 3m M ). Make sure to shield all MTSL solutions from light by covering the tube with foil first.6.  Construct the apparatus that will be used to label the protein (Figure 2). Place the equilibrateddesalting column into the conical tube from step C5. The column will rest above the MTSLcontaining solution and will leave room for the protein solution to flow through.# bio-protocol7.  Slowly pipette the protein onto the center of the column’s resin bed (Figure 2).8.  Centrifuge as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein will flow through the column and into the labeling solution, while DTT present in the protein solution will remain on the column. The process is considered complete after the elution of all the protein solution into the MTSL solution at the bottom of the collection tube. This will produce a solution located at the bottom of the conical tube that has a total volume of 3.5ml . Discard the desalting column.9.  Cover the conical tube containing the modification reaction with foil and let it incubate under agitation for 15m i n at room temperature.10. After 15 m i n , add additional MTSL from the stock solution to the modification reaction. The amount of added MTSL should yield a final concentration that is 20× greater than the protein’s concentration in the conical tube.11. Place tube back onto a rotating device and let the protein:MTSL mixture incubate under agitation overnight at room temperature (neginspace6h) .12. Buffer exchange the MTSL-labeled protein sample into the desired NMR buffer using a fresh Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter. This will remove any excess (unligated) MTSL (see Notes 4-6). As mentioned above, the NMR buffer should not contain any DTT.13. Verify that the protein is labeled with MTSL by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As compared to the unligated protein, the mass of the modified protein should increase by 186 Da (the weight of the attached probe). Although MALDI-TOF is not quantitative, in the mass spectrum >90% of the protein should be labeled with MTSL. If biochemical assays are available for the protein, they should be performed on labeled protein to verify that MTSL attachment does not impair its function.14. For NMR studies, the MTSL modified protein should have a final concentration of 300uM (see Note 7). The NMR buffer should contain 8–10% D2O, but be devoid of any DTT. Place the sample in a standard NMR tube and shield from light using foil.# D.  NMR data acquisition1.  Use a standard 2D- ^1H-^15N -HSQC pulse sequence to acquire a spectrum of the freshly MTSLlabeled protein. Typically, the ^1H and ^15N dimensions are defined by 2,048 and 256 complex points, respectively. At this time, the sample is in its paramagnetic state. Its spectrum should be well dispersed, indicating that the modified protein is folded and not aggregating.2.  Make a stock solution of 250m M sodium ascorbate by dissolving it in NMR buffer.3.  After the ^1H-^15N -HSQC spectrum has been acquired of the paramagnetic protein (step D1), remove the NMR tube from the magnet. Using a long pipette that fits into the NMR tube, add sodium ascorbate to a final concentration that is 5× greater than the concentration of the labeled protein. This step should be performed carefully, by pipetting the solution up and down slowly so as to mix the solution, while preventing any sample loss. Addition of sodium ascorbate will reduce MTSL’s unpaired electron to form the diamagnetic state. Let the sample reduce for a minimum of 3h at room temperature (no agitation is needed).4.

PCC 6803 strain used in this study was kindly provided by Prof. Weiwen Zhang (Tianjin University, China). Synechocystis was cultivated in BG-11 media (both solid and liquid)52. For normal growth, the culture was maintained in a shaker photo-incubator under continuous illumination at 25 μmol m−2 s−2, with shaking at 130 rpm and temperature of 30 °C. The mutant culture was supplemented with various antibiotics at different concentrations, as mentioned in the text (for DprqR mutant line, up to 100 μg/mL kanamycin; for CprqR, 100 μg/mL kanamycin + 100 mg/mL spectinomycin; for OEprqR, 100 μg/mL kanamycin; and for DprqR-DprqA, 100 μg/mL kanamycin). For heterotrophic [GLC(+)DARK] growth, 5 mM glucose was added into the culture which was then maintained in the dark by wrapping with aluminum foil while shaking at 130 rpm and temperature of 30 °C. In this study, we maintained a special condition called GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT in which cells were inoculated in liquid BG-11 media and kept for normal culture until the OD730 was around 0.4; we then added 5 mM glucose and placed the samples under GLC(+)DARK condition for 3 days with subsequent shifting into high light (at 80 μmol m−2 s−2) for 2 or 3 days. For plate culture, the solid BG-11 on plate was always maintained in photo-incubator with continuous illumination at 25 μmol m−2 s−2 and temperature of 30 °C. Antibiotics had been used during maintenance or selection of mutant strains but not when comparative study was conducted between WT and different mutants.Cloning strategies, transformation and generation of stable strainsThe constructed vectors and strains developed by transforming those vectors are listed in Fig. S1A. The vectors were constructed by combining the normal restriction-digestion-ligation system and fusion system, as described by Zhang et al.53. The two vector’s backbones, namely, pUC19 and pBluescript KS (+), were used to construct all other vectors. The primers used in these constructions are listed in Supplementary Table S3. The constructed vectors transformed into Synechocystis following the method described by Liu et al.54. Colonies that appeared on the plate were streaked several times (at least 10 times) to obtain complete segregation. The mutant was confirmed by PCR, and positive clones were set in liquid culture supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.In DprqR mutant (“D” stands for deletion), 245 bp out of 645 bp of prqR gene was deleted and a kanamycin cassette was inserted. The CprqR strain (“C” represents complementation) was generated by expressing the prqR gene under psbA2 promoter and spectinomycin under cpcB promoter in DprqR mutant by inserting in a neutral site (NS) at slr1311. For ChIP assay, we attached a 6XHis Tag at the C-terminus of the prqR gene, which was expressed under psbA2 promoter in WT strain at NS site of slr1311. To delete the two neighboring gene prqR and prqA, vector was designed using an upstream fragment of prqR and a downstream fragment of prqA flanked with kanamycin cassette under cpcB promoter.ChIP-PCRChip-PCR was conducted using all reagents and protocols provided by Beyotime (Shanghai, China). Briefly, 40 mL of cell culture was collected from the normal culture of OEprqR strain, crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde and stabilized using 125 mM (final concentration) glycine. Sonication was performed as follows: 1 s ON, 2 s OFF for 18 min with 25% amplitude, to achieve the DNA fragment length of 400 bp to 800 bp. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred (about 0.2 mL) into a 2 mL ice-bathed tube. ChIP was performed in accordance with the protocol given by Beyotime (Shanghai, China).The real time q-PCR was set with a 25 μL system (12.5 μL of SYBR GreeN, 0.5 × 2 Primers, 1 μL of sample, 1 μL of 1% input, 9.5 μL of ddH2O). Three pairs of primers were used for each targeted set (Supplementary Table S4). The DNA sample eluted with normal unconjugated mouse IgG was used as control.Semi-quantitative PCR was set using Taq 2X Master Mix Kit (New England Biolabs Inc). The reaction was set in a 25 μL system (12.5 Taq 2X Master Mix, 0.5 × 2 Primers, 1 μL each of sample and 1% input, and 10.5 ddH2O) for 25 cycles.GC/LC-MS based metabolic profilingFor GC-MS, approximately 3 × 109 cells were collected from the culture under GLC(+)DARK and GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT conditions and placed into −80 °C for at least 2 min to stop further metabolic activity. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold NaCl (0.9%) and placed in tubes in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Up to 1.5 mL of methanol-ddH2O (1:1 v/v) was added along with 10 μL of L-2-chlorophenylalanine (0.3 mg/mL in dH2O). Sonication was conducted as follows: 5 s ON, 10 s OFF for 15 min at 90% amplitude, and then repeated thrice. The supernatant was dried up completely by freeze drying with continuous flow of nitrogen. Samples were derivatized and run under GC-TOF-MS following the method reported by Liu et al.32. The data were acquired in full-scan mode with the m/z range of 30–550 at a rate of 20 spectra per second following a solvent delay of 360 s. The acquired data were processed and analyzed as previously described3255. Metabolite identification was performed by Chroma TOF linked with spectral library databases of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (2005). Other original standards were used to further validate the data. The dataset extracted in MS files from GC/TOFMS analysis was exported into NetCDF format by ChromaTOF software (v3.30, Leco Co., CA). CDF files were processed using custom scripts (revised MATLAB toolbox, hierarchical multivariate curve resolution (H-MCR), developed by Jonsson et al.5657 in MATLAB 7.0 (The Math Works). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with SIMCA-P_12.0 software package (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) and GraphPad Prism version 5.01.For LC-MS analysis, samples with equal cells number were collected at two time points: 72 h under GLC(+)DARK and 24 h under GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT condition. The pellet was centrifuged and collected quickly, frozen in liquid nitrogen and then preserved it at −80 °C before further use. Metabolites were extracted by quenching following the protocol described by Su et. al.33. In quenching metabolites, the frozen pellet was dissolved in 500 μL of 100% LC-MS grade methanol and placed for thawing on dry ice. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. The LC-MS experiment was conducted using an Agilent 1260 series binary HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) attached with an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass analyzer equipped with an electronic spray ion (ESI) source. Aqueous 10 mM tributylamine (pH 4.95, adjusted with acetic acid) and 100% HPLC-grade methanol were used as Mobile Phase A (MPA) and Mobile Phase B (MPB), respectively. Agilent Mass Hunter workstation LC/QQQ acquisition software (version B.04.01) was applied for data processing and Agilent Mass Hunter workstation qualitative analysis software version (B.04.00) applied for statistical analysis. The data obtained were analyzed using SIMCA 12.0 software (for PCA analysis), MeV4_9_0 (for Heat Map), and GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (t-test and others).Growth and chlorophyll content measurementsThe growth models of WT, DprqR and CprqR were studied under normal, GLC(+)DARK and GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT conditions by detecting the optical density (OD) at different wavelengths by using a spectrophotometer (METASH). OD730 was used to determine growth curve. OD678, OD720 and OD750 were also measured, and the total chlorophyll content was quantified using following formula; 14.94 (OD678–OD750)−0.616 (OD720–OD750), described by58.RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCRTotal RNA from 50 mL of culture had been isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the modified method described by Schwarzkopf et al.59. The collected RNA was then treated with DNase1 (RNase free), deactivated DNase1 to remove contaminated DNA following the provided protocol. Thus, the DNA-free RNA was subjected to convert cDNA applying kits, SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed by applying FastStart Universal SYBER Green (ROX) (Roche) reagent in Applied Biosystems 7500 RealTime PCR System. The RNA subunit of ribonuclease P subunit B (rnpB) served as an internal control. The primers used to quantify gene expression are listed in Supplementary Table S4.ROS measurementWe measured the total ROS by using membrane-permeant fluorescence indicator 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate, CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, Life technology), following the protocols described by Hakkila, et al.23 and provided by Life Technology. Samples from normal culture, GLC(+)DARK culture (72 h) and GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT (24 h) were taken to estimate the total ROS content. Up to 25 mM CM-H2DCFDA was added to 1 mL of culture in 2 mL tube and then mixed. About 1 mL of culture was also obtained without adding any CM-H2DCFDA and considered as control (auto-fluorescence). Samples were then incubated for 90 min. in complete dark at 32 °C. Cells were washed with BG-11 media and suspended with BG-11 media to reach the final volume of 0.5 mL. Up to 200 μL of cell suspension was pipetted to a white 96-well microtiter plate. Fluorescence from CM-H2DCFDA treated and untreated cell (auto-fluorescence) was measured using Synergy Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). The data measured immediately after dark incubation were considered as “Initial Reading” and then incubated in the corresponding condition for 1 h and measured the fluorescence for “Final Reading.” The strategy was followed both for treated and untreated (auto-fluorescence) samples. The ROS content was then calculated following the equation, ROS content = (IRT-FRT)-(IRUT-FRUT) where IRT, Initial Reading of Treated sample; FRT, Final Reading of Treated sample; IRUT, Initial Reading of Un-treated sample; and FRUT, Final Reading of Un-treated sample.The excitation and detection emission had been set to 485/20 nm and 535/20 nm respectively with sensitivity at 50, optic position in bottom and normal read speed. BioTek’s Gen5™ 1.10 Reader Control and Data Analysis Software were used to set and analyze the data.Glucose (extracellular) and glycogen measurementsBoth glycogen and glucose were measured described elsewhere60. For glycogen quantification, 3 mL sample was obtained and centrifuged; the pellet was collected and washed with sterile ddH2O and then freeze dried. The weight of the dried cell was recorded. The cell was then suspended in 30% w/v KOH, mixed and incubated at 97 °C for 2 h. Ice-cold ethanol was added to the final concentration of 70% to 75% and incubated on ice for at least 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 98% ethanol. The glycogen pellet was dried at 60 °C for 10 min and then dissolved in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5). The dissolved glycogen was hydrolyzed enzymatically, by treating with 2 mg/mL amyloglucosidase (Sigma) at 60 °C for 2 h, into glucose. The glucose obtained from glycogen and extracellular (in media added externally) was measured using a Glucose (GO) Assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich) in accordance with the manufacture’s protocol. For glycogen measurement, data were normalized by cell dry weight. To understand the glucose uptake ability of the cell, kinetics of the decrease of the glucose content in the growth medium under GLC(+)DARK and GLC(+)DARK-LIGHT conditions were calculated. The data was normalized by OD730 according to time duration.","xml_path":"data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC5007503.xml"},"protocol":{"title":"Single-molecule Analysis of DNA Replication Dynamics in Budding Yeast and Human Cells by DNA Combing","text":"Single-molecule Analysis of DNA Replication Dynamics in Budding Yeast and Human Cells by DNA Combing\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

Saccharomyces cerevisiaeS. cerevisiae cells are unable to incorporate BrdU into DNA because they lack the nucleotide salvage pathway that enables uptake of extracellular thymidine or its analogs. To circumvent this problem, strains for molecular combing have been engineered to ectopically express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter, inserted at the URA3 locus on chromosome V (strain PP872; genetic background: W303; genotype: MATa, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ura3, GAL, psi+, RAD5, ura3::URA3-GPDTK7) (Lengronne et al., 2001; Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006). Cells bearing one integrated copy of the HSV-TK ^+ hENT1 vector (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) (Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006) show comparable levels of BrdU incorporation to cells with seven copies of HSV-TK alone (Bianco et al., 2012).Note: DNA molecular combing procedure doesn’t differ for fission yeast excepted for growth and labelling conditions (Kaykov et al., 2016).1.  BrdU labeling of synchronized HU-arrested cells and preparation of DNA genomic plugsa.  Grow cells overnight at _25°0 to a density of 5×10^6 cells/ml in 100ml of YPAD.b.  Add a -factor (2u/mI) at  T_0 in order to synchronized cells in G1. A second (4u/ml) and a third dose (2u/mI) of a -factor are added part way at respectively T_1h and T_2h to ensure that cells do not escape the G_1 arrest. Note: The length of G_1 synchronisation varies from 2.5 to 3h depending on the doubling time of yeast strains. Make sure that cells are in G_1 (unbudded cells) before the release into S phase (Figure 1).c.  Add (i) BrdU to a final concentration of 400ugim/ml (or 40ugim/ml if cells express the nucleotide transporter hENT1), and (ii) Hydroxyurea (HU, 200~m M_ ) at least 15 m i n before releasing cells into S phase. Note: Elongation from early-firing origins is inhibited with the addition of HU in order to restrict the length of newly replicated regions to 10k b .d.  Release cells from α-factor arrest into S phase by addition of 50 u/m l Pronase (degrades alpha factor peptide in medium). Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.0 with potassium phosphate buffer.e.  After 90min , collect cells by centrifugation at 4^°C ; 1,096xg in a 50ml tube containing cold 0.1% NaN3 (sodium azide). Note: Sodium azide inhibits cytochrome oxidase (last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria or bacteria) by binding irreversibly to the heme cofactor and stops all cell metabolism, including DNA replication.f.  Resuspend the cells in one volume of cold TE50, 0.1% NaN3 and keep them on ice. Check cells under a microscope (Nikon YS100). More than 90% of the cells should display small buds, which are indicative of entry into S phase (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Yeast cell morphology in G_1 and early S phase. A. G1 synchronised yeast cells; B. Yeast cells in S phase + H U after release from G1 for 90 m i n .2.  Preparation of genomic DNA plugs Genomic DNA is prepared in low melting point (LMP) agarose plugs to prevent mechanical shearing.a.  Freshly prepare molten 2% LMP agarose in bi-distilled water and Zymolyase buffer. Keep at 42^°C in thermomixer until use.b.  Determine cell concentration with a cell counter.c.  Wash cells once with NZ buffer.d.  Resuspend cells in prewarmed Zymolyase buffer (42^°C) to a final concentration of 4×10^8 cells/ml and carefully mixed with an equal volume of molten 2% LMP agarose (42^°C) . Note: The Zymolyase will digest the cell wall.e.  Transfer the cellular suspension into a plug mold sealed with tape to generate 90~ul plugs (Figure 2) containing 2×10^7 cells or approximately 350 ng of genomic DNA per plug at room temperature. Note: Prepare at least 4 plugs per sample.f.  Cover molds with a plastic film (Figure 2) and incubate for 30 min at 37^°C .()Figure 2. Pictures of a plug mold. A and B. Top and bottom views; C. Plug mold sealed with a tape and covered with a saran plastic film.g.  Place agarose plugs at 4 °C for 10 min to let the agarose solidify.h.  Transfer plugs into 14ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes using a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb and incubate them at 37^°C in Proteinase K buffer (2 ml for 4 plugs) for 1 h under gentle agitation. Transfer plugs into fresh Proteinase K buffer and incubate for ^24~h~ at 37~^°C . Repeat once for an additional ^24h . Note: Incubation with P K buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching.i. Wash plugs for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on a roller mixer at room temperature. Change the buffer from time to time.j. Keep plugs at 4~^°C in TE50 buffer until use (stable for months). Note that DNA plugs are translucent and fragile.# bio-protocol# B.  Human cellsNote: This protocol is available for any kind of mammalian cells.1.  BrdU labelling and preparation of DNA genomic plugs Unlike budding yeast, human cells cannot be easily synchronized and experiments are usually performed with asynchronous cultures. Under these conditions, it is critical to use a combination of two modified nucleotides (IdU and CldU) to determine the polarity of replication forks and the position of initiation sites (Figure 3). (Conti et al., 2007)()Figure 3. Schematic patterns obtained by DNA combing after IdU/CldU pulses in asynchronous mammalian cells. To determine fork velocity, green tracks adjacent to red tracks are measured in B, C, E. Stalled forks are represented in A and E and interorigin distances (IOD) in B and D. ORI: origin of replication. Arrows indicate fork direction. F. Schematic pattern obtained by DNA combing after BrdU pulse in synchronized budding yeast cells.a.  Grow cells to a confluence of about 70% in 6-well plates. At the time of the experiment each well need to contain a minimum of 1×10^5 cells.b.  Label cells by adding IdU ( 20uM final) directly in 2 ml medium.c.  Incubate cells at 37^°C for at least 10 min.d.  Replace medium with ^2mI of prewarmed medium containing 200~uM CldU. Incubate cells at 37^°C for 20m i n . Note: To avoid thermal shock and other perturbations, add nucleotides directly to growth medium (first pulse). Use prewarmed medium and a much higher concentration for the second pulse to avoid washes. The range of IdU/CldU staining time should be adjusted for each cell line from 10 to 30 min depending on S phase duration.e.  Rinse cells with PBS and trypsinize cells as usual, adjust trypsinization time to cell type. For instance, incubate cells for 3-5 min in 0.05% trypsin, 1 mM EDTA.f.  Collect cells, place them on ice and spin for 5 min at 1,000 xg at 4^°C . Keep the cells on ice until use (to stop DNA synthesis).# 2.  Preparation of genomic DNA plugsa.  Resuspend cells in 5ml cold PBS, spin for 5 min at 1,000 xg at 4^°C and resuspend in 1 ml cold PBS.b.  Count cells and resuspend at 8×10^5 to 2×10^6 cells/ml in cold PBS, depending on cell size.c.  Prepare a solution of 2% LMP agarose in PBS and keep at 42^°C until use.d.  Add an equal volume of 2% LMP agarose to cells. To prepare 4 plugs, add 200~ul of 2% LMP agarose solution to 200ul of prewarmed cells solution.e.  Mix very gently with a P1000 pipetman (optional: cut tip).f.  Transfer 90ul per plug into a plug mold sealed with tape.g.  Let plugs solidify for 25 min at room temperature and for 10 min at 4^°C .h.  Use a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb to eject plugs into 14ml round-bottom tubes containing 0.5ml of Proteinase K buffer per plug. Mix gently on roller mixer and change the PK buffer after 1 h.i.  Incubate for 48h at 37~^°C . Change the PK solution twice more during this incubation. Mix gently on a roller mixer. Note: Incubation with P K buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching.j. Gently remove the solution by blocking the agarose plug with a cell scraper. Plugs are transparent and difficult to manipulate after PK treatment.k.  Wash plugs several times for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on the roller mixer at room temperature.l.  Store at 4^°C in TE50 until use. Genomic DNA is stable for months at 4^°C in T E_50 buffer.# bio-protocolC.  Procedures common to yeast and human cells1.  Melting of agarose plugs containing genomic DNAa.  Transfer a plug in a 12ml round-bottom tube. Plugs are washed 3 times for 1 h in 1x TE pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl.b.  After removing of the last wash, add 100 μl 1x TE and 1.5ul YOYO-1 to stain genomic DNA. Keep in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Note: YOYO staining is lost after DNA denaturation but is used to check combing before detection.c.  Wash 4 times for 5 min with 10 ml 1x TE with gentle shaking.d.  Wash once for 5 min with 2 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl.e.  Replace with 3 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl. Note: Increase the volume of MES if fiber density is too high after combing. The pH of MES is critical to obtain a correct density and stretching of DNA fibers.f.  Incubate for 15-30 min for human cells and 45 min for yeast cells at 67^°C in a heating block. Note: From now on, manipulate samples with extreme care to avoid DNA shearing.g.  Check the DNA solution. If the shape of the plug is still visible, put it back at 67~^°C until complete melting.h.  Let the solution cool down to 42^°C before adding  -agarase (3 U per plug).i. Incubate overnight at 42^°C .j. Visually inspect the DNA solution. If you still see agarose aggregates; add  -agarase (1 U per plug) for 2 more hours.k.  Incubate at 65^°C for 10 min and store at room temperature in dim light until use.# 2.  DNA combingDNA combing is performed on silanized coverslips as described (Bensimon et al., 1994; Lengronne et al., 2001; Michalet et al., 1997). The quality of silanized coverslips is critical for the subsequent analysis of replication profiles. The whole procedure using the genomic vision device can be visualized on this video: https://youtu.be/LjjpYby3YIk.a.  Carefully pour the DNA solution into a 2 ml Teflon reservoir. Save the rest for further use. Note: Genomics Vision sells disposable 2 ml plastic reservoirs to melt plug directly in the reservoir and avoid manipulation of the DNA solution.b.  Insert a silanized coverslip into the DNA solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.c.  Using a DNA combing device, remove carefully the coverslip from the reservoir at a constant speed of 300um/sec . Repeat with another coverslip as many times as needed (2 slides per sample is usually sufficient).d.  At this stage, DNA is stretched on both sides of the coverslip. Visualize DNA fibers on one side under the microscope (Nikon YS100) using a 40× objective and a FITC filter block. To this aim, fix with tape the coverslip to a metal coverslip holder, put a drop of immersion oil directly on the coverslip to visualize DNA fibers.e.  Place the coverslip on a sheet of Whatman paper to soak up oil and bake for ^z_h at 60~^°C to crosslink DNA to coverslips.f.  Stick the oiled side of coverslips on glass slides with cyanoacrylate glue. Label slides with a diamond tip engraving pen and store at -20~^°C until use. Note: If needed, some steps presented in A2/B2 and C1/C2 sections can be modified to increase the length of stretched DNA molecules as described (Kaykov et al., 2016). If the density of fibers is too low, the DNA solution can be kept for a few days at 4^°C to increase DNA resuspension in MES buffer before combing.# 3.  ImmunodetectionSpecific combinations of primary and secondary antibodies are used to detect BrdU or CldU/IdU and DNA fibers simultaneously.a.  Dehydrate slides for 5 min in successive baths of 70% , 90% and 100% ethanol in Coplin jar. Let air dry the slides.b.  Incubate in Coplin jar for 25 min in freshly prepared 1 N NaOH to denature the DNA duplex. Note: Prolonged incubation in NaOH degrades the silane layer and should be avoided.c.  Wash extensively with PBS pH 7.4 to neutralize NaOH (5 washes of 1 min each).d.  Saturate slides for 15 min in PBS/T containing 1% BSA.e.  Add 20~ul of PBS/T containing primary antibodies and cover with a coverslip. Incubate for 45 min at 37^°C in a humid chamber.f.  Wash 5 min ×2 times with PBS/T in Coplin jar. Note: Dip slide in a Coplin jar containing PBS/T in order to remove the upper coverslip without damaging the DNA fibers.g.  Detect with secondary antibodies (30 min at 37^°C in a humid chamber).h.  Wash 5 min x 3 times with PBS/T in Coplin Jar.i. Air dry slides and mount by adding 5ul Prolong Gold Antifade reagent on coverslip covered with a second coverslip. Let mounting reagent polymerize for at least ^2~h~ at room temperature (preferably overnight and protect from light) before proceeding with microscopy. Mounted coverslips are stable for months at -20~^°C .# 4.  Image acquisition and data analysisa.  Image acquisition is performed with a 40× objective on a motorized microscope equipped with a camera and controlled with Zeiss ZEN Pro 2 software or equivalent (Figure 4). The conversion factor (CF) from pixel to bp (C F=P/M×S) depends on the pixel size of the CCD camera (P in mu m ), on the magnification of the objective (M) and on the stretching of DNA fibers ( 5,2k b/u m for DNA combing). DNA molecules of known length, such as concatemers of bacteriophage lambda DNA, can be used as size standards.b.  BrdU tracks and DNA fibers can be measured manually with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) or open source software such as ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Data are transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. DNA fiber identification and length measurements can be automated with software like IDeFIx, developed by the DNA combing facility of# bio-protocolMontpellier (IGMM, CNRS) or software developed by Genomic Vision. Critical issues regarding potential biases and limitations of DNA fiber analysis have been extensively discussed elsewhere (Techer et al., 2013; Tuduri et al., 2010).()Figure 4. Representative examples of replication patterns observed by DNA combing. Aand B. Yeast cells were released from G1 in the presence of 200 mM HU and labeled with BrdU for 90 min. DNA fibers were purified and stretched by DNA combing. BrdU and ssDNA were detected as indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. C and D. Human cells were labeled for 15 min with IdU and 60 min with CldU. The combination of antibodies used to detect IdU, CldU and ssDNA is indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. Image acquisition is performed with a motorized Leica DM6000B microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (6.45um/pixel) and a 40× oil immersion objective. With this setup and a DNA stretching of 2k b/u m , one pixel corresponds to (6.45/40)×2=323b p.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nS. cerevisiae cells are unable to incorporate BrdU into DNA because they lack the nucleotide salvage pathway that enables uptake of extracellular thymidine or its analogs.\nStrains for molecular combing have been engineered to ectopically express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter, inserted at the URA3 locus on chromosome V.\nCells bearing one integrated copy of the HSV-TK+ hENT1 vector show comparable levels of BrdU incorporation to cells with seven copies of HSV-TK alone.\n## BrdU Labeling of Synchronized HU-Arrested Cells and Preparation of DNA Genomic Plugs\n## Cell Growth and Synchronization\nGrow cells overnight at 25°C to a density of 5×10^6 cells/ml in 100ml of YPAD.\nAdd α-factor (2μM) at T0 to synchronize cells in G1.\nAdd a second (4μM) and a third dose (2μM) of α-factor at T1h and T2h to ensure that cells do not escape the G1 arrest.\n## BrdU Labeling\nAdd BrdU to a final concentration of 400μg/ml (or 40μg/ml if cells express the nucleotide transporter hENT1).\nAdd Hydroxyurea (HU, 200mM) at least 15 minutes before releasing cells into S phase.\n## Cell Release and Collection\nRelease cells from α-factor arrest into S phase by addition of 50μM Pronase.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 4°C;

Origin activation follows a well-defined replication timing program that is controlled by checkpoint kinases and epigenetic modifications of chromatin (Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016). Replication forks frequently stall during a normal S phase. Fork arrest is caused by multiple events, such as DNA lesions, tightly bound protein complexes, and transcription at highly expressed genes (Tourriere and Pasero 2007; Zeman and Cimprich, 2013). Eukaryotes have developed different strategies to deal with this replication stress, including repair mechanisms to restart arrested forks and activation of dormant replication origins to rescue terminally-arrested forks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2305"}}
