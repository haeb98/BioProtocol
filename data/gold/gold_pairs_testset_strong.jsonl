C. jejuni strains were cultured at 37°C or 42°C on Blood Agar Base No. 2 (BA) medium containing 5% horse blood or in Heart Infusion broth (HI; Oxoid), under microaerobic conditions (5% O2, 7.5% CO2, 7.5% H2, 80% N2), or under oxygen limited conditions (0.3% O2, 10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2). Kanamycin (25 μg ml-1) and/or chloramphenicol (15 μg ml-1) were added when appropriate. E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1), kanamycin (30 μg ml-1), or chloramphenicol (30 μg ml-1).Construction of C. jejuni ggt, racS, and racRS MutantsTo inactivate the ggt gene, the ggt gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides Cjj67Sac and Cjj67Xba (Table 2). The obtained PCR product was digested with ClaI and PstI resulting in a 1.2-kb DNA fragment, which was ligated into pBluescript II KS to give plasmid pUWM799. Plasmid pUWM799 was digested with BglII to remove a 0.1-kb internal ggt fragment and was ligated to a 0.8-kb BamHI fragment containing the cat cassette (0.8 kb) of pRY109. The resulting ggt knockout construct pUWM804 contained the cat cassette in the same orientation as the ggt gene.To construct the racS and racRS knockout constructs plasmid pGEM1261 (van der Stel et al., 2015), containing the genes Cj1261–Cj1263 was amplified by PCR using the primers RacSendBamHI/RacSstart2BamHI or Cj1261FBamHI/RacSendBamHI, respectively. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated to a 0.8-kb BamHI cat cassette from pAV35 (Vliet et al., 1998), resulting in plasmids pGEM1262::Cm and pGEM1261-1262::Cm, respectively.The genes ggt, racS, and the racRS were disrupted in C. jejuni strain 81116 or 81-176 by natural transformation using the knock-out plasmids pUWM804, pJET1262::Cm and pGEM1261-1262::Cm, respectively. Double cross-over recombination events were confirmed by PCR.Construction of racRS Complementation StrainTo complement the racRS mutant, the complementation plasmid pMA1–1261–1263 (van der Stel et al., 2015) was first transformed into E. coli S17 and then conjugated (Labigne-Roussel et al., 1987) to the racRS::Cm mutant strain.Purification of Recombinant RacR and Cytoplasmic RacSRacR (N-His) and RacScyto (N-His) were expressed and purified as described before (Wösten et al., 2004) using plasmids pT7.7-RacR(N-his) and pT7.7-RacScyto(N-his). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Construction of ggt Promoter Luciferase ConstructsTo localize where RacR binds on the ggt promoter, different lengths of the upstream region of the ggt gene were amplified by PCR. The PCRs were generated by fusion polymerase (Thermo) with Cj81116 genomic DNA as template and one of the primer pairs GGT28/GGT204, GGT28/GGT104, GGT28/GGT69, or GGT28/GGT35. The PCR products were digested with SacI and SphI (Thermo) and cloned into SacI, SphI digested plasmid pMA5-metK-luc (Bouwman et al., 2013) to replace the metK promoter. To obtain a promotorless luciferase vector, pMA5-metK-luc was digested with SacI and SphI, blunted with the blunting enzyme from the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo) and finally self-ligated. The plasmids were verified by sequencing (Macrogen). The obtained plasmids were transformed to E. coli S17 and subsequently conjugated to C. jejuni 81116 and the racRS mutant.Real-Time RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from late logarithmic phase C. jejuni cultures grown in HI medium at 42°C under oxygen limiting conditions with the addition of 50 mM nitrate, using RNA-BeeTM kit (Tel-Test, Inc) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (van der Stel et al., 2015). Primers used in this assay are listed in Table 2. Experiments were repeated with three independently grown cultures. Fold increase was calculated with the 2ΔΔCt method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008) using rpoD as reference gene.GGT Activity AssayTo assay the GGT activity the production of 3-carboxy-4-nitroaniline was followed by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm according to a modified procedure described by (Chevalier et al., 1999). Briefly, 1 mL of bacterial culture was pelleted and stored at −80°C for at least 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μL buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 1 μg/mL lysozyme), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Next, the bacteria were disrupted by sonication followed by centrifugation (10 min at 12000 × g at 4°C). From the cell free bacterial lysate 20 μl was mixed together with 180 μl of a reagent containing 2.9 mM L-γ-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide, 100 mM glycylglycine and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). Samples were measured every 60 s during an incubation period of 30 min at 37°C. From these graphs the slope of all values in a linear range was calculated. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). GGT activity is expressed as nmol min-1 mg protein-1. The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Luciferase AssayExpression of the luciferase in C. jejuni 81116 and racRS mutant strain harboring the pMA5-ggtprom-luc plasmids was measured as previously described (Bouwman et al., 2013). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted to an OD550 nm of 0.05 and grown for 7.5 h in HI with 50 mM KNO3 in an oxygen limiting atmosphere at 37°C. One milliliter of each culture was pelleted (8000 ×g, 5 min, 4°C) and suspended in 100 μL RLB buffer (Promega) supplemented with 0.5% Triton-X100. Suspensions were stored at −80°C for at least 30 min to disrupt the bacteria. Bacterial lysate (20 μL) was mixed with 50 μL of luciferase reagent (Promega) and RLU’s were measured immediately on a luminometer (TD20/20, Turner Designs). The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Gel Mobility Shift AssayThe promoter regions upstream of ggt, phoX (Cj0145), and Cj0200c were amplified by PCR using Dreamtaq polymerase (Thermo) and one of the primers sets GGTpromDIG/GGT204, GGTpromDIG/GGT104, GGTpromDIG/GGT69, GGTpromDIG/GGT35, Cj145F/CJ0145RDIG, and Cj200F/Cj200RDIG, respectively, (Table 2) and Cj81116 chromosomal DNA as template. Primers GGTpromDIG, Cj0145RDIG, and Cj200RDIG were ordered with a digoxigenin (DIG) label (Eurofins genomics). Approximately, 50 fmol DIG-labeled PCR fragments was incubated with His-tagged RacR, RacScyto, and 2 mM ATP for 30 min on ice. RacR, RacScyto, and ATP were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C to allow phosphorylation. The binding buffer used for protein-DNA incubations was 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml poly-(dI-dC) and 10% glycerol. Samples (10 μl) were run on a 4% non-denaturing Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel at 4°C. After electrophoresis the DNA was blotted on a hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham) and PCR fragments were visualized using α-DIG-AP, Fab fragments, and CSPD substrate (Roche).Growth CurvesCampylobacter jejuni precultures were grown for 7 h in HI medium with the addition of 50 mM nitrate at oxygen limiting conditions at 42°C. The precultures were diluted 50 times in 300 μL DMEM (without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate, bicarbonate, and phenol red, D5030, Sigma) with the addition of 10 mM TMAO and 10 mM glutamate, glutamine or aspartate, and growth curves were generated at 42°C in a 100 well honeycomb plate which was continuously shaking in a Bioscreen C MRB (Oy Growth Curves Ab) computer-controlled incubator. The incubator was placed inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Labs, Grass Lake, MI, USA), due to suboptimal gas exchange in the honeycomb plate the oxygen concentration was set to 1%, which yielded comparable growth as when bacteria were grown in rectangular flasks inside an anaerobic jar containing 0.3% O2. The OD600nm of cultures was recorded every 15 min during 45 h. For clarity reasons only point at 2.5 h, or 5 h intervals are shown. Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate.Statistical AnalysisPrism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Results are shown as mean ± SEM. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed with Bonferroni post hoc tests; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Measurement of Acid Ecto-phosphatase Activity in Live Leishmania donovani Parasites", "keywords": " Ecto-enzymes, Acid ecto-phosphatases, Enzymatic assay in live cells, Leishmania sp, phosphatase activity, Tartate sensitivity", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3384", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Leishmania Promastigote Axenic Culture"}, "1.1": {"title": "Thawing and Initial Culture"}, "1.1.1": "Thaw the cells quickly by immersing the vial in a beaker with water at 25°C.", "1.1.2": "Transfer the cells with a sterile 1 ml pipette into a falcon tube with 9 ml culture medium (RPMI 1640-GlutaMax, supplemented with 10% (v/v) hiFBS, 40 mM HEPES, and antibiotics).", "1.1.3": "Resuspend and centrifuge at 1000×g for 7 min at RT.", "1.2": {"title": "Culture Maintenance"}, "1.2.1": "Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 10 ml culture medium.", "1.2.2": "Transfer into a 25 cm^2 flask and close the cap (without filter).", "1.2.3": "Culture at 25°C in the absence of CO2.", "1.3": {"title": "Parasite Subculturing and Harvesting"}, "1.3.1": "Perform parasite subculturing at 10^6 parasites/ml.", "1.3.2": "Harvest parasites by centrifugation (1000×g, 7 min at RT).", "1.4": {"title": "Culture Conditions for L. tarentolae Promastigotes"}, "1.4.1": "Culture L. tarentolae promastigotes at 25°C in Brain Heart Infusion (Lexsy Broth BHI) medium supplemented with hemin (5 μM) at a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v), 10 μM L-biopterin, and penicillin-streptomycin (1×).", "1.5": {"title": "Genetically Modified Parasites Culture"}, "1.5.1": "Culture genetically modified parasites in similar conditions with the parental strains but with the addition of Nourseothricin (100 μg/ml) when the genetic modification was performed with plasmids based on the pLEXSY-sat2 vector.", "1.6": {"title": "Parasite Maintenance"}, "1.6.1": "Subculture L. donovani strains (10^7 cells) once a week by removing 9 ml of the old culture and complementing with 9 ml of fresh medium (1/10 dilution).", "1.7": {"title": "Cell Counting"}, "1.7.1": "Remove a small volume of the culture (100 μl) for counting the cells with a hemocytometer (Malassez).", "1.7.2": "Transfer the sample into an Eppendorf tube containing 900 μl 2% (w/v) formalin at RT.", "1.7.3": "Wait for 2-3 min.", "1.7.4": "Take 100 μl and place in one chamber of the hemocytometer.", "1.7.5": "Observe under the microscope with a 40× magnification lens.", "1.7.6": "Count the cells in several or all the large squares (each square has an area of 0.05 mm^2 and 0.2 mm depth representing a volume of 0.01 mm^3 = 10^-5 ml).", "1.7.7": "Divide the number of cells counted by the number of squares observed and multiply by 10^5/ml.

If the parasite culture is less dense, dilute in a smaller volume of formalin before counting.B. Protocol of assaying acid ecto-phosphatase in live Leishmania promastigotesThe acid ecto-phosphatase activity at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes, is assayed at 25~^°C or 37^°C for 30 min with the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) ( 10m M) in a 90~m M citrate buffer at p H4.8 (Sigma-Aldrich), with or without sodium tartrate (5 mM ,L(+) tartaric acid; Merck). Hydrolysis of the esteric bond and dephosphorylation of p N P P produces the p -nitro-phenol compound which after terminating the reaction by the addition of 0.5N N a O H is quantified by measuring its absorbance at 405n m (Figure 2).()(p-nitro-pnenol)Figure 2. Diagram of the enzymatic reaction of dephosphorylation of the pNPP substrate. The acid ecto-phosphatase reaction at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes can be carried out either at the logarithmic phase of growth (48-72 h post inoculation of the culture) or at the static phase of growth ( ^6^th or 7^th day post-inoculation).1.

Count cells (as in step 11, A) and assess cell viability by visual inspection under the microscope of the parasite motility (dispense 50~ul of cell suspension on a microscope slide and observe with a 4× lens) and quantitation by staining with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue (i.e., as in Trypan Blue Staining protocol). Counting and cell viability could be performed simultaneously.4. Centrifuge the large volume of the cell suspension (1,000× g,7m i n) .5. Discard the supernatant (S/N).6. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500~ul reaction solution containing the phosphatase substrate pnitrophenyl phosphate ( 10m MpN P P in a 90m M citrate buffer, p H4.8. , with or without sodium tartrate 5 mM L(+). -tartaric acid prewarmed in the appropriate temperature of the reaction (25 ^° or at 37 ^°C_. ).7. Incubate cells in the reaction mixture at 25~^°C or 37~^°C for 30m i n .8. Terminate the reaction by the addition of 0.5 N NaOH ( 1 ml/ sample).9. Remove the parasites by centrifugation (2,000× g,5m i n) .10. Transfer the S/N in a plastic cuvette for spectrophotometric analysis.11. Measure the absorbance of the reaction product ( p -nitrophenolate =pN P ) at 405n m .12. Calculate the enzyme activity (A405 values) and normalize for the mean number of cells/ml for each independent experiment (A405/10^7c e l l s/m l) .13. Evaluate the acid phosphatase activity due to cell lysis under the reaction conditions as follows: a. Incubate reaction buffer, equal volume to the phosphatase assay for each cell type, with the same number of Leishmania promastigotes used for each reaction, in the absence of substrate for 30m i n , at 25~^°C or 37~^°C depending on the temperature you are performing the reaction. b.

MDA‐MB‐231 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (1:1) (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FBS. MCF10AT1k.cl2 and MCF10CA1a.cl1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (HS), 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 8.5 ng/ml cholera toxin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone. All media were supplemented with 1% penicillin G‐streptomycin sulfate (Euroclone) and 1% l‐glutamine (Euroclone). Cells were maintained in culture at 37°C, with 5% CO2. For experiments performed in hypoxic conditions, cells were cultured for 24 h in a modular incubator chamber at 37°C, with 5% CO2, 94% N2, and 1% O2. O2 levels were monitored by LabQuest2‐Interface and Oxygen Sensor (ML Systems). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination. siRNAs (10 pmoles/cm2) were transfected using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Life Technologies). Expression plasmids were transfected using LT1 reagent (Mirus).siRNAThe following MCU‐targeting sequences were designed: siRNA‐MCU#1: 5′‐GCCAGAGACAGACAAUACUtt‐3′.siRNA‐MCU#2: 5′‐UAAUUGCCCUCCUUUAUAUtt‐3′.

Morgenstern & B. Weinberg, Addgene plasmid #1764), and pCL‐Eco (a gift from I.

Infected cells were selected by treatment with 1 μg/ml puromycin.For HIF‐1α overexpression in MDA‐MB‐231 cells, retroviral particles were produced by co‐transfection of recombinant shuttle vector pCL‐Eco and pBABE vectors (pBABE‐puro, HA‐HIF1α‐wt‐pBABE, HA‐HIF1α‐P402A/P564A‐pBABE).Generation of MCU −/− MDA‐MB‐231 cell linesTo generate MCU −/− MDA‐MB‐231 cell lines, two Cas9 guides targeting different regions of the human MCU gene were designed (TGGCGGCTGACGCCCAGCCC for clone1 and GATCGCTTCCTGGCAGAATT for clone2) and cloned into the BsmBI site of the LentiCrisprV2 plasmid, a kind gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #52961). MDA‐MB‐231 cells were infected with lentiviral particles produced as described above and selected with puromycin for one week. Dilution cloning was performed to obtain different monoclonal cell populations that were screened and validated for MCU gene ablation by Western blot. LentiCrisprV2 plasmid was used to produce control clones.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used: anti‐MCU (1:1,000, HPA016480, Sigma‐Aldrich), anti‐β‐tubulin (1:5,000, sc9104, Santa Cruz), anti‐HIF‐1α (1:500, 610958, Becton Dickinson), and anti‐hydroxy‐HIF‐1α (1:1,000, 3434, Cell Signaling).Ca2+ measurementsFor measurements of [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit, cells grown on 12‐mm round glass coverslips were infected with cytosolic (Ad‐cytAEQ) or low‐affinity mitochondrial (Ad‐mtAEQmut) probes, as described (Bonora et al, 2013). Forty‐eight hours later, cells were incubated with 5 μM coelenterazine for 2 h in Krebs‐Ringer modified buffer (KRB) (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na3PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) at 37°C supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, and transferred to the perfusion chamber, and Ca2+ transients were evoked by agonist treatments. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB, and agonists were added to the same medium.For SOCC activity measurements, cells grown on 12‐mm round glass coverslips were infected with Ad‐cytAEQ. Forty‐eight hours later cells were incubated with coelenterazine, as described above, and transferred to the perfusion chamber. After 1 min of perfusion with 100 μM EGTA in KRB, agonists and other drugs were added for 2 min, in order to empty intracellular Ca2+ stores. Next, cells were perfused with KRB containing 2 mM Ca2+ together with agonist or drugs, as indicated.All aequorin experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μM digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+‐rich solution (10 mM CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as previously described (Bonora et al, 2013).For measurements of resting mitochondrial [Ca2+], cells were grown on 24‐mm coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding 4mtGCaMP6f. After 24 h, coverslips were placed in 1 ml of KRB and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 40×/1.4 N.A. PlanFluar objective. Excitation was performed with a DeltaRAM V high‐speed monochromator (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp. Images were captured with a high‐sensitivity Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD (Photometrics). The system is controlled by MetaFluor 7.5 (Molecular Devices) and was assembled by Crisel Instruments. In order to perform quantitative measurements, we took advantage of the isosbestic point in the GCaMP6f excitation spectrum: we experimentally determined in living cells that exciting GCaMP6f at 410 nm leads to fluorescence emission, which is not Ca2+ dependent. As a consequence, the ratio between 474‐nm and 410‐nm excitation wavelengths is proportional to [Ca2+] while independent of probe expression (Hill et al, 2014). Cells were thus alternatively illuminated at 474 and 410 nm, and fluorescence was collected through a 515/30‐nm band‐pass filter (Semrock). Exposure time was set to 200 ms at 474 nm and to 400 ms at 410 nm, in order to account for the low quantum yield at the latter wavelength. At least 15 fields were collected per coverslip, and each field was acquired for 10 s (1 frame/s). Analysis was performed with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al, 2012). Both images were background corrected frame by frame by subtracting mean pixel values of a cell‐free region of interest. Data are presented as the mean of the averaged ratio of all time points.Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) measurementsCells were incubated with 20 nM tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester dye (TMRM) (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37°C. TMRM fluorescence was measured by FACS. The probe was excited at 560 nm, and the emission light was recorded in the 590–650 nm range; 10 μM FCCP (carbonyl cyanide‐p‐trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was added after 12 acquisitions to completely collapse the ∆Ψ. Data are expressed as difference of TMRM fluorescence before and after FCCP depolarization.Measurements of NADH/NADPH levels and redox stateFor fluorescence lifetime measurements, cells were plated onto 22‐mm glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight before imaging. At the microscope, coverslips were held at 37°C in a metal ring and bathed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) containing 25 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, buffered by 10 mM HEPES; 720‐nm two‐photon excitation from a Chameleon (Coherent) Ti:sapphire laser was directed through an upright LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 1.0 NA 40× water‐dipping objective. A 650‐nm short‐pass dichroic and 460 ± 25 nm emission filter separated NAD(P)H fluorescence from the incident illumination. On‐sample powers were kept below 10 mW, and emission events were registered by an external detector (HPM‐100, Becker & Hickl) attached to a commercial time‐correlated single‐photon counting electronics module (SPC‐830, Becker & Hickl). Scanning was performed continuously for 2 min with a pixel dwell time of 1.6 μs. Subsequent NAD(P)H FLIM data analysis was performed using the procedures detailed in Blacker et al (2014).For measuring NAD(P)H redox state, cells were plated as described above and imaged using a Zeiss 510 META UV‐VIS confocal microscope. The blue autofluorescence emitted by the pyridine nucleotides NADH and NADPH in their reduced form was excited with a UV laser (Coherent; at 351 nm), and emission was collected using a 435‐nm to 485‐nm band‐pass filter. To measure the dynamic range of the signal in relation to the fully reduced and oxidized NAD(P)H pool, cells were exposed to carbonyl cyanide 4‐(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP [1 μM] to stimulate respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H oxidation) and rotenone ([5 μM] to inhibit respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H reduction). The final formula used to normalize the NAD(P)H autofluorescence measurements was (F − FFCCP)/(Frotenone − F). Quantitative analysis of the images obtained was done using the ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).ROS production measurementsTo determine mitochondrial superoxide levels, cells were loaded with 2 mM MitoSOX™ Red reagent (Life Technologies) for 15 min at 37°C. Images were taken on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200) equipped with a PlanFluar 60×/1.4 NA objective, a Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD, and a 75 W Xenon arc lamp coupled to a monochromator (PTI Deltaram V). The system was assembled by Crisel Instruments. MitoSOX™ Red excitation was performed at ~510 nm, and emission was collected at 580 nm. Maximal ROS production was induced with 2.5 μM Antimycin‐A (Sigma‐Aldrich). Images were taken every 10 s with a fixed 200 ms exposure time. Data were analyzed by ImageJ software.To determine GSSG/GSH and H2O2 levels, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HyperRed, pLPCXmitGrx1‐roGFP2, and pHyPer‐dMito. To measure mitochondrial pH, SypHer2 plasmid was used. SypHer2 originates from a mutation in a cysteine residue of HyPer that renders it insensitive to H2O2 but does not affect the pH sensitivity. Images were acquired every 5 s using a Cell Observer High Speed (Zeiss) microscope equipped with 40× oil Fluar (N.A. 1.3) objective, CFP (Semrock HC), YFP and RFP (Zeiss) single‐band filters, 420 and 505 nm LED's (Colibri, Zeiss), and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Maximal ROS production was induced with 100 μM H2O2. To calculate fluorescence ratios, background intensity was subtracted and images were corrected for linear crosstalk. pHyPer‐dMito and pLPCXmitGrx1‐roGFP2 ratios were calculated by AxioVision software (Zeiss) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft). HyperRed fluorescence was analyzed by ImageJ software.Cell death and cell cycle detectionCell cycle and cell death induction after MCU silencing were measured by cytofluorometry. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were identified by labeling with FITC‐Annexin V (Roche) and propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C and analyzing cells by FACS (FACS Canto II, BD BioSciences). Data were processed using the BD Vista software.Wound healing migration assayFor wound healing assays, cells were seeded at low confluency (30%) in 6‐well plates, transfected with siRNA, and cultured in medium without serum. The day after, a linear scratch was obtained on cell monolayers through a vertically held P200 tip and medium was replaced. Images were taken at the indicated time points (time 0 as reference). “TScratch” software (www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/software/) was used for automated image analysis.Clonogenic assayTo evaluate clonogenic potential, transduced cells were counted and seeded (102 cells/cm2). Colonies were counted 7 days later. Only, colonies containing ≥ 30 cells were counted.ATP production measurementsATP production was measured with the ATPlite 1 step Luminescence Assay System (PerkinElmer) according to manufacturer's instructions. Glycolysis was inhibited by treatment with 5.5 mM 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose for 1 h.Spheroids formation assay15 × 102 cells/cm2 were seeded in a 96‐well plate containing 100 μl of 1.5% agar in PBS. Seventy‐two hours later, spheroids were harvested and collected in tubes filled with 1 ml of medium. Each tube contained five spheroids. Spheroids were let settle to the bottom of the tube, and medium was then sucked out. Spheroids were resuspended in 400 μl/well of a collagen mix solution (1.66 mM l‐glutamine, 10% FBS, 0.213% NaHCO3, 1% Pen/Strep, 2 mg/ml Collagen I Bovine Protein (Life Technologies) in MEM (Life Technologies)) and seeded in a 24‐well plate, previously filled with 300 μl/well of collagen mix solution. After collagen mix solidification, 1 ml of medium was added in each well. Images were collected every day, for 3 days, and the area of the spheroid cluster was analyzed by Fiji ImageJ software (time 0 as reference).RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative real‐time PCRRNA was extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was generated with a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) and analyzed by real‐time PCR (Bio‐Rad). HPRT‐1 and GAPDH were used as housekeeping genes. The following primers were used: HIF‐1α: FOR: TGTACCCTAACTAGCCGAGGAA_ REV: AATCAGCACCAAGCAGGTCATA HIF‐2α: FOR: AATGCAGTACCCAGACGGATTT_ REV: ATGTTTGTCATGGCACTGAAGC LOX: FOR: TCAGATTTCTTACCCAGCCGAC_ REV: TTGGCATCAAGCAGGTCATAGT PDK1: FOR: AATGCAAAATCACCAGGACAGC_ REV: ATTACCCAGCGTGACATGAACT G6PI: FOR: TTACTCCAAGAACCTGGTGACG_ REV: CTACCAGGATGGGTGTGTTTGA CAIX: FOR: TGGCTGCTGGTGACATCCTA_ REV: TTGGTTCCCCTTCTGTGCTG HK2: FOR: GTGCCCGCCAGAAGACATTA_ REV: TGCTCAGACCTCGCTCCATT HPRT‐1: FOR: TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA_ REV: GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT GAPDH: FOR: GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC_ REV: CCCCACTTGATTTTGGAGGGAT In vivo tumor assaysOne control and two independent MDA‐MB‐231 MCU −/− clones were transduced with a lentiviral vector coding for the Firefly Luciferase reporter gene (Breckpot et al, 2003).For orthotopic tumor assay, 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl DMEM and injected in the fat pad of six‐week‐old female SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). The volume of tumor mass was measured by calipering at specific time points. In vivo imaging was performed at the day of sacrifice (day 39 post‐injection for control, day 46 p.i. for MCU −/− clone1, and day 56 p.i. for MCU −/− clone2). D‐Luciferin (Biosynth AG) (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. to anesthetized animals. The light emitted from the bioluminescent tumors or metastasis was detected using a cooled charge‐coupled device camera mounted on a light‐tight specimen box (IVIS Lumina II Imaging System; Caliper Life Sciences). Regions of interest from displayed images were identified around metastatic regions, such as lymph nodes and lungs, and were quantified as total photon counts or photon/s using Living Image® software (Xenogen). In some experiments, the lower portion of each animal was shielded before reimaging in order to minimize the bioluminescence from primary tumor. For ex vivo imaging, D‐Luciferin (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. immediately before necropsy. The lungs were excised, placed in a Petri plate, and imaged for 5 min. Animals were randomized before experiments, and no blinding was done. Procedures involving animals and their care were in accordance with the Italian law D. L.vo no 26/2014, and the experimental protocol (Authorization n. 8584/2012‐PR) was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.Bioinformatics analysisTo evaluate the correlation of the expression of MCU complex components with tumor progression, median‐centered log2 mRNA expression levels of MCUa (NM_138357.2), MCUb (CCDC109b, NM_017918.4), MICU1 (NM_006077.3), MICU2 (NM_152726.2), MICU3 (NM_181723.2), and EMRE (SMDT1, NM_033318.4) were compiled from the TCGA breast cancer dataset (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/brca_2012/) (Koboldt et al, 2012). Linear regression analysis of individual expression values with the corresponding tumor size (T1–T4) and lymph node (N0–N3) stages was done in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc.).To quantify correlation of MCU mRNA levels with HIF‐1α and a HIF‐1α‐regulated gene set, linear models have been constructed in R, and prediction values were analyzed against MCU expression levels using linear regression analysis (GraphPad). The HIF‐1α‐regulated gene set was compiled from the Broad Institute GSEA database (merged sets of V$HIF1_Q3 and V$HIF1_Q5, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/cards/V$HIF1_Q5.html).Constructing linear models to predict correlations between MCU and HIF‐1α and a HIF‐1α‐regulated gene setTo test whether the expression of members of the MCU complex was predictive of HIF‐1α expression, two linear models were created. One to predict the expression of HIF‐1α from members of the MCU complex and the other to predict the average expression of HIF‐1α‐regulated genes. Both linear models were found to be highly statistically significant (P‐values 5.67e‐12 for predicting HIF‐1α and 2.48e‐22 for predicting HIF‐1α‐regulated genes), but these models predict only a relatively small amount of the variation in the data with adjusted R 2 values of 0.1099 and 0.1927, respectively. In both models, some members of the MCU complex were found to be more predictive than others. For instance, for predicting the expression of HIF‐1α, MCU is the most predictive with a P‐value of the expression of MCU not being relevant for predicting HIF‐1α was 3.83e‐06, while for predicting the average of HIF‐1α‐regulated genes, expression of MICU2 was most significant with a P‐value of 4.57e‐12. Output from R and detailed explanation can be found at http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html. The full set of results is summarized in the tables below:Linear model of MCU predicting HIF‐1α expression Linear model of MCU complex predicting HIF‐1α‐regulated gene expression StatisticsFor bioinformatics data, statistical analyses are reported above.For in vitro and in vivo experiments, statistical analyses were performed using Student's two‐tailed non‐paired t‐tests. P‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and marked with asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001), as indicated in the figure legends. Data are represented as mean ± SD if not indicated otherwise. Statistical tests applied are indicated in the figure legends.Sample size determinationFisher's exact test has been applied to determine the probability of detecting differences in the following end points: In vivo studies: a total number of nine mice for each experimental condition were analyzed in order to detect the expected variation in terms of probability of tumor growth and metastasis formation between treatment conditions, with statistical power of 0.85 and assuming a significance threshold corresponding to P < 0.05. A priori sample size determinations were performed by the GPower3.1 (www.gpower.hhu.de/) software tool and by a simulation based approach. In vitro studies: data available in our laboratory to define the variance of the results were adopted. We have assumed a statistical power of 85% and a significance level of P < 0.05 applying the Bonferroni correction whenever required."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Live Confocal Imaging of Brachypodium

In general, we try to accelerate the transition to flowering while still maintaining a healthy plant with several lateral branches. Using a ^20h light/4 h dark cycle and small pot sizes stimulates flowering, but in these conditions proper watering is important. Larger pot sizes and shorter day lengths will lengthen the time to flowering, but may yield more spikelets for imaging per plant.Plants can be grown at higher densities if they are only used for harvesting spikelets. If plants are grown for seeds, a lower planting density or culling before flowering is recommended. See the Materials and Reagents section for pot sizes and soil recommendations. Below you will find general growth guidelines.1.  Seed preparation (optional) For some batches of seed, germination can be improved by removing the lemma. The lemma is the outer leaf-like organ with a long protruding tendril-like mid-vein called the awn (Figure 3E). Peel off the lemma by gripping the awn and opening away from the seed.2.  SowingEnsure soil is well watered before sowing. Place 2 seeds per pot to ensure adequate germination. Plants will need to be culled down to 1 per pot if they are being grown for seed. Sow by pushing the seed vertically just below the soil surface with the awn end facing up.3.  Stratification (optional)After sowing place trays at 4^°C for 2-4 days to synchronize germination.4.  Growth Conditions20 h 300 umol light, 4h dark.5.  GerminationEnsure trays are well watered before placing into the light, and cover with clear plastic lids until plants are germinated, up to one week.6.  FertilizationInclude fertilizer with every second watering according to manufacturer’s instructions.Watering before floweringWatering is performed by pouring 1 cm of water into the bottom of each tray.Note: It is critical that young plants never sit in standing water for long periods of time, especially during the first 2-3 weeks of growth. If plants do not soak up the added water in the bottom of the tray after ~20 min it should be drained by pouring out. Use the weight of the tray to determine watering. In general, water sparingly during the first few weeks to stimulate root growth. Plants that are overwatered early will not have a well-developed root system and will suffer during flowering.# bio-protocol# 8.  Watering during flowering and seed setAfter flowering and especially during seed-set, plants will need plenty of water. After the first addition of water, allow plants to soak for 15-20 min before adding a small amount of additional water. At this stage, plants can sit in a small amount of water to ensure they do not dry out (e.g., over the weekend). Maintaining adequate watering late in development is critical to seed set. Watering can be cut off at the first sign of senescence (brown/yellowing starting in the inflorescence) to accelerate seed drying. Alternatively, watering can be extended during most of senescence to increase seed yield.# B.  StagingProper staging will ensure consistent results and facilitate dissection. In our growth conditions, Brachypodium has three main branching axes at floral transition. The central apical branch will generally flower first, and it is this branch that we focus on to harvest spikelet meristems. Upon the transition to flowering the apical meristem will first initiate several lateral spikelet (LS) meristems before transitioning into the terminal spikelet (TS) meristem (Figure 2A) (Derbyshire and Byrne, 2013; O'Connor et al., 2014). The terminal spikelet will mature first, followed by the lateral spikelets proceeding from the top of the inflorescence basally.Each spikelet meristem initiates two sterile leaf-like glumes (GL) before initiating florets in a distichous phyllotaxy ( 180^° between each organ) (Figure 2A). The first organ in each floret is the lemma (L), a leaf-like organ that subtends the floral meristem (FM) and will cover the seed at maturity (Figure 2B). At the tip of each lemma mid-vein is a long tendril called the awn (AW) (Figures 2A, 3E).()Figure 2. Brachypodium spikelet meristems. A. Maximum projection of Citrine (a YFP variant) tagged SoPIN1 auxin transport protein in the Brachypodium inflorescence. Normally with the# bio-protocolstaging method described in the text the terminal spikelet (TS) will not be exposed as in this image. The sterile glumes (GL), floral meristems (FM), lemmas (L), and awns (AW) of the terminal spikelet (TS) are labeled. The lateral spikelets (LS) are positioned perpendicular to the terminal spikelet and mature later. B. Maximum projection of SoPIN1 in a Brachypodium spikelet meristem. This side-on view is how we normally image. The youngest to oldest incipient lemma primordia are labeled I2 and I1, while youngest to oldest primordia are labeled P1, P2, and P3. The youngest floral meristem is also labeled (FM). C. The inflorescence can be turned 90 degrees to capture a view of the spikelet meristem where lemma primordia and the floral meristem are imaged end-on. In this maximum projection I1 convergent polarization of SoPIN1 (I1), the P2 lemma (P2), and the floral meristem (FM) are labeled. Scale bars =50~um in (A), 25um in (B) and (C).The key to staging is to identify branches where the floral transition has just occurred, but before the terminal spikelet fully emerges. This stage is easily identified because the awn of the terminal spikelet is visible emerging from the sheath of the last vegetative leaf (Figures 3B and 3C). At this stage the lateral spikelets will be immature and largely exposed. We have termed this stage the \"first-awn\" stage. The first-awn stage in the main axis occurs in our growth conditions starting approximately 3 weeks after moving plants to light, after the production of approximately 7 leaves. The earlier the first-awn stage is identified, the easier the lateral spikelets will be to dissect. It may be necessary to unroll the last vegetative leaf in order to see the first awn at the earliest stages (Figure 3B). Branches where the entire terminal spikelet has emerged from the last vegetative leaf (Figure 3D) are too old and are not suitable for harvesting spikelet meristems. At this late stage, the lateral spikelets are covered and tend to break off the main axis during dissection.We have not noticed significant differences between lateral and terminal spikelet meristems, but harvesting meristems from a consistent position is recommended.()Too young Perfect Last Chance Too old MatureFigure 3. Inflorescence staging. Stages of Brachypodium inflorescence development (A)-(E). A. Prior to the transition to flowering the inflorescence is not visible. B. The ideal stage for dissection is when the top of the terminal spikelet just emerges from the last vegetative leaf. The most identifying feature of the transition to flowering is the appearance of the awn, the tendril-like organ at the tip of each floret, clearly visible in panel E (labeled AW in B-E). Often the last vegetative leaf needs to be unrolled and opened slightly to reveal the terminal spikelet awn. Plants at this early “first-awn” stage are the easiest to dissect. C. The end of the ideal stage occurs when the terminal spikelet completely emerges from the last vegetative leaf. Panel C shows the very end of the permissible stage. Inset shows detail of the first awn of the terminal spikelet. D. Inflorescences where the terminal spikelet has fully emerged are not suitable for imaging. E. The mature Brachypodium inflorescence with the terminal spikelet (TS) and two lateral spikelets (LS). The mature lemmas (L) and awns (AW) are clearly visible at this stage.# C.  DissectionNote:a.  See Video 1 for a demonstration of the entire dissection procedure.b.  These steps should be completed as quickly as possible. The sample will dry out if the cut end is not embedded in agarose quickly. A damp paper towel can be placed on the stage of the dissection scope to delay sample drying. Recommended dissection tools are shown in Figure 1.1.  Identify branches at the \"first-awn\" stage (Figure 4A)2.  Remove the sample from the main plant by cutting just below the last visible node. Node tissue is generally white and is covered in a collar of trichomes, hereafter called the \"fuzzy collar\" (FC) (Figure 4A).3.  Release the internal tissues by cutting through the entire stem just above the fuzzy collar of the node (Figure 4B).4.  Gripping the base lightly with your fingers (do not crush), carefully pull the inner tissue out of the sheath tissue of the outer leaf.5.  Repeat until there is a single leaf surrounding the inflorescence. Usually, 2-3 leaves cover the immature inflorescence.()Video 1. Video of dissection and mounting of Brachypodium spikelet meristem. Video shows how to identify the first awn stage, dissect out the spikelet meristem sample, remove organs covering the meristem, and mount for confocal imaging.# bio-protocol6.  Once again, cut just above the fuzzy collar of the node (Figure 4C), carefully grip the leaf base with your fingers and pull out the inflorescence (Figure 4D).7.  Under the dissecting scope grip the sample by the terminal spikelet and select one of the lateral spikelets for dissection. Generally, the lowest lateral spikelet is the easiest to dissect.8.  Using a probe, syringe needle, or fine forceps start at the base of the spikelet and remove the immature bracts (Figure 4E) and any immature lemmas covering the spikelet meristem. Note: The immature bracts and lemmas wrap around the spikelet, so it is often easier to remove them if you insert the probe on the opposite side of the spikelet meristem from the midvein and unwrap. The organ will break at the base.9.  Remove immature organs until the spikelet meristem is visible (Figure 4F).10. For the last few lemmas that have not grown enough to cover the spikelet meristem, only the awns should be removed by gripping with forceps and bending away from the spikelet meristem apex until the awn breaks off. Note: If these awns are not removed a bubble will form around the spikelet meristem making staining and imaging under water impossible.11. The exposed spikelet meristem is now ready for optional staining or mounting (Figure 4G).()Figure 4. Dissection and mounting of spikelet meristems. A. First remove the sample by cutting below the fuzzy collar (FC) of the last visible node. B. Using micro-scissors or razorblade cut just above the fuzzy collar (FC) of the node to release the inner tissues. C. Once the# bio-protocolinner nodes are removed from the sheath by pulling out, repeat by carefully cutting just above the fuzzy collar (FC) of the next node. D. Repeat until the entire inflorescence is released by pulling on the end of the terminal spikelet (TS). The basal most lateral spikelets (arrows) are typically the easiest to dissect because they are less likely to break off, and the meristems are more exposed. E. Expose the meristem by removing the glume (GL) and lemma primordia wrapped around the spikelet meristem. F. Remove the remaining lemma awns (arrows) by carefully bending down and breaking off or by using the sharp end of a syringe needle to cut off. G. Once all lemmas and lemma awns are removed the meristem is fully exposed (arrow) and ready  for  mounting  or  optional  counterstaining.  H.  After  optional  counterstaining,  the inflorescence is trimmed and mounted in a Petri dish by adhering the ends with drops of 1% agarose. Immerse the sample in water to prevent drying and image immediately.# D.  Counterstains (optional)After dissection, samples can be counterstained by placing directly into a 1.5~ml microfuge tube containing the stain of choice (Figure 5A). Make sure a bubble does not surround the spikelet meristem and that it does not contact the side of the tube.We have successfully used propidium iodide to stain cell walls (Figures 5B and 5D, Propidium iodide: 10u/m l in water for 10-20 min ). Propidium iodide is normally excluded from the inside of the cell by the plasma membrane. Thus, damaged or dead cells will stain internally, especially in the nucleus, and damaged samples are easily identified.We also regularly use the vital stain FM4-64 to stain cell membranes and endocytic vesicles (Figure 5C, FM4-64 (Figure 5C): 50 u/m l in water for 5-15~m i n ). Short stain times (5-10 m i n) will mark only the cell membrane, while longer stain times will mark vesicles as the stain is endocytosed.()Figure 5. Counterstains. A. Samples can be carefully placed directly in staining solution in a microfuge tube. B. Medial confocal z-section of a propidium iodide stained spikelet meristem showing the cell walls. Lemma primordia are labeled from youngest to oldest I2, I1, P1, P2. Theyoungest floral meristem is also labeled (FM). C. Medial confocal z-section of an FM4-64 stained spikelet meristem showing primarily the cell membrane. Internalized stain is shown with an arrow. The asterisk marks the unstained floral meristem. Incipient lemma primordia are labeled from youngest to oldest I2 and I1, while primordia are labeled P1 and P2. The youngest floral meristem is labeled (FM). D. Medial confocal z-section co-localization of Citrine-tagged PIN1b and propidium iodide stained cell walls. Left PIN1b, middle propidium iodide, and right merged image. Note the reduced staining of propidium iodide deep in the center of the spikelet (asterisk); this tissue is both hard to stain and image because of the thickness of the tissue. Lemma primordia are labeled from youngest to oldest I2, I1, P1, P2, P3. Floral meristems are labeled (FM). Scale bars =25 um in (B) and (C), 50um in (D).# E.  Mounting1.  Once the target spikelet meristem is revealed, you can cut off the other spikelets so the sample will lie flat in the dish. Note: Be sure to leave enough tissue at both ends to act as mounting points (Figure 4H).2.  Using molten 1% agarose and a Pasteur pipette, \"glue\" the two ends of the sample down in the center of a 5 cm Petri dish (Figure 4H).3.  Working quickly before the agarose solidifies, adjust the sample so the target meristem sits in the plane of the dish. This may involve twisting the main branch axes quite severely.4.  After the agarose completely solidifies cover with water and image immediately, do not allow the sample to dry out.# F.  ImagingImaging parameters will depend on the specific reporter, sample, confocal, objective, and other factors, but general recommendations are provided here.Most confocals will have settings to automatically optimize XY and Z resolutions. These are a good starting point, but these settings often oversample for most experiments and lead to long scan times and possible bleaching. For routine moderately-high resolution imaging, we use around 1024 ×1024 resolution and a field of view of 200um or less. Lower resolutions around 512×512 may be suitable for some experiments and will greatly increase the scanning speed. We recommend a bit depth of at least 12, especially if quantifying florescence. We generally use a zoom of approximately z x with a 20× objective and a Z step-size of 0.5-3~um with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit, although these settings should be adjusted to the particular sample and experimental goal.Because the spikelet meristem is symmetrical, only one half of the depth needs to be imaged in order to get a good sense of a particular expression domain. The sample can be turned 90^° , remounted with agarose and re-imaged to get a different view (Figures 2B and 2C). The relatively small size of the Brachypodium spikelet meristem means it is generally easy to image deep into the tissue. However, the fluorescent signal will decrease deeper into the tissue, especially at the base of the spikelet meristem (Figure 5D).\nGrowth\nIntroduction\nBrachypodium plants can be grown in a variety of soils, pots, temperatures, and light regimes.\nThe goal is to accelerate the transition to flowering while maintaining a healthy plant with several lateral branches.\nSeed Preparation\nFor some batches of seed, germination can be improved by removing the lemma.\nPeel off the lemma by gripping the awn and opening away from the seed.\nSowing\nEnsure soil is well watered before sowing.\nPlace 2 seeds per pot to ensure adequate germination.\nSow by pushing the seed vertically just below the soil surface with the awn end facing up.\nStratification\nAfter sowing, place trays at 4°C for 2-4 days to synchronize germination.\nGrowth Conditions\n20h 300 umol light, 4h dark.\nEnsure trays are well watered before placing into the light, and cover with clear plastic lids until plants are germinated, up to one week.\nFertilization\nInclude fertilizer with every second watering according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nWatering\nWatering is performed by pouring 1 cm of water into the bottom of each tray.\nNote: It is critical that young plants never sit in standing water for long periods of time, especially during the first 2-3 weeks of growth.\nStaging\nIntroduction\nProper staging will ensure consistent results and facilitate dissection.\nIn our growth conditions, Brachypodium has three main branching axes at floral transition.\nIdentifying the First-Awn Stage\nThe key to staging is to identify branches where the floral transition has just occurred, but before the terminal spikelet fully emerges.\nThis stage is easily identified because the awn of the terminal spikelet is visible emerging from the sheath of the last vegetative leaf.\nDissection\nIntroduction\nSee Video 1 for a demonstration of the entire dissection procedure.\nThese steps should be completed as quickly as possible.\nRemoving the Sample\nIdentify branches at the 'first-awn' stage.\nRemove the sample from the main plant by cutting just below the last visible node.\nReleasing Internal Tissues\nRelease the internal tissues by cutting through the entire stem just above the fuzzy collar of the node.\nGripping the base lightly with your fingers, carefully pull the inner tissue out of the sheath tissue of the outer leaf.\nExposing the Meristem\nRepeat the process until there is a single leaf surrounding the inflorescence.\nOnce again, cut just above the fuzzy collar of the node, carefully grip the leaf base with your fingers and pull out the inflorescence.\nDissecting the Spikelet Meristem\nUnder the dissecting scope, grip the sample by the terminal spikelet and select one of the lateral spikelets for dissection.\nUsing a probe, syringe needle, or fine forceps, start at the base of the spikelet and remove the immature bracts and any immature lemmas covering the spikelet meristem.\nCounterstains\nIntroduction\nAfter dissection, samples can be counterstained by placing directly into a 1.5ml microfuge tube containing the stain of choice.\nPropidium Iodide Staining\nPropidium iodide can be used to stain cell walls.\nPropidium iodide is normally excluded from the inside of the cell by the plasma membrane.\nFM4-64 Staining\nFM4-64 can be used to stain cell membranes and endocytic vesicles.\nShort stain times will mark only the cell membrane, while longer stain times will mark vesicles as the stain is endocytosed.\nMounting\nIntroduction\nOnce the target spikelet meristem is revealed, you can cut off the other spikelets so the sample will lie flat in the dish.\nMounting the Sample\nUsing molten 1% agarose and a Pasteur pipette, 'glue' the two ends of the sample down in the center of a 5cm Petri dish.\nWorking quickly before the agarose solidifies, adjust the sample so the target meristem sits in the plane of the dish.\nImaging\nIntroduction\nImaging parameters will depend on the specific reporter, sample, confocal, objective, and other factors.\nGeneral Recommendations\nMost confocals will have settings to automatically optimize XY and Z resolutions.\nFor routine moderately-high resolution imaging, we use around 1024 ×1024 resolution and a field of view of 200um or less."}, "consistency": {"doi_match": false, "title_sim": 0.0, "keyword_sim": 0.002, "action_overlap": 0.143, "material_overlap": 0.25, "param_coverage": 0.25, "section_list": ["Materials and Methods"], "sections_total_chars": 20151, "sections_total_tokens": 2847, "suspect_mismatch": false, "notes": ""}}

Specifically, 25 ml cultures were grown in round-bottom Pyrex tubes (20 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter). Cotton-plugged Pasteur pipette (23 cm long) inserted through a sponge-plug served for bubbling of 3% CO2 in air into the cultures. The tip of the Pasteur pipette was placed 1–2 cm above the bottom of the tube. Prior to bubbling into the culture, the gas was humidified by passing through a bottle with double distilled water and filtered using 0.22 μm filter. BG11 medium45 served for culturing; however, to reproducibly observe biofilm formation, it was important to add the ferric ammonium citrate and citric acid components (final concentrations 0.0226 and 0.0312 mM, respectively) from freshly made stocks. Autoclaved BG11 was used within 4 days to inoculate cultures. Cultures were grown at 30 °C and under incandescent light (20–30 μmol photons m−2 sec−1).For assessment of biofilm formation, cells were cultured under continuous bubbling. Experiments were initiated by diluting cultures at the exponential phase of growth to an optical density at 750 nm of 0.5. Biofilm development under this setting typically initiated following 2–3 days of growth and quantification was performed after 7 days to allow assessment of fully developed biofilms (longer growth time did not increase biofilm development). Percentage of chlorophyll in suspended cells served to quantity biofilm formation as follows. The suspended fraction was sampled for chlorophyll determination by extraction in 80% acetone (final concentration). In cases were the suspended fraction appeared especially dense (planktonic strains or poor biofilm formers), a 0.2 mL sample was used for extraction. When robust biofilms were formed, 15 mL of planktonic cells were removed and concentrated 3 to 6-fold by centrifugation (5000 g, 10 min) prior the chlorophyll extraction in 80% acetone. Determination of chlorophyll in the biofilm was performed following removal of the planktonic cells using a pipette and addition of 80% acetone to the sessile cells. Extraction was carried out over-night in the refrigerator. Dilution in 80% acetone was performed to reach the linear range of the calibration curve and chlorophyll was quantified based on absorbance at 663 nm. For statistical analysis of comparisons of chlorophyll in suspension we employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post analysis multiple comparison contrasts (see statistical grouping in Figs 2 and 4 and Tables S1 and S3 for p-values).For collection of conditioned medium, cultures were centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed and passed through a 0.22 μm filter. Supplementation with nutrients by addition of medium stock solutions as in the preparation of fresh growth medium was performed when the conditioned medium served for cyanobacterial growth.For microscopic analysis of biofilms, microscope slides were inserted into growth tubes containing T2SEΩ cultures (for 6 days) so that biofilms formed on the slides. A Leica TCS SPE DM2500 was employed for imaging by fluorescence microscopy using objective HCX APO l 40x/0.80 (excitation 532 nm, emission 620–650 nm). 3D image reconstruction was performed using Imaris. Analysis by SEM was described previously33.Genetic manipulations of cyanobacterial cellsInsertional inactivation of genes Synpcc7942_2071 (t2sE), Synpcc7942_1134 (ebfG4), and Synpcc7942_1133 was described previously33. In the case of deletion of ebfG1 through ebfG4 (∆4), disruption was obtained by deletion of the fragment between the NheI and ClaI sites. Resulting constructs were introduced into S. elongatus using standard transformation methods that take advantage of its natural competence46. Mutant cyanobacterial clones resistant to the appropriate antibiotic were confirmed for double homologous recombination (allele replacement) and complete chromosomal segregation using PCR on genomic DNA. Primers and additional cloning information are provided in Table S4. Inactivation of t2SE impaired the natural DNA competence of S. elongatus; thus, to obtain T2SEΩ strains with additional genetic changes, we initially introduced the other genetic modifications and subsequently inactivated t2sE.Vectors used to introduce the WT and mutated complementation DNA fragments into NS1 were generated using the GeneArt® Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Life Technologies) on PCR-generated cloning fragments and standardized devices (a chloramphenicol resistance device and a NS1 device with tetracycline resistance) derived via ZraI or EcoRV-HF (New England Biolabs) restriction digestion of CYANO-VECTOR donor plasmids as described by Taton et al.47. To improve the efficiency of cloning, the 6-kb WT DNA fragment was constructed from two 3-kb fragments amplified with the Q5® High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). To introduce glycine- or cysteine to alanine mutations, the appropriate cloning fragment was assembled from subfragments; these segments were generated using seamless assembly cloning primers designed to introduce the appropriate base mutations at the center of the overlap between subfragments. Combining multiple such subfragments or generating subfragments from previously mutated vectors allowed the generation of the quadruple GG-mutation vector. The sequence of each vector was confirmed. These vectors were used to transform S. elongatus strains as described above. For additional information see Table S4 and Fig. S2.Mass spectrometry analysisConditioned medium was harvested as described above. Mass spectrometry was performed by the de Botton Institute for Protein Profiling at The Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalized Medicine (Weizmann Institute of Science).Sample preparationCulture supernatants were concentrated ~20 fold on 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff-filters. Proteins were reduced by incubation with dithiothreitol (5 mM; Sigma) for 45 min at 60 °C, and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark for 45 min at 21 °C. Proteins were then subjected to digestion with trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI, USA, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 4 h at 37 °C followed by digestion with chymotrypsin (Sigma, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestions were stopped by trifluroacetic acid (1%). Following digestion, peptides were desalted using solid-phase extraction columns (Oasis HLB, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The samples were stored in −80 °C until further analysis.Liquid chromatographyULC/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi nanoAcquity; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase C18 trapping column (180 μm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 μm particle size; Waters). The peptides were then separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 μm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 μm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 μL/min. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 4% to 30% B in A (vol/vol) in 105 min, 35% to 90% B in A in 5 min, maintained at 95% for 5 min and then back to initial conditions.Mass SpectrometryThe nano Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 μm tip; New Objective; Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon). For initial identification, data were acquired in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top20 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time was set to 20 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500 and maximum injection time of 60 msec. For targeted analysis, data was acquired in Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) mode, monitoring previously identified peptides from EbfG1-4. MS2 resolution was set to 35,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time of 100 msec.Data processing and analysisFor identification purposes, raw data was first processed using Proteome Discoverer v1.41. MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot v2.4 (Matrix Sciences) and Sequest HT. Data were searched against the S. elongatus protein database as downloaded from UniprotKB (http://www.uniprot.org/), appended with EbfG1-4, along with 125 common laboratory contaminant proteins. Fixed modification was set to carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modification was set to oxidation of methionines. Search results were then imported back to Expressions to annotate identified peaks. Proteins were then grouped based on shared peptides and Identifications were filtered such that the global false discovery rate was maximum of 1%. For PRM analysis, raw data and DDA search results were imported into the Skyline software (https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/). The software was used for retention time alignment, peak detection of peptide fragments and their quantification.Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric test, because the majority of the data (or any viable transformation of it) are not normally distributed.RNA preparation and RT-PCRRNA was prepared as previously described48 and treated with DNase (TURBO DNase, Ambion). Random hexamers (Promega) were used to prime cDNA using 1.5 μg RNA and reverse transcriptase (RevertAid, Fermentas). PCR amplification was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with addition of betaine pH 9.0 (final concentration of 0.525M) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Melting curve analysis was performed (65 to 95 °C, 0.5 °C/5s) to confirm amplification of a single cDNA sequence for each gene. Primer dimers or unexpected amplicons were not observed. No signals were detected in the negative controls (samples in which reverse transcriptase was not added). Specific primers for RT-qPCR and RT-PCR of the ebfG1-4 transcript are indicated in Table S4. Transcript levels of psbC, encoding CP43, a chlorophyll binding protein of photosystem II, served to normalize total RNA levels.For statistical analysis we employed three factor ANOVA to calculate the covariance (normality and equality of variances were tested using Kruskal-Wallis & Levene’s tests respectively, both found to be >0.05). Next, we used multiple comparison contrasts to evaluate the differences of each pair of comparison. In each bar graph in Fig. 3a, different letters assign statistical significance (see Table S2 for p-values)."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Preparation of Precisely Oriented Cryosections of Undistorted Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs for High Resolution Confocal Imaging", "keywords": " Cryosection, Frozen sections, Confocal microscopy, Wing imaginal disc, Drosophila Background Third instar imaginal discs are flat pocket-like involutions of the epidermis (Cohen, 1993; McClure and Schubiger, 2005). One layer of this pocket, the ‘disc proper’, is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that is heavily folded at the onset of metamorphosis. It is continuous with the ‘overlaying’ squamous epithelium, the peripodial membrane. The focus of our work is to understand how the Wnt morphogen patterns the dome-shaped wing pouch region of the wing disc. As imaginal discs are flat overall, conventional imaging has them mounted for top-down or upside-down observation, whereby cover-slips compress and distort the folded structure. The use of spacers prevents distortions, but imaging of the entire wing pouch using Z-stacks has proved unsatisfactory or impossible; as outlined above, the reduced resolution in the Z-axis typically prevents high-resolution reconstruction of the epithelium in the apical/basal direction. Therefore, only the apical half of the epithelium of the wing pouch is detected at high resolution. This problem is exacerbated if weak signals are to be detected. Thus, uniform imaging requires a ‘side-view’ that can be obtained in sections. We modified a cryosection protocol (Culbertson et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2012) to obtain transverse sections of wing discs at defined angles.

Post-fix in Solution A for 1 h at room temperature.7.  Wash 3x with PBT each for 10m i n .B.  Embedding in gelatin1.  In a glass 9-well plate, add 300~ul of 50~^°C of Solution D (gelatin, see Recipes) to each well. Ensure that the surface of the solution is level and free of bubbles2.  Place on ice for 30 min to allow the gel to solidify. Note: Try to prevent condensation from forming on glass 9-well plate, as falling droplets might dilute the gelatin solution and interfere with gelation.3.  Under the dissection microscope: Gently remove the wing discs from carcasses in PBT.4.  Using a pipette, transfer the wing discs into a well of Solution C (sucrose, see Recipes) and incubate for about 60 min at room temperature.5.  Transfer a single wing disc by pipette (in about 20~ul of liquid) from the sucrose solution onto the solidified gelatin (Figure 2A). Note: The disc should be placed directly into the middle of the well.6.  Remove as much excess liquid as possible, ensuring that the disc is lying flat on the gel (Figure 2B).7.  Apply an additional 300ul of 50~^°C Solution D (gelatin) on top of the wing disc (Figure 2C).()Figure 2. Schematic representation of the gelatin embedding process. A. Transfer a wing disc to the gelatin by pipette. B. Remove excess sucrose solution from around the disc. C. Add an addition 300ul of gelatin on top of the disc.# bio-protocol8.  Place on ice and allow the gel to solidify about 30 min.9.  Under a dissecting microscope, use a razor blade to cut the gelatin into a block around the sample.Note: This should be done with regard to the desired orientation of the cryosection. For example, if cross-sections are desired across the wing pouch dorso-ventrally, one face of the gel block should be perpendicular to the dorsoventral boundary (Figures 3A and 3C).()Figure 3. Orientation of wing discs in cut gelatin cubes. Wing disc stained with DAB to visualize expression of Wingless & Patched, for illustration, in trimmed gelatin blocks. A. Topdown view of a wing disc in gelatin cube. The red line indicates the face of the cube which should be placed face-down into the embedding capsule to acquire a dorsoventrally aligned section.

Place the gel cube with the desired face down onto the lid of a plastic embedding capsule (Figures 3B and 4C).()Figure 4. Preparation of plastic embedding capsule. A. Plastic embedding capsule (Step B8 above). B. Cut the conical tip off from the capsule using a razor blade (the arrow indicates movement of the blade). Discard the conical tip. C. Place the sample with the desired cutting face downward onto the lid of the capsule (red cube, indicated by arrow). D. Close the capsule and fill from the top with tissue freezing medium (arrow indicates where to add medium).12. Gently fill the capsule with tissue freezing medium, allowing large air bubbles to escape (Figure 4D).13. Place capsule immediately into dry ice or a -80~^°C freezer.# C.  Cryosectioning1.  Remove the frozen sample from the plastic embedding capsule. This is achieved by first removing the lid, then cutting away the remainder of the plastic capsule with a razor blade.2.  Affix the sample to a cold (-80~textdegreeC) microtome sample holder using tissue freezing medium (Figures 5A-5B).3.  With the cryostat chamber set to -24~^°C , place the holder in the microtome (Figure 5C).4.  Cut sections of 10-20 um thickness. The anti-roll plate ensures a flat section comes off the knife (Video 1).5.  Pick up tissue sections by gently touching a glass microscope slide to them. Create a row of sections (Video 1).6.  Check under a fluorescence microscope for the presence of disc tissue in gelatin slices, and mark their location on the back of the slide.7.  Add Fluoromount- G^scriptscriptstyle(perp) atop the samples.8.  Place a coverslip over the slide, seal with nail polish.()Figure 5. Preparing samples for cryosectioning. A.

(Hudson, NY). Phenotyping assays were conducted in homozygous null and compound heterozygous animals of multiple combinations of confirmed null alleles. The single copy number of the Bglap gene was demonstrated in the presence of only two bands in HMAs of heterozygous animals and of only one band in the homozygous wild-type and null mutant animals. Additionally, following genotyping, all null mutant animals had total loss of protein by serum ELISA, western blot and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2D–F). All procedures using the rat (Rattus norvegicus) in this project were conducted with the approval of the IACUC and the UAB Animal Resources Program (ARP), with only the requested number of animals needed for completion of the project. The ARP has been accredited by AAALAC since 1971. UAB is registered as a research institution with the USDA and is in full compliance with the NIH policy on animal welfare as filed with the Office for Protection from Research Risks on April 16, 1979, and reaffirmed on April 1, 1990 (#A3255-01).CRISPR sgRNA design and synthesisCRISPR guide RNAs were designed using the MIT Server to target exons 1 and 2 in the rat osteocalcin locus. Rbglap-CRISPR1 (Exon 1, reverse strand) was 5′-CAGAGAGGCAGAATGCAGTCAGG-3′; Rbglap-CRISPR2 (Exon 2, reverse strand) was 5′-TTTGTCAGACTCAGAGTCGCTGG-3′ [nucleotides in italics represent the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), the sequence required for CRISPR/Cas9 targeting]. Annealed oligonucleotides encoding the guideRNA were cloned into a plasmid vector (Hwang et al., 2013) and confirmed by sequencing. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were generated using the Ampliscribe T7 RNA transcription kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) and purified. Cas9 mRNA was in vitro transcribed using the pCS2-nCas9n plasmid (gift of Wenbiao Chen, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, USA; Jao et al., 2013) and SP6 in vitro transcription kit (CellScript Inc., Madison, WI). The final concentration of Cas9 mRNA and CRISPR sgRNA in the injection solution were 25 ng µl−1 and 50 ng µl−1, respectively.GonadotropinsFemale Sprague-Dawley rat embryo donors from 3 weeks of age to adulthood were administered 20 IU of PMSG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 3 days prior to the day taken as conception followed by 30 IU of HCG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) 2 days later to induce superovulation. At 5 days prior to the day taken as conception recipient Sprague-Dawley female rats over 8 weeks of age were administered 40 IU of LHRHa (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to synchronize estrous cycles. Donor and recipient females were mated to stud and vasectomized Sprague Dawley males, respectively, on one day prior to the day taken as conception.Collection of embryosAt day 0.5 post-conception, the synchronized donor female was humanely sacrificed using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. The animal was placed in dorsal recumbency and the abdomen was liberally scrubbed with betadine. The abdomen was carefully opened to expose the abdominal cavity and the uterine horns were sequentially grasped carefully with blunt forceps to allow tracing to the corresponding ovary. The oviduct was isolated, excised, and flushed with sterile medium to expose the cumulus masses containing fertilized embryos. Embryos were cultured in KSOM (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) prior to microinjection.MicroinjectionFertilized embryos were placed in M2 medium (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and covered in embryo-tested mineral oil on a Leitz/Leica Laborlux S Nomarski DIC microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The CRISPR/Cas9 solution was injected directly into the pronuclei using an injection needle and holding pipette controlled by micromanipulators.Embryo transferInstruments were sterilized by bead sterilization for 5 s. Anesthesia was induced in the recipient rat by placement in a chamber with 1.0–1.5 l min−1 of 5% isoflurane with oxygen as a carrier gas and maintained during surgery with 3% isoflurane by placement of the nose of the pre-anesthetized rat in a nose cone after subcutaneous injection of 0.10 ml of 0.3 mg ml−1 buprenorphine (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Richmond, VA) and 0.2 ml of 5 mg ml−1carprofen (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). The lower back of the recipient rat was shaved above the left uterine horn, and placed on a sterile tissue on the stage of the microscope. The oviduct was exposed through an incision in the abdominal wall. The manipulated embryos were then injected into the oviduct by gentle pressure through the pipette into the ostium of the oviduct. The reproductive tract was then carefully replaced in the abdomen, the abdomen was closed using suture in the body wall, and the skin was closed with a single wound clip. Post-surgical analgesics were provided [subcutaneous injection 0.2 ml carprofen (5 mg ml−1) after 24 h].Animal identificationAnimals were identified by cage card, sex and through unique ‘ear tags’ consecutively numbered that were affixed at weaning.BiopsiesTail biopsies were performed when animals were weaned. A 5–7 mm portion of the distal segment of the tail was cut and the remainder cauterized for analysis. Genomic DNA was purified from the lysed tail samples.Identification of foundersFounder animals were identified by PCR using primers flanking the target loci that amplified a 601-bp fragment in wild-type animals (Rnbglap-genF1, 5′-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3′; Rnbglap-genR1, 5′-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3′). Positive samples were confirmed by modified Sanger sequencing. Heteroduplex formation of amplified fragments was facilitated by denaturing the PCR samples at 95°C for 10 min and slowly cooling the samples to 4°C over ∼20 min to enable renaturation. The re-annealed samples, which included homoduplexes and heteroduplexes, were run on 6% polyacrylamide-TBE gels at 100 V for 45 min before staining with ethidium bromide to visualize bands under UV light. Samples showing heteroduplex mobility shifts were cloned into a plasmid vector (pCR 2.1) using the TOPO-TA kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Recombinant plasmids with inserts were isolated and subjected to Sanger sequencing to obtain sequence information of modified alleles.Genotyping procedureThe following PCR primer sets were used to identify the indel alleles found in F0, F1 and F2 animals: Rnbglap-genF1, 5′-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3′ and Rnbglap-genR1, 5′-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3′ (601 bp); Rnbglap-genF2, 5′-AAGTCCCACACAGCAACTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genR2, 5′-CGGAGTCTATTCACCACCTTAC-3′ (474 bp); and Rnbglap-genR3, 5′-CTCTCTGGTAGTTTGTCCCTTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genF3, 5′-CACAGCATCCTTTGGGTTTG-3 (329 bp).Western blottingTissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold T-PER lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a protease inhibitor tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). For immunoblotting, protein was loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and separated by electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at 100 V for 50 min, and crosslinked using 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight with a monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves, et al. (2013)] diluted 1:2500 at 4°C, followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG secondary antibody. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical analyses of osteocalcin was performed as previously described (Cook et al., 2013). Briefly, excised femurs were submerged in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for fixation before decalcification with 10% EDTA and paraffin embedment. 5-μm-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded decalcified femoral tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed and boiled for 20 min in a diluted (1:30), pH 9.0 antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were incubated in a horse serum blocking solution (ImmPRESS system, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h followed by incubation with monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves et al. (2013)] in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibody (ImmPRESS, Vector Laboratories) was applied and slides were incubated in DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate solution (Dako). Each slide was then incubated with Harris hematoxylin counterstain (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells positive for osteocalcin stained brown.DXAIn vivo body composition of the rats was assessed using the GE Lunar Prodigy DXA with Small Animal Software (GE, Madison, WI; v.6.10) as previously described and validated (Moreau et al., 2001; Bertin et al., 1998). The rats were anesthetized with a constant flow of 4% isoflurane in oxygen. They were then placed in a prostrated position on the DXA and scanned using the Small Animal Software (v.6.10). Each scan took ∼5 min and the resulting data were analyzed by drawing a region of interest that included the entire rat. Data obtained from this scan included total body fat mass, lean mass, BMD and BMC.Insulin tolerance test and glucose tolerance testRats were fasted for 4 h prior to the ITT conducted in the afternoon and overnight prior to the GTT conducted in the morning. After the fast, the rats were weighed and placed in a clear restraint tube which allowed easy access to the tail for blood sampling. The tip of the tail (1 mm) was cut with a scalpel for the baseline sample. Blood was collected from this same point throughout the test, without needing to cut the tail again. Approximately 2 µl of blood per read was analyzed for glucose content using the Alphatrak analyzer and strips (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). Insulin or glucose was injected into the peritoneal cavity after the baseline glucose measurement and blood glucose was measured at the following time points post injection: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min. Doses of insulin and glucose were dependent on the glucose status of the animals and were 0.75 IU kg−1 and 1.50 mg g−1, respectively.µCTWild-type littermates and osteocalcin-null rats of 5 months of age were sacrificed and their femurs were dissected. Excised rat femurs were scanned using the Scanco µCT40 desktop cone-beam µCT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). The femur was placed inverted in a 20-mm diameter scanning holder and scanned at the following settings: 20-mm resolution, 70 kVp and 114 µA with an integration time of 200 ms. Scans were automatically reconstructed into 2D slices and all slices were analyzed using the µCT Evaluation Program (v.6.5-2, Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). For the cortical analysis, the bone was scanned at the midshaft of the bone for a scan of 50 slices. The region of interest (ROI) was drawn on every slice and fitted to the outside of the cortical bone, to include all the bone and marrow. The threshold for cortical bone was set at 316 (grayscale value). The 3D reconstruction was performed using all of the outlined slices. Data were obtained on bone volume (BV), total volume (TV), BV/TV, bone density and cortical thickness. An additional analysis was performed using the software to measure the periosteal circumference using the same outlines. For the analysis of endosteal circumferences, a new ROI was drawn and fitted to the inside of the cortical bone. The same analysis was then performed as for the periosteal circumference. For the trabecular bone, the scan was started distal to the growth plate and consisted of 312 slices. The region of interest started at the point on the scan where the condyles ended. From this point, 200 slices were outlined on the inside of the cortical bone, enclosing only the trabecular bone and marrow. Trabecular bone was thresholded at 211 (grayscale value) and the 3D analysis performed on the 200 slices. Data were obtained on trabecular bone volume, total volume, thickness, density, separation and number.Biomechanical strength testingThree-point bending tests were completed using an MTS 858 MiniBionix (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) equipped with a 15,000 N load cell (calibrated to 1500 N). Upon killing, the femurs were harvested, cleaned of soft tissues, wrapped in saline-moistened gauze and frozen until use. The bones were placed onto a custom three-point bending apparatus such that primary loading occurs in the posterior to anterior direction. The rate of deformation was established (typically 0.1–0.5 mm s−1), and data recorded with a sampling rate of 100 Hz using MTS Basic Testware (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN) with parameters being time, axial force and deflection. These data were imported into Excel for analysis and the maximum force, maximum bending moment, stiffness (the slope of the force-displacement curve), and energy to maximum force (area under the force–displacement curve from the point of contact to the point of maximum force) were calculated.Collection of serumWhole blood was collected into 1.5 ml tubes at the time of killing by cardiac puncture with a 26 gauge needle. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 min. Serum was collected into 1.5 ml tubes and stored at −20°C.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayA sandwich-type EIA Rat Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Nojihigashi, Japan; cat. no. MK147) was used according to manufacturer instructions to measure osteocalcin in serum from osteocalcin-null and wild-type male rats.Statistical analysesOutcomes were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) by two-tailed parametric unpaired t-tests with a 95% confidence level or a s.e.m., or as the area under the curve, with one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA as appropriate. P≤0.05 was considered significant. Outliers were determined by Grubb's outlier test (a=0.05) and excluded from analyses."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Formalin Murine Model of Pain", "keywords": " Pain, Nociception, Inflammation, Analgesia, Mice Background The formalin test is an experimental assay that permits determining mice nocifensive behaviour. Thus, the mice response (i.e., licking and flinching) is assessed after a subcutaneous injection of formalin normally in the plantar hind paw (Tjolsen et al., 1992). The test was originally described in the late seventies (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977), and, initially, it consisted of the injection of 50~ul of 5% formalin in the dorsal surface of one forepaw of a rat or a cat. Since then, the formalin test has been extensively used to assess nociception and inflammation-related responses, thus being adapted according to each study’s aim. Mice and rats are frequently used due to their innate grooming behaviour (i.e., forepaw licking). Accordingly, a 2.5% formalin (in physiological saline solution) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the rodent hind paw is commonly used to induce nociceptive responses (i.e., paw ‘flinching’ and licking) lasting for 45-90 min (Tjolsen et al., 1992).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2628", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Habituation"}, "1.1": "Individually expose the animals to be tested to the observational chamber for 1h, one day before the experiment.", "2": {"title": "Reagents Preparation"}, "2.1": "Prepare the 2.5% formalin solution and the drug to be tested on the day of the experiment.", "2.2": "Clean all the material needed.", "3": {"title": "Weighing Animals"}, "3.1": "Remove the mouse from the house cage and measure its body weight using a weighing machine.", "4": {"title": "Administration of the Analgesic Drug"}, "4.1": "Administer the analgesic drug to be tested intraperitoneally using an insulin syringe.", "4.2": "Adjust the amount of drug to be administered according to the dose to be tested and the mouse body weight.", "4.3": "Ensure all animal experimentation is carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments.", "5": {"title": "Acclimation"}, "5.1": "Place the animal in the observational chamber for 20 min before recording formalin administration.", "5.2": "Optionally, place a colored plastic surface below the observational chamber for contrasting the animal's hair.", "6": {"title": "Formalin Loading"}, "6.1": "Load 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution directly into the 0.3m insulin syringe equipped with a 30 G needle.", "6.2": "Alternatively, take the 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution with a 2-20ul micropipette, place it in a 100ul Eppendorf tube, and then load the insulin syringe.", "7": {"title": "Formalin Administration"}, "7.1": "Take the animal from the observational cage and place it carefully inside the restrain module with the selected hind paw exposed outside.", "7.2": "Inject slowly the 20ul of 2.5% formalin solution into the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw using the insulin syringe.", "7.3": "Ensure the needle is placed in between toes and ankle and inserted beneath the surface of the skin to avoid tissue damage.", "8": {"title": "Phase I (0-5 min)"}, "8.1": "Return the injected animal to its observational chamber and set the timer for 5 min.", "8.2": "Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period.", "8.3": "Annotate the result and switch on and off the recording system if used.", "9": {"title": "Quiescent Period (5-15 min)"}, "9.1": "Stop the timer and leave the animal without disturbing it for 10 min.", "10": {"title": "Phase II (15-30 min)"}, "10.1": "Set the timer for 15 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase II.", "10.2": "Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period.", "10.3": "Annotate the result.", "11": {"title": "Finishing"}, "11.1": "Return the animal to its home cage.", "11.2": "Check whether the animal needs any special attention or health care.", "12": {"title": "Cleaning"}, "12.1": "Clean all the material used.", "12.2": "Repeat the experiment with another animal if required and visualize the videos to measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during each period."}, "text_flat": "Formalin Murine Model of Pain\n\n1.

HabituationOne day before the experiment, the animals to be tested are individually exposed to the observational chamber (Figure 1a) for 1h .2.  Reagents preparationThe day of the experiment, prepare the 2.5% formalin solution (see Recipes) (Figure 1b) and the drug to be tested (not shown). Clean all the material needed.3.  Weighing animalsRemove the mouse from the house cage and measure its body weight using a weighing machine (Figure 1c).4.  Administration of the analgesic drugAdminister (i.e., intraperitoneally, i.p.) the analgesic drug to be tested (i.e., raseglurant; Figure 2) or the same volume of vehicle (physiological saline solution) using an insulin syringe (Figure 1d).Note: The amount (400-500 μl) of drug to be administered should be adjusted according to the dose to be tested (i.e., 10 mg/kg of raseglurant) and the mouse body weight (20-25~g) . For example, for a mouse of _20g of weight we will administer (i.p.) 400 μl of a 500 mg/L raseglurant solution in saline. In addition, all animal experimentation should be carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments.5.  AcclimationThe animal is placed in the observational chamber for 20 min before recording formalin administration (Figure 2).Note: A coloured plastic surface (i.e., black) could be placed below the observational chamber for contrasting the animal’s hair (i.e., CD-1 mice have white hair) (Figure 1e).()Figure 2. Treatment schedule depicting the administration regimen of drug, formalin and the behavioural testing (phase I and II)6.  Formalin loadingLoad 20~ul of 2.5% formalin solution directly in the 0.3m insulin syringe equipped with a 30 G needle.Note: Optionally, the 20 µl of 2.5% formalin solution could be taken with a 2-20 µl micropipette, placed in a 100 µl Eppendorf tube and then load the insulin syringe with.# 7.  Formalin administrationTake the animal from the observational cage and place it carefully inside the restrain module (Figure 1f) with the selected (i.e., right) hind paw exposed outside (Figure 3A). Inject slowly the 20~ul of 2.5% formalin solution using the insulin syringe in the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw (Figure 3B).Notes:a.  The needle should be placed in between toes and ankle and inserted beneath the surface of the skin, thus any tissue damage should be avoided.b.  The injection should be done firmly and time-optimized. Animals could perceive the restrain as stressor stimulus and that can increase the variability of the results.()Figure 3. Hind paw of a restrained mouse (A) and administration of formalin solution (B)# 8.  Phase I (0-5 min)Return the injected animal to its observational chamber. Set the timer for 5 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase I (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (5 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.Notes:a.  If a recording system is used, switch on and off the system accordingly. b.  We strongly recommend the investigator to perform some training at this step to familiarize themselves with the licking/biting behavior.9.  Quiescent period (5-15m i n) )Stop the timer and leave the animal without disturbing it for 10 min (Figure 2).10. Phase II (15-30 min)Set the timer for 15 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase II (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (15 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.# 11. FinishingReturn the animal to its home cage.Note: If a recording system is used switch off the camera. Check whether the animal needs any special attention or health care (i.e., bleeding, extra tissue damage, etc.).# 12. CleaningClean all the material used.Note: Repeat the experiment with another animal if required. If a camera is used, visualize the videos and measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during each period (phase I and II) (Video 1).()Video 1.

The pfat-7::GFP (rtIs30) carrying strain HA1842 was a kind gift from Amy Walker [31], and its quantification was performed as previously described [10]. C. elegans strains maintenance and experiments were performed at 20°C using the E. coli strain OP50 as food source, which was maintained on LB plates kept at 4°C (re-streaked every 6–8 weeks) and single colonies were picked for overnight cultivation at 37°C in LB medium then used to seed NGM plates [56]; new LB plates were streaked every 3–4 months from OP50 stocks kept frozen at -80°C.Plates with supplementsStock solutions of supplements (1M glucose, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and lactate; 5 M NaCl and KCl; 50 mM fluvastatin) were filter sterilized then added to cooled NGM after autoclaving; 100 mM paraquat, 30 mM FCCP (in ethanol), pure DMSO and pure glycerol were used without sterilization.Seeding of NGM plates with E. coli mutantsThe Keio collection of E. coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockouts was used as source of E. coli mutants and kept in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin [15]. Mutants were picked as single colonies from LB plates and cultivated overnight at 37°C in LB then seeded onto NGM plates with or without additives. All mutants were confirmed by PCR.MacConkey agar assayE. coli strains were streaked onto MacConkey agar plates with 0.4% glucose, grown at 37°C over night and scored for colony color.Growth and tail tip scoring assaysFor length measurement studies, synchronized L1s were plated onto test plates seeded with E. coli, and worms were mounted then photographed 96 hour (oleic acid rescue experiments) or 72 hours (all other experiments) later. The length of >20 worms was measured using ImageJ [57]. Quantification of the withered tail tip phenotype was done on synchronous 1-day old adult populations, i.e. 72 h post L1 (n≥100) [10].Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)FRAP experiments in C. elegans were carried out using a membrane-associated prenylated GFP reporter expressed in intestinal cells, as previously described and using a Zeiss LSM700inv laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion objective [11,58]. Briefly, the GFP-positive membranes were photobleached over a circular (7 pixel radius) using 20 iterations of the 488 nm laser with 50% laser power transmission. Images were collected at a 12-bit intensity resolution over 256x256 pixels (digital zoom 4X) using a pixel dwell time of 1.58 μsec, and were all acquired under identical settings. For FRAP in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were stained with BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 (4,4-Difluoro-5-Methyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3-Dodecanoic Acid) (Invitrogen) at 2 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min at 37°C. FRAP images were acquired with an LSM880 confocal microscope equipped with a live cell chamber (set at 37°C and 5% CO2) and ZEN software (Zeiss) with a 40X water immersion objective. Cells were excited with a 488 nm laser and the emission between 493 and 589 nm recorded. Images were acquired with 16 bits image depth and 256x256 resolution using a pixel dwell of ~ 1.34 μs. Ten pre-bleaching images were collected and then the region of interest was beached with 50% of laser power. The recovery of fluorescence was traced for 25 seconds. Fluorescence recovery and Thalf were calculated as previously described [11].Pre-loading of E. coli with fatty acidsStocks of 0.1 M palmitic acid or 0.5 M oleic acid dissolved in ethanol were diluted in LB media to final concentrations of 0.25–2 mM, inoculated with OP50 bacteria, then shaken overnight at 37°C. The bacteria were then washed twice with M9 to remove fatty acids and growth media, diluted to equal OD600, concentrated 10X by centrifugation, dissolved in M9 and seeded onto NGM plates lacking peptone (200μl/plate). Worms were added the following day.LipidomicsFor worm lipidomics, samples were composed of synchronized L4 larvae (one 9 cm diameter plate/sample) grown overnight on OP50-seeded NGM, NGM containing 20mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate, or plates lacking peptone but seeded with fatty acid-supplemented bacteria. Worms were washed 3 times with M9, pelleted and stored at -80°C until analysis. For bacterial lipidomics, E. coli liquid cultures grown overnight at 37°C were seeded on NGM, NGM containing 20 mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate or concentrated (as described above) and seeded on plates lacking peptone for lipid-supplemented cultures, kept upside-down at 20°C then washed off 96 h later using pure water, pelleted then frozen at -80°C until analysis. For HEK293 lipidomics, cells were cultivated in serum-free media with or without fatty acids for 24 h prior to harvesting using TrypLE Express (Gibco). For lipid extraction, the pellet was sonicated for 10 minutes in methanol and then extracted according to published methods [59]. Internal standards were added during the extraction. Lipid extracts were evaporated and reconstituted in chloroform:methanol [1:2] with 5 mM ammonium acetate. This solution was infused directly (shotgun approach) into a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrophotometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a Nanomate Triversa (Advion Bioscience, Ithaca, NY) as described previously [60]. Phospholipids were measured using multiple precursor ion scanning [61,62]. Ceramides from HEK293 cells were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry according to previous publication [63]. The data was evaluated using the LipidView software (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The complete lipidomics dataset is provided in the supplementary S1 File.Cultivation of HEK293HEK293 were grown in DMEM containing glucose 1 g/l, pyruvate and GlutaMAX and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, HEPES 10 mM and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) at 37°C in a water humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were sub-cultured twice a week at 90% confluence. Cells were cultivated on treated plastic flask and multi-dish plates (Nunc). For FRAP experiments, HEK293 were seeded in glass bottom dishes (Ibidi) pre-coated with 0.1% porcine gelatin (Sigma).siRNA in HEK293 cellsThe following pre-designed siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon: AdipoR1 J-007800-10-005 (set 1) and J-007800-09-0002 (set 2), AdipoR2 J-007801-10-0005 (set 1) and J-007801-09-0002 (set 2), GAPDH D-001830-10-05, Non-target D-001810-01-05 or D-001810-10-05, and SCD J-005061-07-0005. Transfection of 25 nM siRNA was performed in complete media using Viromer Blue according to the manufacturer’s instructions 1X (Lipocalyx). Knockdown gene expression was verified 48 h after transfection.Quantitative PCR in HEK293 cellsTotal cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific). cDNA was obtained using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem) with random hexamers. qPCR were performed with a CFX Connect thermal cycler (Bio Rad) using Hot FIREpol EvaGreen qPCR SuperMix (Solis Biodyne) and standard primers. Samples were measured as triplicates. The relative expression of each gene was calculated according to the ΔΔCT method [64]. Expression of the housekeeping gene PPIA was used to normalize for variations in RNA input. Primers used were: AdipoR1-For (CCATCTGCTTGGTTTCGTGC) and -Rev (AGACGGTGTGAAAGAGCCAG), AdipoR2-For (TCATCTGTGTGCTGGGCATT) and -Rev (CTATCTGCCCTATGGTGGCG), GAPDH-For (GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT) and -Rev (TAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAGG), PPIA-For (GTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAG) and -Rev (GGACAAGATGCCAGGACCC), and SCD-For (TTCGTTGCCACTTTCTTGCG) and -Rev (TGGTGGTAGTTGTGGAAGCC).HEK293 fatty acid and FCCP treatmentPA and OA were dissolved in sterile DMSO (Sigma) then mixed with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in serum-free medium for 20 min at room temperature. The molecular ratio of BSA to fatty acid was 1 to 5.3 (except in the experiment using using 200 μM PA in which case the ratio was 1 to 2.65). Cells were then cultivated in this serum-free media containing the fatty acids for 24 h prior to analysis, and with 400 μM PA or OA being used unless stated otherwise. FCCP was dissolved in ethanol to produce a 30 mM stock and used at a concentration of 10 μM in serum-free-media for 4 hours prior to analysis.StatisticsError bars for worm length measurements show the standard error of the mean, and t-tests were used to identify significant differences between worm lengths. SFA/MUFA ratios were normalized using a logN conversion prior to test for significance using a t-test. Error bars for the frequency of the tail tip defect show the 95% confidence interval and significant differences determined using Z-tests. t-tests were also used to determine significance in FRAP experiments, and the lipidomics data in HEK293 cells was analyzed using ANOVA and a Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. All experiments were repeated several times with similar results.

The ERG is a useful tool for measuring retinal responses in mice due to its high level of sensitivity and noninvasive nature, and can be utilized to assess eye disease and retinal degeneration (Duncan et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Vollrath et al., 2015). In mouse genetic retinal disease models, ERGs can be used to assess retinal degeneration at multiple time points as the disease progresses (Duncan et al., 2003). For studies evaluating the effect of drug treatment on the mouse eye, retinal function can be assessed before and after treatment in the same eye (Zhao et al., 2011). In the following protocol, we describe a method for measuring the functional response of photoreceptors and downstream retinal cells in mice that builds on a previously published approach (Phillips et al., 2010).

Day before experiment1.  Place mice in a light-proof dark room and allow them to dark-adapt overnight. a.  Check with your institution on regulations regarding overnight housing of animals. b.  A lux meter can be used to assess if the room is light-proof.2.  Warm the non-electric heat pad in a 37^°C bath or incubator overnight.B.  Prepping for the experiment1.  Set up the dark room a.  Existing light sources can be used if covered with red filter to make them procedure-safe. b.  Cover the computer monitor and any miscellaneous lights with red filter or black electrical tape. c.  Cover the 37~^°C heat pad with an absorbent pad. Position the elevated platform with heat pad on top so that the mouse can be easily prepared and moved into the dome. Note: The heat pad may need to be reheated to 37^°C if multiple animals are tested.2.  Move mice to experimental dark room if different from overnight adaption room. This can be done using either a blackout cloth or light-proof box. Mice that are not being tested should be kept in a dark environment.3.  Set stimulus settings as described below.# C.  Preparing the miceNote: From this point on, only red-filtered light sources should be used in order to keep mice darkadapted.1.  Anesthetize the mouse by injection of ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine hydrochloride (80 m g/k g/13 m g/k g) , and allow mice to become fully sedated (2-5m i n) ). Check for a toe-pinch response to ensure the animal is adequately anesthetized.2.  Treat both eyes with 1% atropine sulfate, 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, and 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride, allowing drops to sit on the eyes for 2 min before wicking with a cotton swab and applying the next drop. After this point the eyes should be kept hydrated with a hydrating eye ointment until the contact lens electrodes are applied (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Anesthetized mouse with atropine sulfate, phenylephrine hydrochloride, proparacaine hydrochloride, and hydrating eye drops3.  Position the mouse on the heated platform. Place the ground needle electrode in the base of the tail, and reference needle electrode subdermally between the eyes (Figure 2). a.  Forceps can be used to lift the skin between the eyes for a more controlled insertion.()Figure 2. Electrode placement on the mouse4.  Wick any excess moisture from the eyes, and add a small drop of 2.5% hypromellose to each eye.5.  Use fingers or forceps to position the contact lens electrodes onto the corneas. The hypromellose should keep the lenses in place. It may be helpful to tape down the electrode wires to the pad using surgical tape so they do not shift during the experiment (Figure 3, Video 1).()Figure 3. Contact lens electrodes on the mouse eyeVideo 1. Applying the contact lens electrodes to the mouse eye()6.  Slide the heated platform into the dome so that the mouse’s eyes are inside of the dome (Figures 4 and 5).()Figure 4. Mouse with electrodes on the heated, elevated platform()# Figure 5. Mouse with eyes inside of the Ganzfeld ColorDome7.  Before beginning and throughout the scotopic and photopic assays, periodically check that impedance levels are acceptably low (within the green range). A low impedance level indicates that the electrodes have been properly installed.Note: The impedance may be high if any of the electrodes have shifted and the circuit has been broken. The Espion visual electrophysiology system displays impedance using green, yellow and red bars to signify the level of resistance in the circuit.D.  Running the scotopic (dark-adapted) ERG1.  Settings to record scotopic ERGs()2.  Start with the following settings5 trials/step Pulse frequency: 0.2Hz Sample frequency: 1,000 Hz Trial pre-trigger time: 20 msec Trial post-trigger time: 250 msec3.  Run through each step of light intensity using the Espion E2 system. Note: Check the impedance every 2-3 steps or as needed to ensure that the electrode circuit has not been broken.E.  Running the photopic (light-adapted) ERG1.  Light adapt the mouse for at least 10 min at a light intensity of 20 cd s e c/m^2 . Light adaptation saturates the rod response so that the cones, which account for only 3% of the photoreceptor population in the mouse eye, can be stimulated and recorded without rod interference (Fu, 2010).Note: It may be necessary to give the mouse a second, reduced dose of ketamine/xylazine if the animal begins to wake up.2.

Start with the following settings:25 trials/step Pulse frequency: 1.0Hz Sample frequency: 1,000 Hz Trial pre-trigger time: 20 msec Trial post-trigger time: 250 msec4.  Run through each step of light intensity using the Espion E2 system.F.  Post-experiment1.  Remove electrodes from the mouse and gently clean contact electrodes with a cotton swab and water. Needle electrodes can be wiped with 70% ethanol.2.  Place mouse in a clean cage on top of a heat pad until it recovers. Keep the mouse’s eyes moist with a hydrating eye ointment (Figure 6).()Figure 6.

Forward and reverse primer pairs were designed to amplify the respective open reading frame in full. Forward primers contained a ribosomal binding site (RBS), optionally a Kozak sequence, a T7 promoter, a 6× His epitope tag sequence, and a transcript-specific portion. Reverse primers were made of the V5 epitope sequence and a transcript-specific sequence; the presence of a T7 terminator sequence was found to be unnecessary. The Kozak sequence, which is important for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, was not added, if prokaryotic cell lysates were used for protein expression. Primers that were attached to solid support had a (dT)10 stretch at their 5′-ends, which acted as a linker. Attachment to the epoxysilane-coated microarray surface occurred via an amino-group, which was chemically added during synthesis to the 5′-end as part of a C6-linker. The fluorescent Cy5- or Cy3-label of oligonucleotides used for hybridisation was added during chemical synthesis. The actual oligonucleotide sequences are provided as Supplementary Materials information.Primer attachmentPrimer oligonucleotides were diluted to a concentration of 5 μM in 150 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.001% Tween 20. A volume of 1.5 nl was placed onto epoxysilane-coated slides (Nexterion E; Schott, Jena, Germany) using a NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-system (Gesim, Großerkmannsdorf, Germany). Printed slides were kept at room temperature and 70% humidity for 24 h and stored dry for a minimum of two days before being used. Prior to the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction, the slides were blocked in superblock buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. The slides were washed three times in distilled water and spin dried in a swing-wing centrifuge.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was extracted from the respective biological material (tumour, chronic pancreatitis and healthy pancreatic tissues as well as the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca-2) using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by absorption measurement on a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany). The RNA was stored at −80 °C or used immediately for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was produced from 1 μg of total RNA by means of the Protoscript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. One tenth of the product was used for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction.On-chip polymerase elongation reactionAn adhesive gene frame (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was fixed onto the microarray and filled with 25 μl of 1x Qiagen LongRange PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 100 ng DNA and 1 U LongRange PCR polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primer extension was done in a 16 × 16 dual-block PTC 200 thermocycler (BioRad, Munich, Germany) by initial heating to 93 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 93 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and a final elongation step at 68 °C for 10 min. The microarrays were extensively washed with water to remove the PCR cocktail and dried using pressurised air.Detection of on-chip DNA-products by oligonucleotide hybridisationFluorescently (Cy3 or Cy5) labelled oligonucleotides were diluted to 1 μM in 3× SSC (450 mM NaCl, 45 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.1% SDS. After 10 min at 95 °C, hybridisation was at 60 °C overnight. The microarrays were subsequently washed in 3× SSC supplemented with 0.1% SDS, then in 3× SSC and finally in 0.3× SSC for 10 min each. The arrays were briefly rinsed with water and dried with pressurised air. The signal intensities were detected on a Power Scanner (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).Detection of on-chip DNA-products by PCR in solutionThe microarrays were extensively washed with water and dried. Adhesive gene frames (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed on the microarrays and filled in with 1x Qiagen PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). However, no DNA template was added but for the DNA present on the microarray spots. The amplification reaction was performed as described for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction. The PCR-products in the supernatant were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. As a negative control, spots were used on which there was no DNA-template.In situ cell-free protein expressionFor protein expression, slides with PCR-products were washed twice in 1xSSC for 5 min and dried. Multiple spotting (MIST) was used for in situ cell-free expression as described in detail before11. In short, the slides were placed into the NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-element system (Gesim) in the same orientation they had been during primer spotting. First, 0.6 nl of 0.5 M betaine was spotted onto the position of each PCR-product, followed by 2.1 nl of S30 T7 High-Yield Protein Expression System (Promega, Madison, USA). In a humidified chamber, the slides were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently at 30 °C overnight. After washing, the microarrays were stored at −20 °C for a minimum of 24 h before use. Usually, we use a density of about 2,000 proteins per slide of 7 × 2 cm. At higher densities, there is a higher risk that the individual droplets, in which the reactions take place, may get in contact, thus causing contamination. However, spot density can be adapted to the respective requirements.Protein detectionSypro Ruby stainingFor a quick determination of overall array quality, protein microarrays were incubated with Sypro Ruby staining solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting luminescence signal is equivalent to the amount of protein present at each location.Antibody detectionFor a more detailed analysis, expressed proteins were detected with directly fluorescence-labelled antibodies that recognise the N-terminal 6xHis epitope (Penta-His Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate; Qiagen) or the C-terminal V5 epitope (monoclonal anti-V5-Cy3; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). In addition, protein-specific monoclonal antibodies were used (e.g., anti-CDK2, clone AN4.3 and anti-P53, clone DO-1; Sigma-Aldrich). The microarrays were blocked with 2% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (137 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 10.0 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.76 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min. Blocking with 2% BSA was required so as to cover the regions in between protein spots, since otherwise the labelled antibodies would bind preferentially to these areas. There was very little unspecific binding to the actual protein spots even without blocking, but the blocking does not harm specific binding events. After washing the arrays surface in PBST three times, antibody incubation was in PBST, 2% BSA at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 1 h. While 0.1 μg/ml binder was used for epitope tag detection, protein-specific antibodies had a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. For detection of the latter, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and incubated with a 1:10.000 dilution of fluorescent dye conjugated secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Cy5-conjugated antibody; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) for another hour. Finally, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and air-dried in a ventilated oven.DARPin targetsTarget proteins were enzymatically biotinylated using the ImmunoProbe Biotinylation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation of 5 μg/ml biotinylated protein on the DARPin array, detection was performed with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-Etravidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h.Data acquisition and analysisFor signal detection, microarrays were scanned on a Power Scanner (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). In all measurements, the instrument’s laser power and photomultiplier tube were adjusted to avoid signal saturation. The scanner settings were kept identical for all arrays of an experimental series. Relevant parameters, such as concordance of the two colour detection channels, were carefully validated throughout. Spot segmentation was performed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Union City, USA). The mean local background intensity was subtracted from the mean signal intensity for each spot to obtain background-corrected signal intensities. Data were analysed using the linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) package20 of R-Bioconductor. For normalisation, a specialised invariant Lowess method was applied21."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Assessment of TCR-induced Sumoylation of PKC-θ", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1979", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Cell Preparation and Cell Culture"}, "1.1": {"title": "Blood Dilution and Ficoll Layering"}, "1.1.1": "Dilute 500ml blood with 500ml HBSS.", "1.1.2": "Carefully layer 35ml of diluted blood over 15ml of Ficoll in a 50ml conical tube.", "1.2": {"title": "Centrifugation and Mononuclear Cell Layer Separation"}, "1.2.1": "Centrifuge at 350×g for 40 minutes at 25°C in a swinging-bucket rotor without brake.", "1.2.2": "Aspirate the upper layer leaving the mononuclear cell layer undisturbed.", "1.3": {"title": "Mononuclear Cell Layer Transfer and Washing"}, "1.3.1": "Carefully transfer the mononuclear cell layer to a new 50ml conical tube.", "1.3.2": "Fill the tube with HBSS, mix, and centrifuge at 300xg for 10 minutes at 25°C.", "1.4": {"title": "Cell Pellet Resuspension and Centrifugation"}, "1.4.1": "Carefully remove supernatant.

The selected TSC patients were reported with mental retardation and seizures along with other TSC-related abnormalities. iPSC reprogramming was done based on polycistronic construct with OCT3/4, c-MYC, SOX2, and KLF4 (Warlich et al., 2011). All the iPSC lines were cultured in Essential 8 medium (Gibco) on Geltrex LDEV-free (Gibco). Generation of in-direct contact iPSC-neuronal mono-cultures was performed as described earlier (Nadadhur et al., 2017) with slight modifications. Neuronal mono-cultures with a density of 62.5 K/2.0 cm2 in the Std condition medium contained Neurobasal composition with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (20 ng/mL; Peprotech) and cAMP (1 μM; Sigma). The Std + IGF-1 and Std + Rapa conditions contained Std medium with IGF-1 (10 ng/mL; Peprotech) or Rapa (30 nM; Sigma), respectively. For detailed culturing methods and culture conditions for MEA experiments please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Glial Cells and Co-culturesOLs were obtained as described previously (Izrael et al., 2007). Before neuron-OL co-cultures were generated, we first separately created neuron mono-cultures (62.5 K/2.0 cm2 density) until day 37 (Nadadhur et al., 2017) and OL progenitors until day 65. To generate neuron-OL co-cultures, the neuronal coverslips were removed from rat astrocyte feeder plates and OL progenitors were passaged with Accutase (Millipore) and plated at a density of 200 K/2.0 cm2 on neuronal coverslips. The co-cultures were maintained in Std co-culture medium (DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal [1:1; both Gibco], 1% N1 supplement [in-house], 2% B27 supplement [Gibco], 1% NEAA [Gibco], 60 ng/mL T3 [Sigma], 100 ng/mL Biotin [Sigma] medium with NT3 [10 ng/mL; Peprotech], mouse laminin [1 μg/mL; Sigma], BDNF [20 ng/mL], and cAMP [1 μM]). From day 1 to 7 of co-culture, all cells were refreshed with Std medium. From day 8 to 28 of co-culture, cells were refreshed with either Std, Std + Guana (5 μM; Sigma) or Std + Rapa (10 nM) medium twice a week. At day 28 of co-culture, the cell culture coverslips were processed for immunocytochemistry.Calcium ImagingAt day 56, neuronal mono-culture coverslips were incubated with Fluo-5-AM ester 1 μM in Neurobasal medium without growth factors for 5 min at 37°C and imaged under constant perfusion at 0.5 mL/min rate with Tyrode's solution (119 NaCl. 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 30 glucose; all in mM) in an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× oil objective (numerical aperture 1.3; Zeiss), a Polychrome IV light source (TILL Photonics), a 488/6 nm excitation filter (Semrock), a 525/50-nm emission filter (Semrock), and a 500-nm beam splitter (Semrock). Images (1 image/s) were acquired using a Cascade 512 EM-CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and Metamorph 6.2 software (Molecular Devices). The total length of 4.5 min was recorded per FOV, and a minimum of five FOVs per coverslip was recorded each from two to four differentiations for three controls and three TSC lines. For analysis, image series were stacked using z stack projection in ImageJ, and regions of interest were placed on a minimum of 12 neurites per FOV. Calcium traces were detected using “event detection analysis (EVA)” with previously described methods in MATLAB (Hjorth et al., 2016).MEA60MEA200/30iR-Tigr MEAs were used. Spontaneous activity was recorded, for a period of 10 min, every 10 days at 37°C using MC Rack at a sample rate of 25,000 Hz. Electrode data were filtered online with a 200 Hz high pass and a 5,000 Hz low pass filter (both second-order Butterworth). Data were stored as .mcd files, which contain the filtered continuous traces for each electrode together with the spikes detected using the online threshold detection built into MC Rack. After selecting electrodes for analysis, chosen data were converted to asci files for offline analysis using the MC Data tool. Offline analysis was achieved with custom scripts written in MATLAB. Spikes were detected from filtered data using an automatic threshold-based method set at −5.5×σ, where σ is an estimate of the noise of each electrode. Spike timestamps were analyzed to provide statistics on the general excitability of cultures. The average spike rate (Hz) represents the median of the average spike rate for all electrodes (AvgSpkRateE1-n). The average spike rate for each electrode (AvgSpkRateE) was calculated as AvgSpkRateE = number of spikes/tmax, where tmax is the total length of the recording in seconds. This is used to control for particularly high or low firing rates.ImmunofluorescenceFor immunocytochemistry, neuronal mono-cultures and neuron-OL co-culture coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min and processed for staining. For immunohistochemistry, slides were washed with PBS (6 times for 5 min each in PBS 1×), optionally treated for 2 min with citrate buffer (0.01 M [pH 6]) for antigen retrieval, followed by washing in PBS (5 min for 1 time). All the coverslips/slides were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in blocking buffer (5% NGS, 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS 1×), incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Next day, after washing again with PBS (6 times for 5 min each), the coverslips/slides were incubated with secondary antibody solution for 2 hr, washed again (6× for 5 min), and then mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) on glass slides (VWR; Super frost plus)/glass coverslips. Images were acquired from stained slides using either a Carl Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope with 40× (1.2 numerical aperture) oil objective or a Leica DM6000B fluorescent microscope with 10×, 20×, and 40× magnification. For details of primary antibodies used please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Cell Property AnalysisCell properties such as axonal density, dendritic density, soma size, and the number of synapses; OLIG2- and MBP-positive cells were measured using Columbus 2.5 online software. Precisely, images acquired with confocal and fluorescent microscope were analyzed with algorithms for morphology, soma recognition, and co-localization tools using pixel density measurement and the number of objects present, respectively. To quantify the soma sizes and morphological parameters, pixel densities were measured in each FOV (6–10 per condition/coverslip) with images of 20× or 40× magnification. To quantify dendritic branching, the NeurophologyJ tool was used in ImageJ.Western Blot AnalysisCell lysates were collected from feeder-free iPSCs at day 3 or 4 after passage and from neuroepithelial stem cells between P1 and P5. SDS-PAGE was run on Bolt 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween, followed by primary antibody incubations at 1:1,000 concentration in 5% BSA in TBS-0.05% Tween and incubated ON at 4°C (primary antibodies are listed in Supplement Information). The blots were then washed thrice for 10 min with TBS-Tween and incubated with secondary antibody in milk-TBS-Tween for 1 hr at RT. After washing thrice again, bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific) on Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR). Primary antibodies against TSC1 (no. 6935) and TSC2 (no. 4308; both from Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1,000 concentrations. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase rabbit antibody (1:1,000; no. 7074S, Cell Signaling Technology).Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 software. All the raw data were tested for normal distribution and then analyzed using unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA, depending on group numbers. In cases where significant differences were obtained in the ANOVA (p < 0.05), a Tukey's post hoc test was performed."}}, "protocol": {"title": "Extraction and Quantification of Tryptophan and Kynurenine from Cultured Cells and Media Using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System Equipped with an Ultra-sensitive Diode Array Detector", "keywords": "", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1781", "hierarchical_protocol": {"1": {"title": "Tryptophan and Kynurenine Extraction Overview"}, "1.1": "The protocol requires a minimum of 1×10^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels.", "1.2": "If tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect 2 mL of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80°C.", "2": {"title": "Cell Collection and Media Preparation"}, "2.1": "If cells of interest are adherent cells, proceed to step A2a.

The protocol requires a minimum of 1×10^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels. If tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect _2 m of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80^°C . This sample will be used to measure the baseline levels of tryptophan and kynurenine in the media.2.  If cells of interest are adherent cells, then proceed to step A2a. If cells of interest are suspension cells, then proceed to step A2b. If desired, the cell culture can be spiked with an internal standard such as 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (a final concentration of 20-50~uM is generally appropriate) at this time. The internal standard can be used to quantify metabolite recovery.a.  At the completion of the treatment schedule, collect 2 ml media in _2~scriptsize~m~ microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000xg at 4~^°C in centrifuge to pellet cells/debris from the media. Without disturbing the pellet, transfer media into two labeled tubes of equal volume. One will be used for immediate analysis while the other will serve as a backup. At this point, cell-free, centrifuged culture media can be stored at -80~^°C until analysis. Media can be analyzed by HPLC without the need for extraction. Next, aspirate off remaining media in plate/flask where cells are grown. Wash cells with cold (4~^°C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Afterwards, dislodge cells from culture plate/flask by scraping. Collect liberated cells and place into _2m l microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 xg at 4^°C in centrifuge. Proceed to step A3.b.  At the completion of the treatment schedule, collect all media containing cells into appropriate volume conical tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g at 4^°C in centrifuge to pellet cells/debris from media. Without disturbing the pellet, transfer 1~ml of media into two labeled tubes. One will be used for immediate analysis while the other willserve as a backup. At this point, cell-free, centrifuged culture media can be stored at -80~^°C until analysis. Media can be analyzed by HPLC without the need for extraction. Next, wash pelleted cells with cold (4~^°C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Proceed to step A3.3.  Centrifuge cells at 2,000× g at 4^°C and aspirate PBS without disturbing the cell pellet. Keep cells on ice while pipetting PBS. To quench metabolism and extract metabolites, add 200ul ice-cold 50% methanol 150% PIPES-EDTA to the cell pellet.4.  To the quenched cell mixture, add 200ul ice-cold chloroform and vortex vigorously for45 min at -20 °0 . (Note: This extraction length is important when extracting metabolites from organisms with cell walls including bacteria and yeast. A shorter extraction time of 5-10 min is adequate for mammalian cells. Vigorous vortexing is most effective for metabolite extraction. Use of a multi-tube vortex mixer head is recommended.) Afterwards, centrifuge at 21000× g at 4^°C for 10m i n .5.  Collect upper, water/methanol phase in a clean labeled tube. This is the first metabolite extract. Place tube on ice.6.  Re-extract the chloroform phase by adding 200~ul of ice-cold 50% methanol/ 50% PIPES-EDTA. Vortex for 1 min and centrifuge again at 21, 100xg at 4^°C for 10m i n .7.  Just as before collect the upper, water/methanol with the extract from step A5. Freeze the extract until analysis.B.  Detection and quantification of tryptophan and kynurenine1.  Analyze metabolites from cell culture media and from cell extracts by HPLC. To separate and quantify tryptophan and kynurenine, inject 5-20~uI (Note: The required injection volume will vary depending on the concentration of metabolite in the sample and is a recommended range.) of the cell extract obtained from step A7, spent culture media collected in step A2, or the cell-free media collected from step A1 in an HPLC equipped with an ultra-sensitive diode array detector and a Hypersil GOLD C18 column ^50×2.1 m m, 3um ), which is a reverse phase column packed with spherical, fully porous ultrapure silica. Set column temperature to be maintained at 30~^°C . Use an isocratic mobile phase of 15~m M potassium phosphate (p H6.4) , with 2.7% (v/v) acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0.8m l/m i n . The run time should be set for 10 min.2.  Quantify the area under the peaks that display absorbance at 286 nm and 360~n m to calculate the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine, respectively, in the samples. Generate standard curves ranging from 0 to 200~uM for both tryptophan andkynurenine and other metabolites of interest as well as any internal standard (if applicable) using authentic standards. Standards of each concentration should be prepared in triplicate and measured in triplicate. A recipe for a standard mix is included in the Recipes section.# bio-protocolNote: Details of standard curve generation will vary depending on the chromatography system and data analysis software used. Consult the manufacturer’s documentation to generate a standard curve with your instrument’s software.\nTryptophan and Kynurenine Extraction Overview\nThe protocol requires a minimum of 1×10^6 cells to accurately detect tryptophan and kynurenine levels.\nIf tryptophan and kynurenine quantification is desired from fresh media, collect 2 mL of fresh media prior to cell addition for subsequent analysis and freeze at -80°C.\nCell Collection and Media Preparation\nIf cells of interest are adherent cells, proceed to step A2a.

All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma.Cloning of the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAcDNAs (Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN were synthesized from the GenScript company (the N gene is replaced with gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP)). PCR was conducted to amplify fragments A, B, C, D and E using high fidelity PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara). T7 promoter was introduced upstream of 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genome in fragment A. To guarantee a seamless assembly of the full-length cDNA, type IIS restriction endonuclease sites (BsaI or BsmBI) were introduced at both ends of PCR fragments. The primers used for the PCR assay were listed in S1 Table.Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAPCR fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) to get specific sticky end. Digested fragments are purified by E.Z.N.A gel extraction kit (Omega). Fragment A, B are ligated first by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in 40μl system. At the same time, fragments C, D, E are also ligated in another tube at 4°C for 24 hours. Then, fragment A, B and C, D, E are combined together added with 2μl T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2μl T4 DNA ligase to 100μl at 4°C for another 24 hours. At the end of ligation, we took 5μl product to run an agarose gel to check the efficiency of ligation. Full-length assembly cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, isopropanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10μL nuclease-free water.

Twenty micrograms of viral RNA and 20μg N mRNA were mixed and added to a 4-mm cuvette containing 0.4 mL of Caco-2-N cells (8×106) in Opti-MEM. Single electrical pulse was given with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with setting of 270V at 950μF. GFP signal can be observed 17 hours post electroporation. Three days post electroporation, P0 virus was collected and Caco-2-N cells were infected with P0 virus to amplify virus.Lentivirus packagingVesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced by transient cotransfection of the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog number 12260; Addgene) and the transfer vector pLVX by VigoFect DNA transfection reagent (Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection. Supernatants were collected at 36, 60 and 84 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C refrigerator.RNA isolation and RT-qPCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo, 15596018). To analyze the RNA level of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. In brief, 1μg total RNA was reverse transcribed using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-101) to produce cDNA with random primers. Reactions of qPCR were carried out using the 2×RealStar Green Power Mixture (Genstar, A311) according to the instruction. The qPCR primers for viral RNA were as follows: THU-2190 (5’- CGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCC-3’) and THU-2191 (5’- TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3’). The sequences of the qPCR primers for GAPDH was described previously[44]. Relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. All data were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.RNA-seq and data analysisTotal RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The rRNAs were removed by using Ribo-Zero Gold module of Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA library prep kit (RS-122-2201) and then cDNA libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq was performed by using the Illumina Novaseq platform. The reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947) was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore /MN908947. After removing low-quality reads, remaining Illumina sequence reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) and SARS2 genome by using HISAT2.1.0 with parameters:—rna-strandness RF–dta. RNA-seq coverage was visualized by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). To quantify the expression levels of SARS2 genes, RPKM of each virus genes and GFP gene were calculated. Heatmaps were drawn by using R package “pheatmap” (https://www.r-project.org). To quantify the junction-reads from subgenomic RNAs, the STAR2.7.5c was used for reads mapping. The junction-reads was defined and collected as described[45]. A Sankey diagram was drawn by using R packages named “networkD3” and “dplyr”.IFN-β, neutralizing antibody and drug treatmentTo assess the antiviral efficacies of the materials, 1×104 Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 GFPΔN virus at MOI of 0.05. For neutralizing antibody treatment, virus was incubated with neutralizing antibody for 1 hour at 37°C before infection. For IFN-β (Sino Bioligical, 10704-HNAS-5) test, cells were pre-treated with IFN-β for 8 hours before infection. For remdesivir (MedChemExpress, HY-104077), lopinavir (biochempartner, BCP01395) or ritonavir (biochempartner, BCP03777) treatment, drugs were added simultaneously upon infection. Two days after infection, flow cytometry was performed to analyze GFP positive rate. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50; compound concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% reduction of GFP positive cells) were determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Cell viability assayCaco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plate (1×103 cells/well). After 12 hours, cells were treated with drugs with different concentrations. Cell viability was measured two days post treatment with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7570) following standard protocol. In brief, cells in 100 μl culture medium were added with 100 μl CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 15 minutes, luminescence was recorded with GloMax (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Flow cytometry analysisCells were detached in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA and then washed once with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRFortessa SORP (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.Western blottingSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting was conducted as follows: After trypsinization and cell pelleting at 1500 r/m for 10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked at room temperature for 0.5 h using 5% nonfat milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-N (05–0154, AbMax), S (40589-T62, Sino Biological), β-Tubulin (CW0098, CWBIO), Flag (F7425, Sigma), ACE2 (10108-T24, Sino Biological) in 5% nonfat milk in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were then washed in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After 1h exposure to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent washes were performed as described for the primary antibodies. Membranes were visualized using the Luminescent image analyzer (GE).Antiviral screeningTwelve hours prior to infection for the antiviral screening 5 × 104 Caco-2-Nint cells were seeded in 96 well plates. The next day, a single dilution of each compound of the Topscience Natural Product Library at 5 μM final concentration was added to the cells (50 μL/well). DMSO or remdesivir (3.5μM) were included in each plate as the internal control. After 2 hours, 50 μL of virus was added to the wells at MOI 0.05. Two days after infection, cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis to determine the GFP expression.Evaluation of antiviral activity using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virusA549 cells stably expressing human ACE2 were seeded in a 96-well plate (4×104 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with drugs (Lycorine chloride (TargetMol, T2774), Tubeimoside I (TargetMol, T2715), Nigericin sodium (TargetMol, T3092), Monensin sodium (MedChemExpress, HY-N0150), Salinomycin (MedChemExpress, HY-15597)) of different concentration for 2 hours prior to infection. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS culture medium for 24 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1 μg/ml) at 4°C overnight. After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo #A32732, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by staining with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an Operetta High Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). For high content imaging, two biological replicates for each concentration of drug were scanned and five representative fields were selected for each well of 96-well plates. Image analysis was performed using the PerkinElmer Harmony high-content analysis software 4.9. Cells were automatically identified by DAPI (nuclei). Mean fluorescent intensity of channel Alexa 555 (viral nucleocapsid) of each cell were subsequently calculated, respectively. For the 0% inhibition control, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in N protein expression. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the dose-response (variable slope) equation (four parameter logistic equation).SARS-CoV-2 infection and biosafetyThe SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-SH01 (GenBank accession no. MT121215) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and propagated in Vero E6 cells for use. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of Tsinghua University has approved the SARS-CoV-2 trVLP cell culture system use in BSL-2 if the Caco-2-Nint cells were used for infection by SARS-CoV-2 trVLP within 8 passages.

Prepare the conversion cassette SU32 by PCR using a plasmid pSU32 as template. To obtain this template, visit the following webpage. http://www.iac.saga-u.ac.jp/lifescience/su32/index.htmb.  For PCR amplification, the primer pair was pSU30-14 and pSU30-23 (40 cycles of 98~^°C for 10 sec, 55~^°C for 15 sec, and 68~^°C for 75 sec using Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase) (Goto and Nagano, 2013). When we conduct the PCR reaction, we use Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase, but you can use the other proofreading DNA polymerases. Note: Although we purified the amplified conversion cassette in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential (purification is required for DNA quantification).c.  Confirm the amplification by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicon size is about 2.7 kb (2,651 bp) (Figure 3).()Conversion cassette SU32# Figure 3. Conversion cassette SU322.  Preparation of the linearized E. coli plasmid vector a.  Digest the E. coli plasmid vector within the crossover region by using restriction enzyme.Notes:i.   The required restriction ends can be located anywhere within the crossover regions of the vector. You can use both blunt-end restriction enzyme and sticky-end restriction enzyme, because restriction ends are not positions where joining reactions occur.ii. This E. coli plasmid vector must contain the Ampr gene.iii.  PCR amplification of the E. coli plasmid vector is another way to prepare the linearized E. coli plasmid vector.iv.  Although we purified the digested plasmid in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the digestion by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.c.  Next Figure shows one of the examples of the restriction digestion (Figure 4 also shows how to join the DNA fragments).()pUC19 digested by EcoRI-HF and Xbal# Figure 4. pUC19 digested by EcoR I-HF and Xba I3.  Preparation of the DNA fragment to be cloned.a.  Amplify a DNA fragment of interest by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerase suchas Prime STAR GXL DNA Polymerase.# Notes:i. PCR primers should be designed to carry the sequences with more than 20 bp of homology to the crossover region. We often use the sequences with 30-40 bp of homology to the crossover region. For the highest efficiency, we recommend you to use PCR primers purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the PAGE purification is not essential.ii.  Although we purified the DNA fragment of interest in our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013), this purification step is not essential.b.  Confirm the amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis.# 4.  Transformation of DNA fragments into yeast.# Notes:i.   In our laboratory, we perform the transformation procedure at half or quarter scale of this method. ii.   The molar ratio of the 3 DNA fragments was 1:1:1. However, this ratio is not important (Goto and Nagano, 2013). (Ten-fold variation of the ratio probably does not affect the efficiency.) Required amount of the conversion cassette SU32 is < 50n g. . b.  Select the transformants by incubating yeast cells on synthetic complete plates lacking tryptophan at 30~^°C for 2 or 3 days.# 5.  Purification of plasmid from yeast.Note: To purify plasmid DNAs from yeast, we use a Mini-M Plasmid DNA ExtractionSystem, but you can use the other Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit for E. coli.a.  Scrape all colonies from the plates with plating beads, and collect yeast cells by the centrifuge. Using the microfuge, centrifuge cells at 14,000× g for 5 sec (we often use the picofuge at a maximum speed for 30 sec). Remove the supernatant.b.  Add the suspension buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 200~ul of MX1 buffer), and suspend the yeast cells by vortexing.c.  Scoop equal amounts of acid-washed glass beads (350-500~um) to the suspended solution using 1.5~m~ tube, add glass beads into tube containing the suspended solution, and then disrupt yeast cells by shaking 3 times for 20 sec at speed 5.5 using the FastPrep FP100A. Alternatively, vortex 5 times for 1 min at maximum speed. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()d.  Add denaturation buffer (in the case of Mini-M Kit, we use 250~ul of MX2 buffer), and gently mix.e.  Punch a hole in the bottom of the tube by needle (18 gauge). Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()()f.   Attach another tube to the bottom of the tube, and centrifuge them to recover the denatured solution in the bottom tube. Next pictures show these experimental steps.()()()g.  For subsequent procedures, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. However, use elution solution preheated to 70~^°C . Because DNA concentration of the eluted solution is low, you cannot determine the concentration of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometer. However, the DNA concentration of the eluted solution is sufficient for next procedures. Therefore, the condensation of the eluted solution is not required.6.  Pretreatment of the eluted solution (Optional)a.  For the highest efficiency, digest 5~ul of the recovered plasmids (the eluted solution) with small amounts (in.g. 0.2 lHl) ) of an appropriate restriction enzyme by directly adding the enzyme to the eluted DNA solution. Note: Because the principle of this method is complicated, read our paper (Goto and Nagano, 2013) carefully. Do not add an enzyme reaction buffer, because the salt may affect the next electroporation step.b.  Incubate the tube at an appropriate temperature for more than 1 h.7.

Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Margate, UK) ages 10–12 weeks (22–26 g) were used (n = 132 in total) for all protocols.In vitro production and labelling of MVsTo provide a defined, inflammation-relevant and abundant source of MVs for in vivo tracking studies in mice, we used the semi-adherent J774A.1 macrophage cell line (ECACC, UK: ECACC-91051511) which produces EVs rapidly in response to extracellular ATP stimulation via the P2X7 receptor signalling pathway [26]. Activation of the P2X7 receptor by a typical danger signal ATP is a potent stimulus for MV release and is central to the development of sterile and infectious inflammation and tissue injury [31]. Confluent cells in 60 mm tissue culture dishes were rinsed multiple times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, with calcium and magnesium) to remove any cellular debris and EVs, and then stimulated for 30 min, with 3 mM ATP (Bio-Techne, UK) in PBS at 37°C. Although more prolonged exposure (>2 h) to ATP at this concentration can produce non-apoptotic cytotoxicity in J774 cells [32], and other cell types [33], viability was high (>90%) in cells harvested from plates after this brief ATP stimulation, in agreement with the previous study [32]. Released EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation in an Eppendorf angle rotor (FA45-30-11) microfuge at 300 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet cells, followed by medium speed centrifugation of the supernatant at 20,800 × g at 4°C for 15 min to enrich MVs in pellets. EV preparations were labelled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK), a lipophilic, far-red fluorescent dye previously used in in vivo and in vitro EV uptake studies [34–36] The pellet was resuspended with PBS, 0.5% clinical-grade human albumin solution (HAS) and incubated at room temperature with DiD, prediluted (30 µM) in Diluent C (Sigma), at a final concentration 5 µM for 7 min. The mixture was then further diluted with PBS-HAS and washed twice by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 15 min) with careful removal of supernatant to remove unbound DiD. MV-specific DiD staining was assessed by flow cytometry in combination with plasma membrane markers and comparison to typical exosome markers. To assess levels of MV incorporated DiD versus unbound DiD, labelled and washed preparations were incubated with anti-CD11b immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 1 × 108 DiD/CD45/CD11b-positive events per 50 µl of microbeads for 30 min at 4°C. Application to magnetized LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) was followed by collection of unbound flow-through and column-bound fractions. DiD fluorescence was measured in PBS, Triton X-100 (0.5%) at 635 nm/680 nm excitation/emission in a Biotek FLx800 plate reader.LiposomesLiposomes were supplied by Encapsula NanoSciences (Brentwood, TN, USA) as phosphatidylcholine only (PC-liposomes) and phosphatidylcholine and PS at a 1:1 molar ratio (“PS-liposomes”) sized to 100 nm using high-pressure argon extrusion. DiD labelling of PS-liposomes for in vivo experiments was performed as for MVs.In vivo model of subclinical endotoxemia and MV challengeSub-clinical endotoxemia was induced by single, low-dose LPS (20 ng, Ultrapure Escherichia coli O111:B4; InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) i.v. injection [21]. For determination of MV uptake, a standardized dose of DiD-labelled MVs (2.4 × 105 fluorescence units/200 µl, equivalent to a count of ~1.0 × 108 MVs) suspended in PBS was injected i.v. via the tail vein to either untreated or LPS-pretreated mice. After 1 h, mice were anesthetized, heparinized and exsanguinated, before rapid excision and processing of total lung and spleen, and a weighed portion of the liver, for flow cytometric analysis.Macrophage depletion in vivoIntravascular-resident macrophages and monocytes were depleted by i.v. injection of 0.2 ml of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA). MV challenge experiments were performed after 72 h when vascular Ly6Chigh monocytes were repopulated from the bone marrow reservoir but before significant restoration of blood Ly6Clow monocytes [21,37,38], or liver and splenic macrophages (Supplementary Figure S1) [39,40].Isolated perfused lung (IPL)For assessing pulmonary intravascular uptake of MVs in isolation from the systemic circulation, mouse IPL was performed as described by us in recent publications [41,42]. In brief, untreated or low-dose LPS pretreated (i.v., 20 ng, 2 h) mice were injected i.p. with xylaxine (13 mg/kg)/ketamine (130 mg/kg) to induce general anaesthesia, injected i.v. via a tail vein with 20 IU of heparin, and the trachea intubated and connected to the ventilator on continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H2O. After exsanguination via the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary artery and left atrium were cannulated and perfusion performed with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 4% clinical-grade human albumin solution at a slow rate of 0.1 ml/min increasing gradually to a constant flow rate of 25 ml/kg/min with an open, non-recirculating circuit to remove blood and loosely marginated cells in a total perfusate volume of 3 ml. Perfusion was then switched to the closed, recirculating circuit (volume 2.5 ml) and the same fluorescence-standardized dose of MVs as used in vivo was infused via the perfusion circuit reservoir and recirculated for 1 h.In vitro MV uptake assayMechanisms of MV uptake were investigated in vitro using leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation as the most anatomically relevant and abundant source, contrasting with blood where monocytopenia severely limits cell recovery during endotoxemia. Following terminal anaesthesia and heparinization, inflated lungs were perfused with HBSS (without Ca2+/Mg2+)-albumin (4%) via the pulmonary artery at a high constant flow of 50 ml/h for 12 min for maximal recovery of blood and marginated cells from the left atrium. Based on preliminary evaluations of MV uptake (Supplementary Figure S2), in vitro incubations of MVs with washed perfusate cells were performed at standardized density of 5 × 104 Ly6Chigh monocytes/ml in HBBS-HAS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) in Eppendorfs with continuous mixing for 1 h.Flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions were prepared from excised tissue as described previously [43] with minor modifications. Tissues were disaggregated in formaldehyde fixative in MACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) with a gentleMACS™ Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Ltd., Bisley, UK) for 1 min. For cell counts, ice-cold flow cytometry wash buffer (PBS, 2% FCS, 0.1 mM sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA) was added directly to suspensions, or for DiD detection, after a further 5 min fixation at room temperature. This method of combining rapid tissue disaggregation and cell dispersal with simultaneous fixation aimed to minimize any MV binding and internalization at the point of tissue harvest, contrasting with standard enzyme-based tissue disaggregation methods that require relatively prolonged incubations at 37°C. For quantification of cell surface receptor expression, single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzyme digestion with collagenase A (1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNAse1 (0.1 mg/ml, Roche) at 37°C for 20 min. Cell suspensions were sieved through a 40 µm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-One, UK) and washed prior to antibody staining. The following specificity fluorophore-conjugated rat anti-mouse (unless stated otherwise) mAbs were used: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (BM8), Ly-6G (1A8), Ly-6C (HK1.4), NK-1.1 (PK136), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), CD31 (MEC13.3), CD41 (MWReg30), MerTK (2B10C42), TIM4 (RMT4-54), CD51 (RMV-7), CD9 (MZ3), CD63 (NVG-2), LAMP2 (M3/84), hamster anti-CD61 (HMβ3-1), CD68 (FA-11), CD36 (HM36), CD81 (Eat-2) all from Biolegend (London, UK); human anti-CD204 (REA148) from Miltenyi Biotec Ltd.; and anti-MARCO (ED31) from Bio-Rad (Watford, UK). Gating strategies for intravascular monocyte subsets and neutrophils were based on CD11b, Ly6G, Ly6C, F4/80, MHCII, NK1.1 staining as previously described [41,43,44]. Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages were identified as CD45+, CD11b-low/med and F4/80+ [45] (Supplementary Figure S1) and endothelial cells as CD31-positive and CD41/CD45-negative [22]. Cell counts were determined using Accucheck counting beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were acquired using a Cyan ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), with EV events acquired using a side scatter trigger threshold. Analysis of data was performed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). MV uptake for each cell population was quantified as cell-associated DiD mean (geometric) fluorescence intensity (MFI). Total MV uptake per organ was calculated as: [cell-associated DiD MFI for each mouse – group mean background fluorescence (untreated mice) MFI] × group mean cell count/organ.Confocal microscopyCell suspensions were treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (Miltenyi Biotech Ltd.) and leukocytes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Washed cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Ly6C biotin-conjugated mAb (clone HK1.4, BioLegend) at 4°C overnight, followed by Alexa Fluor-488 streptavidin (BioLegend) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were cytospin-centrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides (Sigma) and mounted with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope, with Zeiss KS-300 software and analysed using FIJI software.Data analysisNormality was determined using QQ plots and Shapiro–Wilk tests using IBM SPSS 25 software.

Preparation of the labeled DNA fragment1.  Label the 5' end of one of the oligonucleotides to be used to make the fragment to footprint. Choose the oligo so that the suspected binding site is not too far from the labeled end. Normally the footprint should be performed on both strands of the DNA, i.e. using two DNA fragments labeled at either end. Use a 0.5ml tube suitable for PCR. 3 μl Oligo 1, 10 pmoles/μl 2 μl 10x PNK buffer (supplied by manufacturer of PNK) 3 μl γ- 32P ATP (3,000 Ci/mmole 11 μl H2O1 μl (10 units) PNKIncubate 30 min 37^°CN.B.

Vortex well and give a quick centrifugation to place all labeled oligo in bottom of tube.8.  Add 5ul Thermopol buffer (Biolabs or other suitable Taq polymerase buffer). 5 μl deoxyNTP mix containing 2.5m M each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, DTTP. 4 μl Oligo 2 10 pmoles/μl (Oligo 2 corresponds to the other end of fragment to be amplified). 1 μl template DNA (e.g. plasmid DNA carrying the cloned region to be amplified, about 50 ng depending on size of plasmid. We usually use 1 μl 1/10 dilution of standard mini plasmid DNA preparation). Mix well, quick centrifugation and add 0.5~ul (2.5 units) Taq polymerase (5 units/μl) and immediately start PCR.9.

Final extension 5 min 72^°C * The temperature of annealing depends upon the oligonucleotides used and the extension time at 72^°C on the length of the fragment amplified. Footprints on fragments greater than 500 bp are not recommended and so 30 sec is usually good for most fragments.10. Test 12 ul on small agarose gel (containing ethidium bromide or other suitable DNA detection reagent) for amplification of a fragment of the correct size and check you have a fragment of the correct size in good yield (i.e. most or all of the oligos have been used up) 30 pmoles of oligos can give maximally 2u of a fragment of 100 bp and 10 u of a fragment 500 bp.  Proceed to purification. In theory you can use the PCR as it is or after passage through a spin column. However any minor, shorter length contaminants will produce artifactual bands in the footprint and the presence of unincorporated radioactivity will not allow you to estimate the amount of radioactive DNA in the footprinting reactions. So we always proceed to purify the labeled DNA from an agarose gel. In exceptional cases e.g. to eliminate a close running contaminant band from a short (100-200 bp) fragment, the fragments can be purified on a native acrylamide gel (see step A-14 below).11. Run the PCR mixture, mixed with 10~ul of loading dyes, on a small 1% agarose gel in 50 mM TBE buffer. Usually the whole 50ul PCR can be loaded in 3 wells.12. Visualize the gel on a long wavelength (365n m) transilluminator (to minimize damage to the DNA by short wavelength) and cut out the agarose containing the radioactive fragment. Discard rest of gel as radioactive waste.13. Extract the DNA from agarose using a gel purification kit (e.g. Machery-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up). Elute in 50ul elution buffer.14. To purify the DNA from an acrylamide gel: run the PCR mix on a native acrylamide gel ( 5.8% depending upon size in 50~m M TBE at room temperature i.e. do not allow the gel to heat up. Depending upon the size of the apparatus used 100-200 volts should be adequate). Locate the radioactive DNA by short exposure of the wet gel wrapped in Saran wrap to a phosphorimager screen (or X-ray film). The piece of acrylamide containing the radioactive band is cut out and the radioactive DNA eluted by shaking overnight at 37~^°C in 1 m of 0.5~M~ ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA. Separate the aqueous phase from the acrylamide gel piece by centrifugation and transfer to another tube. Extract with 0.5~ml phenol/CHCl3 and precipitate the DNA with 2.5 volumes ethanol in dry ice for at least 30 m i n . Centrifuge 10 min 4 ^°C , remove all the supernatant, dry in vacuo 2-3 m i n ) Resuspend in 50~ul elution buffer (as for DNA eluted from agarose.).15. Run 1~ul on a new small agarose gel and estimate the quantity by comparison to the staining intensity of marker DNAs (e.g. 100 bp ladder).16. Count 1 μl by Kerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter or estimate using a Geiger counter. Expect to have 50,000-150,000 cpm/ul with about 5-50 ng DNA/μl (yield in range 10–50% of  the  moles  of  starting  oligonucleotide.)  You  can  calculate  the  molar concentration of the DNA fragment from the length of the fragment in bp and using 1 bp corresponds to a molecular mass of 660.# B.  The footprinting reaction.  All protein and DNA dilutions are made in 1x binding buffer. Protein dilutions are made at 4^°C to minimize any instability of the protein in dilute solutions. Binding reactions can be made at RT or at 30~^°C or 37~^°C depending upon the experiment. E.g. most prokaryotic transcription factors bind DNA at RT. E.coli RNA polymerase will only form open complexes at 37^°C .2.  The binding buffer we usually use is Hepes-Glutamate. The concentration of K glutamate can be increased or decreased according to the experiment; generally higher salt favors specificity but decreases affinity.  M g++ salts (1-10 mM) can be added according to the experiment, e.g. M g_++ is required for RNA polymerase binding. The BSA is added to stabilize dilute proteins and prevent non-specific absorption to the microfuge tube. The reaction mix in general consists of 20ul DNA solution to which we add 20ul of the diluted protein (if several components need to be tested at the same time the volume for each component can be reduced accordingly to give a final volume of 40ul) ).3.  To test a range of protein concentrations for binding to the labeled DNA. Make a suitable volume of binding buffer and keep on ice. Prepare a series of dilution tubes for the protein to test over a range of concentrations. This range depends entirely on the protein under study as binding constants can vary from nM to nearly mM. E.g. for 10 serial dilution of ^1/_2 concentration each step, Prepare 10 tubes with 25ul binding buffer on ice.4.  Prepare a suitable volume of labeled DNA e.g. For 12 reactions prepare 240~ul binding buffer and add labeled DNA fragment to have about 20,000 -100,000 cpm/reaction. Mix well. Ideally this should give a final concentration of the DNA of about 1 nM in the 40~ul footprinting reaction, if binding constants of protein to DNA are in the nM range.5.  Dispense 20ul of the DNA mix into 12.5ml microtubes at RT.6.  Make the protein dilutions on ice and immediately mix the diluted protein with the DNA at RT. E.g. Dilute the protein to 1 uM in 50~ul binding buffer. a.  Add 20~ul to one tube of DNA (to give final concentration of 500n M ). Mix by pipetting. Leave at RT until finished all mixes. b.  Take 25ul of the 1 uM dilution and mix with 25ul binding buffer in next dilution tube. c.  Add 20ul of this dilution to the next DNA tube (final concentration 250 nM). d.  Take 25ul of the 0.5uM dilution and mix with 25ul binding buffer in next dilution tube. e.  Continue for the whole series of 10 dilutions.7.  Add 20 u/ × binding buffer to two DNA samples for the (essential) controls without protein.8.  Incubate for 10 min at RT (or at chosen temperature for chosen time).9.  Meanwhile prepare a suitable dilution of DNase I in DNase I dilution buffer. It is crucial to find the correct DNase I concentration to get limited DNase attack so that not all the DNA is degraded. As there should in theory be no more than 1 break/DNA strand, the majority (80-90%) ) of the DNA should be full length.It is usually necessary to make a pilot experiment with each new stock of DNase I to test a series of dilutions of DNase I with a DNA fragment (in the absence of binding proteins) to find the concentration which gives an adequate ladder but leaves full length DNA at the top of the gel. The amount of DNase I used should be lower for longer DNA fragments. The amount given below is a guideline only.10. DNase I stock of 5mg/ml in DNase I storage buffer (store in aliquots at -20^°C_, ). Dilute about 10,000 fold (e.g. 2~ul to 200~ul , in DNase I dilution buffer, then take 2~ul of the first dilution to 200ul DNase I dilution buffer) to give 0.5u/ m l .11. To make the footprint reactions: T=0 add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 1. Mix gently by pipetting. T=15 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 2. Mix gently by pipetting.  T=30 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 3. Mix gently by pipetting.  T=45 sec Add 4ul dilute DNase I to the footprint mix 4. Mix gently by pipetting. T=60 sec Add 100ul phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 1. Vortex to stop reaction T=75 sec Add 100 μl phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 2. Vortex to stop reaction. T=90 sec Add 100ul phenol pH 8.0 to the footprint mix 3. Vortex to stop reaction. T=105 sec Add 100ul phenol p H8.0 to the footprint mix 4. Vortex to stop reaction. Repeat until all the tubes have been treated. Precise timings are crucial to get precise and comparable DNase I digestions in each lane (some researchers prefer to use longer times and more dilute DNase I).12. Add 200ul DNase I STOP solution to each reaction. Vortex well.13. Centrifuge 10 min RT.14. Transfer the aqueous upper phase (careful not to take any phenol) to a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube.15. Add 600 μl 96% ethanol. Mix well and incubate in dry ice for 1 h (or overnight at -80~^°C_iota ).16. Centrifuge 15 min, 4^°C , 12,000× g. .17. Remove the supernatant carefully with a pipette and 1 ml pipette tip. Depending upon the number of cpm used per reaction and the sensitivity of the available Geiger counter, verify that some radioactivity is in the (invisible) pellet with a Geiger counter. If the herring sperm DNA, used in the DNase I STOP to aid precipitation, has not been sufficiently sonicated or too much has been used, the DNA pellet might not adhere to the microfuge tube and can be lost with the ethanol.18. Centrifuge again, 5 min 4^°C . Remove the rest of the liquid with a 20~ul pipette tip. Verify that the radioactivity is still in the tube.19. Dry in vacuo 5 min.20. Resuspend in 5 ul H_2O and add 6 μl gel loading formamide dyes (deionized formamide with Bromophenol blue and Xylene cyanol). Vortex well. Quick centrifuge to put all liquid in bottom of tube.21. Heat to 90~^°C for 2 min.  Quench in ice and immediately load (5~ul) onto a denaturing (7 M urea) acrylamide sequencing gel, acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide), which has been prerun for 30 min to 1 h to get hot. Voltage and wattage depends upon the apparatus used. We use 60 watts for the Model S2. Use with 5-10% final concentration acrylamide depending on the size of the fragment under investigation.22. To locate the site of protein binding it is necessary to calibrate gels with molecular weight markers. E.g. DNA marker pBR322 digested with MspI, treated with alkaline phosphatase (e.g. Antarctic alkaline phosphatase) and labeled with γ- ^32P ATP and PNK or a sequencing ladder prepared using the same Oligo 1, which was used for the radioactive labeling of the fragment.23. Electrophorese at 60 watts for a 30×30 plates and 1 mM thick gels using the Model S2 apparatus. Adjust volts and power for other sized gels. Time of migration depends upon the size of the fragment and expected position of protein binding sites (generally 80 min to 3 h).24. After migration, allow to cool slightly, open plates, transfer the gel to Whatman 3 m m paper. Cover with Saran wrap and dry on a gel drying apparatus.25. Put the dried gel, still covered with Saran to expose in a Phosphorimager cassette overnight (alternatively expose to X-ray film with an intensifying screen).26. The pattern of DNase I cleavages with and without protein indicates the site of protein binding (Figure 1). Deformations such as bent or looped DNA are indicated by hypersensitive cleavages compared to the control (free DNA), since bending of the DNA has facilitated attack by DNase I in the wider minor groove formed on the outside of the loop or bend (Figure 2).()A.

Using the Image Quant program, it is possible to quantify the amount of radioactivity in specific bands or regions, corresponding to protein protected sites and non-protected regions, and hence to derive binding constants for the proteins.# Recipes1.
