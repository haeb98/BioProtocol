Six to eight weeks after injections, whole-mount, hematoxylin and eosin, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to evaluate the type and extent of growth of the DCIS-like lesions.

Furthermore, sufficient amounts of primary DCIS tissue available for research purposes are often inadequate. Therefore, the main goals were to design a method for expansion of human DCIS tissue in vivo and to develop models that would represent various subtypes of human DCIS. Many investigators have tried, with limited success, to develop xenograft models of human DCIS by a variety of methods including humanized fat-pad transplantation. The reason for the limited success may be that DCIS has been treated like an invasive lesion rather than a lesion limited in its growth potential under very restrictive conditions. With the idea that DCIS initiates and grows inside the ducts, we used intraductal transplantation. This approach involves injection of human DCIS cells directly into the primary ducts (Figure 1, and video [see Additional data file 1] demonstrate the intraductal-transplantation technique). We intentionally mimicked DCIS in the mouse to the closest condition to that found in vivo in the human disease. Two established DCIS cell lines, DCIS.COM, SUM-225, and a primary human DCIS lesion were used. The primary human DCIS cells were obtained by digestion of a primary human DCIS tumor. A pathologist diagnosed the primary human DCIS lesion. The researchers were blind to any other patient identifiers. The take rate was 90% for all three cell lines. The cells were injected at 40,000 cells in 2 μl. Three replicates for DCIS.COM (ratio of growth, 9:10, 5:6, and 6:6), two replicates for SUM-225 (ratio of growth, 5:6 and 5:6), and one replicate for the primary human DCIS, FSK-H7 (ratio of growth, 9:10) were found. None of the xenografts in this study was serially transplanted. Both DCIS.COM and SUM-225 are unique because they progress through a DCIS-like stage during tumor formation. The DCIS-like lesions generated by the DCIS.COM cell line slowly progressed to invasive lesions in 10 weeks, whereas those generated by the SUM-225 did not become invasive during the 10-week study period. In one study, three (25%) of 10 mammary fat pads injected with DCIS.COM generated invasive cancers in 10 weeks. This is in contrast to other established invasive breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7, that develop extensive invasive cancers in as early as 4 weeks after intraductal injections in six of six fat pads (unpublished data). None of the DCIS-like lesions generated by FSK-H7 (primary human DCIS cells) showed invasion during the 6-week study period.Figure 2 shows whole-mount and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of intraductal lesions generated from DCIS.COM (A, B), SUM-225 (C, D), and the primary human DCIS, FSK-H7 (E, F) 6 weeks after injection. SUM-225 exhibited a comedo pattern, whereas DCIS.COM exhibited a cribriform pattern. Previously, it was reported that DCIS.COM generates a comedo DCIS when injected subcutaneously [3]. This difference, most likely, is due to the subcutaneous versus intraductal sites of injections. Injection of the primary human DCIS cells (FSK-H7) generated apocrine-like DCIS lesions. Interestingly, the whole mounts show that many of the growths appear to be at the periphery and separated from the point of injection. This may be because the cells were injected when the SCID-beige mice were 6 to 8 weeks old, when the ducts are expanding. At the time of ductal expansion, the terminal ducts may provide a favorable environment for cancer cell growth. The reason for this effect is not known.To assess the human and mouse origin of cells within the intraductal lesions, immuno-fish (FISH) was performed by using anti-mouse smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 3A-C) and anti-human pan-cytokeratin antibodies (D-E), fluorescently labeled human (green) (F-J), and mouse (red) Cot1 DNA probes for FISH (K-O). The data show that human cells, indicated by green human Cot1 probe staining, are surrounded by mouse myoepithelial cells and myofibroblasts, indicated by a red mouse Cot1 probe. Therefore, the intraductal model recapitulates human DCIS by allowing the cancer cells to grow within the boundaries of the mouse basement membrane and myoepithelial cells. Furthermore, the model provides a unique opportunity for studying the factors that influence the process of cancer cell invasion into the stroma.The transitional process of in situ breast lesion to invasive carcinoma is currently poorly understood. It has been proposed that the loss of myoepithelial cells concurrent with degradation of the basement membrane may play a major role in DCIS invasive progression. A recent report described the role of myoepithelial cells in this process in detail [5]. By subcutaneous transplantation of DCIS.COM, this group demonstrated that myoepithelial cells suppress, whereas fibroblasts enhance DCIS invasive progression. It was further demonstrated that the loss of myoepithelial expression of TGFβ R2 and SMAD-4, Gli-2, and MMP14 play a role in the invasive progression of DCIS [5]. Thus, the current model allows the study of many early processes of breast cancer cell invasion into the stroma, including the interactions of cancer cells with the surrounding normal luminal and myoepithelial cells as well as the basement membrane.Developing subtype-specific models of human DCIS xenograft linesThe long-term goal of our studies is to develop subtype-specific stable xenograft models of human DCIS by intraductal transplantation. The xenograft lines are termed stable if their morphology, subtype specificity, and invasive properties remain unchanged with repeated transplantation. Subtype-specific xenograft lines should allow one to study the distinct molecular and biologic mechanisms underlying the invasive progression of subtypes of human DCIS. We have identified two cell lines, DCIS.COM and SUM-225, that generate stable basal-like and Her-2-overexpressing DCIS-like lesions, respectively. Intraductal xenografts of a human primary DCIS, FSK-H7, generated Her-2-overexpressing lesions.Previous studies have shown that immunoassays may be used to predict the tumor subtypes identified with microarray analyses with a high degree of specificity [see Additional data file 3) [9,10]. Accordingly, immunofluorescence studies using anti-human cytokeratin-8 (CK-8), CK-19, CK-5, estrogen receptor (ER), Her-1, and Her-2 antibodies were performed. Figure 4 shows that SUM-225 and FSK-H7 lesions uniformly express CK-19 (A, C), whereas DCIS.COM lesions are CK-19 negative (B). SUM-225 and FSK-H7 express Her-2 (D-F), whereas CK-5 is exclusively expressed by DCIS.COM (G-L). All three intraductal lesions express CK-8; however, none of the lesions expresses ER (data not shown). These results suggest that DCIS.COM generates basal-type lesions, whereas SUM-225 and FSK-H7 generate Her-2-overexpressing lesions ([see Additional data file 1], and Figure 4).DCIS.COM and SUM-225 may contain distinct subpopulations with significantly higher in vivo growth potentialWe further used the intraductal model to test the hypothesis that xenografts representing two distinct subtypes of DCIS-like lesions may contain distinct tumor-initiating subpopulations. The two DCIS cell lines were used for this study. The cell lines were analyzed for the expression of human mammary basal and luminal surface markers. Figure 5 is a histogram depicting the relative expression level of the individual markers in DCIS.COM and SUM-225. The expression level is arbitrarily designated low (lo) if the log10 of the median fluorescence intensity (FI) is between about 0 and 2, medium (med) if the FI is between about 2.1 and 3.6, and high (hi) if the FI is higher than about 3.7. The data in Figure 5 show that DCIS.COM expressed a hi level of the basal markers (CD44 and CD49f) and lo levels of the luminal markers (CD24 and MUC-1). In contrast, SUM-225 expressed medium levels of the basal markers and hi levels of the luminal markers. Various subpopulations expressing putative markers of mammary stem and progenitor cells were sorted with flow cytometry and transplanted. These subpopulations (Tables 1 and 2; column 2) were chosen based on previous reports of markers expressed by human breast stem/progenitors, mouse mammary epithelial stem cells, and human breast tumor-initiating cells [10,11]. The gates for the subpopulations sorted and transplanted are shown in the supplementary data [see Additional data file 4]. Fisher's Exact test was used to compare the in vivo growth potentials between the various subpopulations. Table 1 shows transplant results for two replicate experiments per sorted subpopulation per cell line. DCIS-like lesions are referred to as in vivo or intraductal growth. The number of fat pads containing positive intraductal growth over the total number of fat pads transplanted, growth fractions, and the total number of ducts containing intraductal growth are listed in Table 1, columns 3, 4, and 5, respectively. [See Additional data file 5.] Table 2 shows the results of Fisher's Exact test. As depicted in Table 1 in DCIS.COM, subpopulations expressing high levels of the basal markers and low levels of the luminal markers (CD49fhi/CD24lo, CD49fhi/MUC-1lo, and CD44hi/CD24lo) demonstrated higher in vivo growth fractions and generated more ducts containing lesions. However, as shown in Table 2 with Fisher's Exact test, none of the subpopulations in DCIS.COM achieved significantly higher growth fractions when compared with the random sort. Therefore, the majority of cells in DCIS.COM possessed tumor-initiating properties. In contrast, in SUM-225 cells, two subpopulations, CD49fmed/CD24hi and CD49fmedMUC-1hi, achieved significantly higher growth fractions compared with the random sort (Table 2). These subpopulations also generated the largest number of ducts with lesions (Table 1). Because the tumor-initiating cells in DCIS.COM and SUM-225 cells expressed distinct surface markers, we postulate that the tumor-initiating cells may arise from distinct cell types. However, lineage-tracing experiments are required to establish whether different types of tumors arise from distinct cell types. Notably, although tumor formation was not an end point for this experiment, a few palpable tumors were found in the random sort as well as the CD44hi/CD24lo groups in DCIS.COM. None of the SUM-225 subpopulations generated a tumor during the time course of our study (6 weeks).", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsIntraductal transplantation methodRecipients are 6- to 10-week-old virgin female SCID-beige mice. Before transplantation, cells are resuspended as single cells in PBS and counted from DCIS.COM, SUM225, or primary human DCIS cells. A 30-gauge Hamilton syringe, 50-μl capacity, with a blunt-ended 1/2-inch needle is used to deliver the cells. The mice are anesthetized, and a Y-incision is made on the abdomen to allow the skin covering the inguinal mammary fat pads to be peeled back to expose the inguinal gland. The nipple of the inguinal gland is snipped so that the needle can be directly inserted through the nipple. Two microliters of cell-culture medium (with 0.1% trypan blue) containing cells at a concentration of 2,500 to 5,000 cells/μl are injected; the injected liquid can be visually detected in the duct. The skin flaps are repositioned normally and held together with wound clips. The primary human DCIS was chopped very finely by using a Teflon block and razor blade or scalpel followed by overnight enzymatic digestion in DMEM/F12 with antibiotics, supplemented with collagenase (1.0 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase (100 U/ml).Animal and human experiments were conducted by following protocols approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Animal Care and Use and Human Subjects Committee. An informed consent was deemed not to be required by the Human Subjects Committee.

Monitoring of cell division by analysis of CFSE fluorescence (Figure 1A) confirmed the induction of comparable levels of cell proliferation, with most of the cells having undergone six or more cell divisions by day 10 (Figure 1B). Expression of the EBV nuclear antigens EBNA2 and EBNA1 was demonstrates by immunofluorescence staining in a large majority of the infected cells by day 7 (EBNA2 88±5%, EBNA1 72±12%). Comparable levels of cell proliferation, assessed by counting the number of live cells detected by Trypan blue dye exclusion, were maintained for up to 3 weeks, after which increasing cell death was observed in the mitogen-stimulated cultures (data not shown). A high prevalence of chromosomes with abnormal telomeres (Figure 1C), usually loss or duplication of telomere signals and telomere fusion, was detected already during the first week after EBV infection (Figure 1D). Between 50–60% of the metaphases of EBV-infected cells contained one or more chromosomes with abnormal telomeres on day 7. The proportion of atypical metaphases stabilized to approximately 30% during the following weeks. In contrast, telomere abnormalities were detected in <10% of the metaphases from mitogen-induced blasts throughout the observation period. Extra-chromosomal telomere signals (Figure 1E) were frequently detected in metaphase spreads of EBV-infected cells, indicating double-strand breaks of telomeric DNA (Figure 1F). The occurrence of abnormal telomeres (Figure 2a) and extra-chromosomal telomeres (Figure 2b) was greatly reduced in established LCLs kept in culture for extended periods of time.EBV infection induces telomere elongation in the absence of telomerase activityIn order to further investigate the effect of EBV infection on the functionality of telomeres, changes in telomere length were monitored over time by measuring the intensity of the telomere signals in micrographs of FISH-stained metaphase plates. This Q-FISH methodology affords a distinct advantage compared with analysis of telomere length by Southern blot because it provides information on the size of individual telomeres in mitotic cells and avoids possible artifacts due to the presence of variable amounts of non-proliferating or dead cells during the early phases of the cultures. A first analysis performed on EBV- and mitogen-induced blasts kept in culture for approximately 3 weeks revealed stronger signals in the virus-infected cells (Figure 3a). To examine the validity of this observation, the intensity of telomere signals was monitored weekly during the first 4 weeks of culture. As shown in Figure 3b, a modest but significant increase in the average intensity of telomere signals was detected in the chromosomes of 25 randomly selected metaphases from EBV-infected cells starting from the second week of culture. In contrast, the average intensity of telomeres from mitogen-induced blasts did not change significantly during 3 weeks, after which the analysis was discontinued because of a significant drop in cell viability. Notably, the intensity of the telomere signals was highly heterogeneous in EBV-infected cells, with a strongest:weakest signal ratio exceeding 50-fold, whereas the ratio was <10-fold in the mitogen blasts (Figure 3c).The activation of telomerase is the most common mechanism for maintenance of telomere length in mammalian cells.18 In order to monitor changes in the activity of telomerase over time, telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assays were performed with cell lysates from EBV-infected and mitogen-stimulated cells. As illustrated by the representative assay shown in Figure 3d, the activity of telomerase assessed by the intensity of the amplified products was very low in both EBV- and mitogen-induced blasts throughout the monitoring period. The mean total product generated units recorded in three independent experiments where the two types of blasts were tested in parallel in shown Figures 3e. A two- to threefold increase over baseline levels was observed on day 3 in both conditions, followed by a rapid decline. Of note, comparably low levels of activity were recorded on day 14 when the telomere signals were significantly stronger in EBV-infected cells. Thus, EBV infection promotes the increase in telomere length in the absence of a parallel increase in telomerase activity.It was previously reported that the activation of telomerase is a late event in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization.39 We compare therefore telomerase activity measured by TRAP assay (Figure 4a), and telomere length measured by Q-FISH, in a panel of six newly established LCLs cultured for approximately 1 month, and six old LCLs that were kept in culture for >5 years. As shown in Figure 4b, in four of the six newly established LCLs the activity of telomerase was within the limits of the background detected in the telomerase-negative U2OS cell line, and a minor increase was observed in two LCLs, whereas substantially higher levels of activity were regularly detected in the old LCLs. In addition, the old LCLs exhibited short telomeres with homogeneous length distribution, whereas the telomeres were longer and highly heterogeneous in the newly established LCLs (Figure 4b). The observation of shorter telomeres in cells expressing higher levels of telomerase is consistent with earlier reports showing that enforced expression of telomerase in telomerase-negative tumor cell lines is associated with the inhibition of recombination-based telomere elongation and progressive loss of long telomeres.40EBV infection activates HR-based telomere elongationThe accumulation of extra-chromosomal telomeres and increased telomere length in the absence of telomerase activity are indicative for the activation of a recombination-based mechanisms for maintenance of telomere homeostasis known as ALT.41 A recognized marker of ALT is the accumulation of PML nuclear bodies (PNBs) containing telomeric DNA known as ALT-associated PNBs (APBs).22 In addition to PML, APBs contain a variety of proteins involved in the DNA damage response, and polymerases that use sister chromatids or extra-chromosomal telomeric sequences as templates for telomere extension.42 The occurrence of APBs was monitored by immunofluorescence-FISH staining for telomeres and PML in interphase nuclei of EBV-infected cells and mitogen-induced B-blast. APBs, identified by the colocalization of PML and telomere fluorescence in a single focal plane (Figure 5a), were virtually absent in freshly isolated cells (Figure 5b). A significant increase was regularly detected already after 3 days in the EBV-infected cells and the proportion of APBs remained high during subsequent culture, whereas only a small and transient increase was observed in mitogen-induced blasts (Figure 5b).EBV-induced B-cell proliferation is associated with a transient induction of high levels of DNA damage,43 which was confirmed in our analysis by a significant increase in the number and size of PNBs (data not shown). Thus, we cannot formally exclude that the increase in APBs in interphase nuclei may be partially explained by chance colocalization of PNBs with telomere signals. In order to address this possible artifact and directly probe for the activation of ALT, we monitored the occurrence of T-SCE by chromosome orientation-FISH. In this assay, the recombination of telomeres derived from sister chromatids is visualized in metaphase chromosomes hybridized with C-rich (leading strand template, Figure 5c, green) and G-rich (lagging strand template, Figure 5c, red) probes by the colocalization of green and red fluorescence in a single telomere signal. Analysis of the prevalence of T-SCE in a panel of LCLs cultured for approximately 1 month or >5 years revealed significantly higher levels of T-SCE in the young LCLs, confirming that HR of telomeric sequences occurs in these cells. The activation of telomerase in old LCLs was accompanied by reduction of T-SCE to nearly undetectable levels (Figure 5d). Collectively, these findings suggest that during the early phases of B-cell immortalization EBV exploits recombination-based mechanisms to assure the maintenance of telomere homeostasis in rapidly proliferating cells with low or absent telomerase activity.EBV infection promotes telomere de-protectionTelomere de-protection is a common cause of DNA damage at telomeres.44 In order to assess whether uncapping might explain the telomere dysfunction phenotype induced by EBV infection, the functionality of the shelterin complex was investigated by monitoring the colocalization of telomeres with the DNA-binding subunit TRF2 in immunofluorescence-FISH assays. As illustrated by the representative micrographs shown in Figure 6a, telomeres lacking colocalized TRF2 signals were frequent in the interphase nuclei of EBV-infected cells cultured for 2 weeks. Quantitative analysis of the extent of colocalization, measured as the ratio between the intensities of the telomere and colocalized TRF2 signals revealed a significantly decreased TRF2:telomere signal ratio in the virus-infected cells compared with mitogen-induced blasts (Figure 6b). To assess whether this may correlate with defects in the expression of TRF2 or other proteins involved in the maintenance of telomere structure, the expression of the shelterin subunits TRF1, TRF2 and POT1, and the ATRX subunit of the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeler was compared in western blots. As illustrated in Figure 6c where two pairs of EBV-infected and mitogen-induced blasts were tested in parallel, and summarized by the densitometry analysis of five independent experiments shown in Figure 6d, the cells expressed comparable levels of all proteins. Thus, the telomere de-protection observed in EBV-infected cells is not due to selective loss of the shelterin or ATRX/DAXX complexes. To explore this phenomenon further, the expression of shelterin and ATRX/DAXX subunits was investigated by western blot in a panel of six newly established and six old LCLs. As illustrated by the representative blot shown in Figures 7a and b, and summarized by the densitometry of three independent experiments shown in Figures 7c and d, TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2 and ATRX were expressed at significantly lower levels in the newly established LCLs.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsB-cell isolation, EBV infection and mitogen stimulationBlood lymphocytes were purified from Buffy coats (Blood Bank, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden) by Ficoll–Paque (Lymphoprep, Axis-shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation and B cells were affinity purified using CD19 micro beads (MACS MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to standard procedures. For EBV infection, the cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with spent supernatant from the EBV producer cell line B95.8,60 and then cultured in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10–20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

The slides were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Merck) for 5 min, treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin for 10 min at 37 °C and dehydrated by consecutive 5-min incubations in 70%, 85% and 100% cold ethanol. After air drying, hybridization solution containing the Telomere PNA probe (Panagene, Cambridge Research Biomedicals, Cleveland, UK) was added, followed by heat denaturation for 3 min at 80 °C. Hybridization was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were then overlaid with washing solutions, dehydrated and mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA). Digital images were captured with a LEITZ LEITZBMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonic Norden AB, Kista, Sweden). The presence of telomere abnormalities, including telomere fusions and extra chromosomal telomere, were scored in digital images using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The fluorescence intensity of each telomere signal was scored using the Volocity Software (Improvision, University of Warwick Science Park, UK). The results are expressed as fluorescence intensity of telomeres in 25 randomly selected metaphase plates from three independent experiments.Detection of APBs and telomere-associated TRF2 by immunofluorescence-FISHThree × 104 cells in 0.1 ml phosphate-buffered saline were deposited on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation, fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (T9284, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. After blocking with 3% fetal calf serum for 30 min, the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse monoclonal antibody to PML (1:100, kind gift of Hugues de Thé, University of Paris, Paris, France), or overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibody to TRF2 (1:100, Sc-9143, Santa Cruz), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen Corp.) for 30 min. After washing and fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min and dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol, Q-FISH was performed as described above. The presence of APBs was scored in digital images captured using a LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss, Carl Zeiss AB, Stockholm, Sweden) based on colocalization of PML and telomere signals on a single focal plane using the ImagJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov). For quantification of telomere-associated TRF2, digital images were captured with an ImageXpress Micro device (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and analyzed with the MetaExpress Software (Molecular Devices). Two thousand telomere signals were identified in multiple images from each experimental condition and the intensity of red (telomere) and green (TRF2) fluorescence within each selected telomere area was quantified.Detection of telomere sister chromatid exchanges by chromosome orientation-FISHThe cells were grown in medium containing 10 μM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and BrdC (MP Biomedicals, IIIkirch, France) at 3:1 ratio for 16 h and chromosome slides were prepared as described. After treatment with 0.5 mg/ml RNAase A (Invitrogen Corp.) for 10 min at 37 °C, staining with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in 2 × SSC for 15 min at room temperature and cross-linking by exposure to 365-nm UV light (Stratalinker 1800, Agilent Technologies, St Clara, CA, USA) for 30 min, the slides were digested with 10 U/μl Exonuclease III (Fermentas, Leon-Rot, Germany) for 10 min at room temperature and sequentially incubated with TAMRA-TelG 5′-(TTAGGG)3-3′ and FITC-TelC 5′-[CCCTAA]3-3′ probes (Cambridge Research Biomedicals) at room temperature for 2 h followed by washing, dehydration and mounting with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield. Digital images were analyzed as described.Detection of telomerase activity by TRAPTelomerase activity was measured using the TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (S7700, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 200 μl of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) lysis buffer supplemented with 200 U/ml of RNAse inhibitor (N211B, Promega, Madison WI, USA). After clearing by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories AB, Solna, Sweden). The reactions were carried out with 0.1 μg of cell lysate in 25 μl of TRAP buffer, containing dNTP, primers and DNA polymerase (F120S, Hot Start DNA Polymerase, BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, UK). Cell lysates provided by the kit were used as positive control and lysates of the telomerase negative U2OS cell line were used to determine the background activity of the assays. Telomere extension was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by 28 PCR cycles including denaturation at 94 °C for 5 s, annealing at 61 °C for 30 s and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. As negative control, the lysates were heated at 85 °C for 10 min to inactivate the telomerase. The PCR products were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and electrophoresis was carried out at 300 V for 2 h, followed by staining with SYBR Gold (S11494, Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA), and visualization using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Digital images were analyzed using the Gene Imager software (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) and total product generated units were calculated as indicated by the kit.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. P-values <0.05 were considered as significant."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 10623, "tokens": 1561, "source": "regular"}, "Materials and methods": {"chars": 8780, "tokens": 1257, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2013", "doi": "10.1038/onc.2013.189", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Remarkably, we observed that BL application also rescues the short hypocotyl phenotype of these seedlings, suggesting that BR signaling overcomes the growth-repressing effects of DELLAs. Likewise, application of BL restores growth of ga1-3 GA-deficient seedlings and that of plants treated with the GA synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) (Supplemental Fig. S1). However, GAs are ineffective in promoting growth of det2-1 seedlings, deficient in BRs (Li et al. 1996), or that of wild-type seedlings treated with the BR synthesis inhibitor brassinazole (BRZ) (Nagata et al. 2000). These results are similar to those recently reported by Bai et al. (2012) and indicate that active BR signaling is required for the growth-promoting effects of GAs (Fig. 1A).To investigate at which level of the GA signaling cascade BL exerts this cross-regulation, we examined whether BL application affects accumulation of the GA receptor GID1a by using GID1a-GFP transgenic lines (Willige et al. 2007). We also generated pRGA∷GFP-RGA det2.1 lines to test whether destabilization of this repressor is compromised in the BR-deficient background. As shown in Supplemental Figure S2A, neither hormone nor inhibitor treatments modified the levels of the GID1a-GFP protein, indicating that BR signaling does not affect GID1 stability. Moreover, destabilization of the GFP-RGA protein was similar in det2-1 lines to that in the wild-type controls (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that BRs do not affect GA-induced degradation of this repressor. Identical results were obtained by Western blot detection with an antibody raised against the RGA protein, thus excluding an anomalous response of the GFP-RGA fusion construct (Supplemental Fig. S2B). Destabilization of DELLAs in the det2-1 background, however, does not restore hypocotyl growth (Fig. 1B), supporting a regulatory role of BR signaling downstream from the DELLAs. Consistent with these results, we found that BRZ represses growth of the constitutive GA response tetra and global mutants, with knockout mutations in four or all five DELLA genes. These mutants show a dwarf phenotype when grown on BRZ (Supplemental Fig. S3), pointing to a role of a signaling component downstream from the DELLAs in GA and BR signaling cross-talk.BRs promote accumulation of a faster-migrating form of the PIF4 factorDELLAs repress growth by binding the bHLH DNA recognition domain of PIFs, which blocks the DNA-binding ability of these factors (De Lucas et al. 2008; Feng et al. 2008). The finding that BL promotes growth of mutants overaccumulating DELLAs and that these repressors are destabilized in det2-1 plants suggested that BRs may act at the level of PIFs. To test this hypothesis, we treated transgenic 35S∷PIF4-HA plants with BL or BRZ to assess for changes in PIF4 protein levels. As shown in Figure 1C, a rapid accumulation of the PIF4-HA protein was in fact observed in dark-grown seedlings after the application of BL, indicating that stabilization of this factor is a primary response to BRs. Consistent with this observation, BRZ treatment reduced PIF4 levels, and this effect was abolished by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Stabilization of the PIF4-HA protein correlates also with a shift to a faster electrophoretic mobility band that may correspond to a nonphosphorylated form of this factor (Fig. 1C). Indeed, when plant extracts of mock-, BL-, and BRZ-treated seedlings were incubated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP), only the fastest PIF4-HA mobility band was observed (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that the slower-migrating forms correspond to phosphorylated isoforms of the protein. Therefore, these findings are suggestive of a role of BRs in PIF4 stabilization by inhibiting a protein kinase that tags this factor for proteasomal degradation.PIF4-OE lines show a hyposensitive response to BRZ and activated levels of expression of BR-regulated genesIf BRs act through the PIFs, higher levels of PIF4 activity should phenocopy BL effects. Indeed, PIF4-OE seedlings grown on BRZ are taller than wild-type controls, and these plants show a saturated response to BL (Supplemental Fig. S4). pif4pif5 seedlings, in contrast, display a hyposensitive response to this hormone and increased sensitivity to the inhibitor BRZ. An altered response toward BRZ was also observed after combined application of GA and BRZ. Pretreatment with this inhibitor blocks GA-induced elongation of wild-type and det2-1 seedlings but not that of the PIF4-OE or phyB mutant lines, which accumulate higher PIF levels due to impaired destabilization of these factors (Fig. 1D). Hence, in response to BRZ+GA application, higher levels of accumulation of the PIF4 factor lead to an elongation response similar to that observed for the constitutive BR response bes1-D mutant (Yin et al. 2002).In line with such a BR-related phenotype, a significant overlap is observed between the genes differentially expressed in PIF4-OE lines grown in red light (De Lucas et al. 2008) and in dark-grown pifq seedlings (for dark data set, see Leivar et al. 2009; for pifq data set, see Zhang et al. 2013) and those induced by BL treatment (Goda et al. 2004, 2008; Nemhauser et al. 2004, 2006; Vert et al. 2005) or down-regulated in bri1-116 seedlings (Sun et al. 2010). As shown in Figure 1E, 24.9% of the up-regulated genes in PIF4-OE seedlings and 21.1% of the genes down-regulated in dark-grown pifq seedlings are positively regulated by BL (4.8% expected randomly). Notably, genes involved in cell wall modification (pectinesterases, XTHs, and expansins) and auxin response (SAURs and Aux/IAA) are highly enriched among the coregulated genes, in agreement with recent studies establishing that PIF4 and BZR1 cooperatively regulate these gene targets (Oh et al. 2012).PIF4 interacts with the BR signaling kinase BIN2The GSK3-like kinase BIN2 negatively regulates BR signaling by inhibiting BES1/BZR1 transcriptional activity. BIN2-mediated phosphorylation of these factors inhibits DNA binding and promotes BES1/BZR1 interaction with cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins in addition to induce their degradation by the proteasome (Zhao et al. 2002; Vert and Chory 2006; Gampala et al. 2007). BR signaling inactivates BIN2 kinase activity via BSU1-mediated dephosphorylation at Tyr200, enabling nuclear accumulation of the nonphosphorylated BES1/BZR1 factors and BR-activated gene expression (Kim and Wang 2010). Thus, BIN2 is a good candidate to regulate PIF4 levels, as inactivation of this kinase by BL may result in the fastest-migrating form of this factor seen in BL-treated seedlings (Fig. 1C). A direct interaction of the full-length BIN2 protein and PIF4 was actually observed in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 2A). Deleted versions of the PIF4 protein mapped the BIN2 interaction domain to a fragment immediately C-terminal to the bHLH dimerization domain, as a PIF4 truncated version from Val312 to the C-terminal end still interacts with BIN2 (Fig. 3D). Deletion of this C-terminal end, however, does not abrogate binding, suggesting that an additional interacting domain located between residues 107 and 312 cooperates with the C-terminal region to enhance BIN2-binding affinity (Fig. 3D).Direct interaction of these proteins was confirmed by in vitro pull-down assays in which the 35SMet-labeled PIF4 and BES1 were found to be retained with similar affinities by agarose beads with the immobilized GST-BIN2 protein (Fig. 2B). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves further confirmed this interaction in vivo. Nuclear fluorescence of reconstituted split YFP was observed in leaves cotransfected with the BIN2-eYFC and PIF4-eYFN fusions but not in control leaves expressing the eYFC-BIN2 and eYFN or the eYFC and PIF4-eYFN proteins (Fig. 2C). The PIF4-GFP protein was also pulled down out of plant extracts coexpressing the BIN2-HA and PIF4-GFP proteins after immunoprecipitation of BIN2-HA (Fig. 2D), confirming interaction of these proteins in plant cells.BIN2 phosphorylates PIF4 in vitroIn vitro kinase assays using the purified GST-BIN2, PIF4-6xHis, and MBP-BES1 proteins showed that BIN2 is able to phosphorylate both BES1 and PIF4 (Fig. 3A). Labeling of these factors is only observed when BIN2 is added to the reaction mix. Also, although in pull-down assays BIN2 bound with similar affinities the BES1 and PIF4 proteins, labeling of PIF4 was weaker than that of the BES1 protein. This would suggest that PIF4 has fewer phosphorylation sites than BES1, reported to be modified by this kinase in at least 10 independent Ser/Thr residues (Ryu et al. 2010). Incubation with the specific inhibitor bikinin (De Rybel et al. 2009) blocked PIF4 phosphorylation as well as autophosphorylation of BIN2, confirming that labeling of this protein is mediated by the BIN2 kinase (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we can conclude that PIF4 is a bona fide substrate for the BR signaling kinase BIN2.Mutation of a conserved BIN2 phosphorylation consensus leads to strong PIF4 stabilizationGSK3-kinases phosphorylate Ser/Thr residues in the short consensus motif (S/T)-X-X-X-(S/T). Identification of the BES1/BZR1 factors as main BIN2 phosphorylation substrates revealed that this plant kinase phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues within the same motif (Ryu et al. 2010). However, in contrast to animal GSK3-kinases, it does not require a priming phosphorylation event to act on these proteins (Peng et al. 2010). In a search for residues that match this consensus motif in the PIF4 protein, we identified >10 putative phosphorylation sites (Supplemental Fig. S5). We reasoned that if these sites are important to modulate PIF4 stability, they should be conserved in all PIF4 orthologs. Alignment of the Arabidopsis protein with its closest homologs in other species actually identified two consensus motifs that are conserved in all PIF4/PIF5 proteins across evolutionarily divergent species (Supplemental Fig. S5). Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved T160VGPS164HCGS168 motif to replace the three Ser/Thr residues by Ala, hence generating a nonphosphorylatable PIF41A mutant protein (Fig. 3B), led to a strong stabilization of this factor (Fig. 4B,D) and reduced the efficiency of in vitro labeling by BIN2 (Fig. 3A), although it did not fully abolish phosphorylation. Residual labeling by this kinase is likely to be due to phosphorylation of the second conserved motif or secondary modification of the nonconserved sites found in the protein. However, further mutation of Ser202 to Ala to disrupt this second conserved motif did not lead to protein stabilization, indicating that this motif is less relevant for PIF4 function.Consistent with these results, lines overexpressing the PIF41A-GFP protein fusion were severely elongated and showed extremely early flowering (Fig. 4A), as anticipated for a strong stabilization of this factor. Confocal GFP fluorescence and Western blot studies confirmed higher levels of accumulation of this mutant protein fusion in the light (Fig. 4B,D), as compared with 35S∷PIF4-GFP lines showing equivalent transcript levels for the wild-type protein fusion (Fig. 4C). In dark-grown seedlings, differences in protein levels were smaller due to additional stabilization of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4D). However, subcellular localization of the PIF41A-GFP protein was not altered with respect to PIF4-GFP. Both the PIF4-GFP and PIF41A-GFP fusions show a diffuse nuclear expression and form similar nuclear speckles upon red light irradiation (Bauer et al. 2004; Leivar et al. 2008), with a pulse of far-red light reversing speckle formation in both proteins (Supplemental Fig. 6). BL treatment, on the other hand, did not alter their subcellular localization (Supplemental Fig. 6).35S∷PIF41A-GFP lines display up-regulated expression of the PIL1 transcript and respond to BL by enhanced levels of activation of this gene (Fig. 4E). When treated with BRZ, PIL1 gene expression was also found to be less suppressed in these plants than in 35S∷PIF4-GFP lines (Fig. 4E), suggestive of a stabilization of the PIF41A protein irrespective of BIN2 kinase activation.PIF41A expression partially suppresses the dwarf phenotype of bin2-1 mutantsTo further assess constitutive activation of this mutant protein, we analyzed whether PIF41A overexpression suppresses the severe dwarf phenotype of bin2-1 mutants, impaired in BR signaling due to constitutive BIN2 activation (Peng et al. 2008). As shown in Supplemental Figures S9 and S10, PIF41A expression rescued the semidwarf phenotype of heterozygous bin2-1+/− mutants but did not suppress the more severe phenotype of homozygous plants. PIF41A bin2-1 seedlings are slightly taller than the bin2-1 mutant (Supplemental Fig. S10) but still display the characteristic curled leaf and severe dwarf phenotype of these mutants. Such dosage complementation effects indicate that, in addition to PIF4, other BIN2-regulated factors are required for hypocotyl growth, in agreement with the recent finding that BZR1 binds G-box elements identical to those bound by PIF4 in the promoters of cell elongation genes (Oh et al. 2012). PIFs are actually required for BZR1-induced cell elongation, with loss-of-function mutations of the PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 genes in the pifq mutant suppressing the elongated phenotype of the constitutive bzr1-1D mutant (Oh et al. 2012). Hence, concurrent activity of the BZR1 and PIF4 factors is essential for cell elongation. The observation that bzr1-1D suppresses the dwarf phenotype of bri1-116 seedlings in the dark but not in the light and that light-grown PIF4OX bzr1-1D bri1-116 seedlings are shorter than PIF4OX lines indeed supports this regulatory model and demonstrates that phosphorylation by the BR signaling kinase BIN2 plays an important role in modulating PIF4 stability and in BR promotion of cell elongation in the light.BIN2 phosphorylation plays a main role in destabilizing the PIF4 protein at dawnGrowth of young seedlings follows a rhythmic elongation pattern such that, in short days, rapid hypocotyl growth occurs at dawn and alternates with an interval of reduced elongation during daytime and early night (Nozue and Maloof 2006). Thus, we wanted to test whether PIF4 phosphorylation plays a role in defining this window of active cell elongation. To this aim, we generated transgenic pif4pif5 lines that expressed the wild-type PIF4-HA and mutant PIF41A-HA proteins under the control of its native promoter. We selected lines in which the levels of expression of these transgenes were similar to Col-0 and verified that transcript accumulation in these plants (Fig. 5D) followed the diurnal expression pattern reported for the endogenous PIF4 gene (Nozue et al. 2007; Yamashino et al. 2013). Lines generated for the wild-type PIF4-HA protein actually had hypocotyl lengths similar to those of Col-0 plants and showed a wild-type response to PAC (Supplemental Fig. S12) and BRZ treatments (Fig. 7A,B, below). When grown at 28°C, these plants also showed an elongation growth similar to that observed for Col-0 seedlings (Supplemental Fig. S7). PIF41A-HA lines, in contrast, had taller hypocotyls and showed the characteristic elongated petioles and narrower leaves of plants grown in the shade (Figs. 5A, 7A [below]; Supplemental Fig. S7), indicative of an increased stability of this mutant protein. Indeed, PIF41A-HA was found to accumulate to higher levels than wild-type PIF4-HA, with differences in protein levels being greatest at Zeitgeber time 22 (ZT22) and ZT2, coinciding with the interval of maximal hypocotyl growth (Fig. 5B,C). PIF41A levels, in addition, did not change in response to BL or BRZ treatments, demonstrating that this mutation results in a stabilization of the protein irrespective of BR signaling (Supplemental Fig. S8).Notably, although PIFs are accepted to be destabilized by PHYB in the light, both PIF4 and PIF41A proteins were detected to significant levels during daytime and rapidly dropped after dusk, when PIF4 transcription is repressed (Fig. 5B,D; Nusinow et al. 2011). A related daytime pattern of protein accumulation was also recently reported for a PIF4-citrine-HA construct (Yamashino et al. 2013), although the taller phenotype of these plants did not exclude an additional stabilization of the protein due to the C-terminal citrine tag. Our HA-tagged lines display a hypocotyl length similar to that of Col-0, and relatively high levels of the protein were detected during daytime. Furthermore, in lines expressing the same PIF4-HA fusion under the control of the 35S promoter (Supplemental Figure S11), a preferential accumulation of the protein was seen at night, as previously reported (Nozue et al. 2007). This indicates that although stability of PIF4 is higher in darkness, active transcription of this gene may lead to substantial levels of accumulation of this factor during daytime, depending on light irradiance. However, during this phase of the day, PIF4 is repressed by the DELLAs, which were reported to accumulate in the light (Achard et al. 2007). It is also noteworthy that increased PIF41A stability during late night correlates with preferential accumulation as a faster-migrating form of the protein (Figs. 5B, 1C), although this mutation does not preclude formation of slower isoforms, suggesting that PIF4 is phosphorylated by other kinases in addition to BIN2. Indeed, upon light exposure, slower-migrating forms are observed for both the wild-type and PIF41A proteins (Fig. 5B), suggesting that PIF4 is subjected to phosphorylation by a PHYB-regulated kinase, as reported for PIF3 (Ni et al. 2013).To estimate the stabilization of this mutant protein, we treated PIF4 and PIF41A seedlings with cycloheximide (CHX) and with CHX and BL (Fig. 6A). In these studies, PIF4 is destabilized by 30 min of CHX application, while PIF41A is still detectable after 90 min of CHX treatment. Also, upon BL application, PIF4 half-life was similar to that of the PIF41A protein, whereas this hormone did not have any effect on PIF41A protein levels (Fig. 6A). Consistent with these results, when PIF4 and PIF41A lines were crossed to the bin2.1 mutant, we observed that constitutive activation of BIN2 in these seedlings leads to a strong reduction in PIF4 protein levels but has only a minor effect on PIF41A protein stability (Fig. 6B).We also assessed whether this mutation affects rhythmic plant growth by continuously measuring the growth of Col-0, PIF4-HA, PIF41A-HA, and PIF4OX seedlings during 2 d (Fig. 6C). Under short days, growth of Col-0 and PIF4-HA was maximal at dawn, while PIF4OX seedlings showed an increased growth rate during early night, as previously described (Nozue et al. 2007). Remarkably, PIF41A seedlings elongated also during daytime (Fig. 6C), indicating that BL-dependent phosphorylation of the PIF4 factor plays an important role in modulating rhythmic hypocotyl growth.PIF41A bes1-D seedlings are insensitive to BRZ in the lightThe gain-of-function bes1-D and bzr1-1D mutations cause constitutive BES1 and BZR1 activation due to identical mutations in the PEST domain, which enhance PP2A-binding affinity and lead to increased dephosphorylation of these factors (Tang et al. 2011). These mutants show a BRZ-insensitive response in the dark but opposite phenotypes in the light, although the BES1 and BZR1 proteins share 88% overall identity. While the bzr1-1D mutant displays a weak dwarf phenotype and a hypersensitive response to BRZ in the light, light-grown bes1-D seedlings are largely insensitive to this inhibitor. This phenotype is at present not well understood, as light does not seem to affect levels of these proteins (Luo et al. 2010). Since BES1 and BZR1 promote cell elongation by formation of a coactivator complex with PIF4 (Oh et al. 2012), it is possible that the hypersensitive response to BRZ of bzr1-1D seedlings results from an increased phosphorylation and destabilization of the PIF4 factor in the light. However, the BRZ-insensitive response of light-grown bes1-D mutants does not fit well with this model, unless these plants still show a reduction in hypocotyl growth on BRZ. As shown in Figure 7, A and B, bes1-D seedlings are in fact shorter on BRZ than in mock medium and display reduced levels of expression of the PIL1 and PRE5 target genes (Fig. 7C). Also, they are only slightly taller than Col-0, although BES1 is constitutively activated in this mutant. PIF41A lines, in contrast, show a much elongated phenotype but still respond to BRZ by a reduction in hypocotyl growth, indicating that the nonphosphorylatable PIF41A protein requires BES1/BZR1 function to promote cell elongation. Therefore, we introduced the bes1-D gain-of-function mutation into the pPIF4∷PIF41A lines to test whether combined expression of these two mutant proteins confers a BRZ-insensitive response in the light. Light-grown PIF41A bes1-D seedlings actually show elongated hypocotyls on BRZ similar to those in mock treatments (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that the BIN2-insensitive forms of PIF4 and BES1 are required for hypocotyl growth in the light. Gene expression quantitative PCR (qPCR) studies confirmed that expression of both PIF41A and bes1-D proteins leads to constitutive up-regulated levels of expression of the PIL1, XTR7, and PRE5 target genes on BRZ (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that BR signaling plays a prevalent role in hypocotyl elongation by suppressing BIN2 kinase activity, with inactivation of this kinase allowing stabilization of the PIF4 factor and BES1/BZR1 nuclear accumulation, with a concerted activation of these two families of regulators being essential for growth.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsPlant materials and growth conditionsAll of the plants used in this study were in the Col-0 ecotype. To generate the pPIF4∷PIF4-HA pif4pif5 transgenic lines, a genomic fragment, including a 2.4-kb promoter region and the full-length PIF4 coding sequence without stop codon, was amplified with the PIF4promoter-f and PIF4_YFPr primers and cloned into the pENTRY S/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) vector. The pPIF4∷PIF41A construct was obtained by substituting the NcoI–AgeI fragment of the pPIF4∷PIF4 TOPO plasmid with the corresponding fragment, including the PIF41A mutation. These genomic regions were mobilized by LR clonase into the pGWB13-pPZP destination vector and transformed via Agrobacterium into the pif4pif5 mutant. bes1-D PIF41A plants were generated by crossing the pPIF4∷PIF41A-HA plants into the bes1-D pif4pif5 mutants.Seeds were transferred to vertical MS plates supplemented with the different chemical treatments and grown in darkness or continuous red light for 5–7 d, as specified. Plates were photographed, and the ImageJ software was used to measure the seedlings’ hypocotyl length. Diurnal growth and protein accumulation studies were performed in plants grown in short days (8 h light/16 h dark).Protein interaction assaysThe full-length BIN2, PIF4, and BES1 coding regions were cloned into the pENTRY S/D-TOPO vector for recombination into the yeast and plant expression vectors. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with the GATEWAY-modified pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors (Clontech). Both bait and prey constructs were transformed into AH109 cells and selected on SD-LTHA medium. For pull-down assays, 35S-Met-radiolabeled PIF4 and BES proteins were synthesized with the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with the bound GST and GST-BIN2 proteins. For co-IP studies, extracts of N. benthamiana leaves expressing the BIN2-HA and PIF4-GFP proteins were incubated with anti-HA magnetic beads (μMACS epitope tag, Miltenyi Biotec), and 15 μL (anti-HA) and 35 μL (anti-GFP) of the immunoprecipitated fraction were used for detection of the proteins. The BIN2 and PIF4 coding regions were fused to the N-terminal and C-terminal YFP fragments of the YFN43 and YFC43 vectors and coinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Leaves were observed 2 d after infiltration.In vitro kinase and phosphorylation assaysPIF4-His, PIF41A-His, MBP-BES1, and BIN2-GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione agarose (Clontech), amylose agarose (New England Biolabs), or Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) beads. For in vitro kinase assays, PIF4-His, MBP-BES1, and GST-BIN2 proteins were coincubated with 32Pγ-ATP for 40 min at 37°C. Two micromolar and 20 μM of the BIN2 kinase inhibitor bikinin (Calbiochem) were added to the incubation mix for specific inhibition. Extracts of mock-, BL-, and BRZ-treated seedlings were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with or without CIP (New England Biolabs) to assay for in vivo protein phosphorylation.qRT–PCR gene expression analysisTotal RNA was extracted by using the high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche).

We used a previously described strain [6] that expresses MADD-4 from a pair of bilaterally-symmetrical CAN neurons (Figure 1a–1c). In this strain, muscle arms are redirected towards the lateral source of MADD-4 in an UNC-40-dependent fashion [6]. We also incorporated a madd-4 null mutation in the screening strain as it increases the number of processes directed towards laterally-expressed ectopic MADD-4 and therefore creates a sensitized background (see Figure 1f for example). We screened approximately 22,000 randomly mutagenized genomes and identified 44 penetrant mutants that suppressed redirected muscle arms without obviously diminishing the expression of the transgenes from the CAN neuron. We isolated 9 mutants that are likely new alleles of unc-40 or unc-73 based on their characteristic uncoordinated phenotype and commissural axon guidance defects, and 15 mutants with mutations in madd-2 (not shown). Given our previous characterization of these gene classes [7], [8], we did not pursue these mutants further. Among the remaining 20 mutants, one represented a novel allele of eva-1 that we call tr301. tr301 mutates eva-1's Q86 codon to non-sense. We subsequently found that all known eva-1 alleles are suppressors of muscle arm extension towards ectopic MADD-4 (Figures 1d and 1f). All of the primary and raw data that is displayed in our figures can be found in Dataset S1 and Dataset S2, respectively.We examined the role of eva-1 in normal muscle arm extension towards the midline motor neurons and found a significant reduction compared to wild type (Figure 2a–2c). eva-1 mutants have more dorsal muscle arm defects than ventral muscle arm defects, which is similar to madd-4 mutants [6]. We therefore used double mutant analysis to ask whether EVA-1's role in muscle arm extension might be restricted to the MADD-4 pathway. madd-4 eva-1 double mutants have muscle arm extension defects that are no more severe than the strongest defect of either single mutant alone (Figure 2d). Other allelic combinations were found to yield similar results (not shown). Given that muscle arm extension defects can be more severe than that observed in the madd-4 eva-1 double mutant, this result indicates that EVA-1 and MADD-4 function in the same pathway to guide muscle arms.To further explore the genetic relationship between eva-1 and madd-4, we constructed additional double mutants with other genes known to regulate muscle arm extension. The near absence of muscle arm extension towards the midline in the unc-40 null mutant precludes its use in double mutant analyses to reliably determine whether a second gene product likely functions with UNC-40. However, we previously demonstrated that mutations in unc-6, which do not elicit ventral muscle arm defects on their own, enhance the ventral muscle arm extension defects of the madd-4 null mutant, suggesting that UNC-6 plays a role in attracting muscle arms to the ventral midline in MADD-4's absence [6] (Figure 2d). We found that the unc-6 null mutant also enhances the ventral muscle arm defects of eva-1 (Figure 2d), consistent with the idea that MADD-4 and EVA-1 function together in a pathway that operates in parallel to UNC-6. Of note, we do not examine dorsal muscle arm extension in the unc-6 null mutant backgrounds because these animals lack motor neurons within the dorsal cord, which consequently confounds the interpretation of resulting muscle arm phenotypes.EVA-1 Is a MADD-4 ReceptorPrevious work showed that eva-1 is likely expressed in several tissues, including muscle [14]. We tested whether eva-1 functions cell-autonomously by expressing an EVA-1::CFP fusion protein specifically in the body wall muscles and found that it could rescue the muscle arm defects of eva-1 mutants (Figure 3a). These data indicate that, like UNC-40 [7], EVA-1 functions cell-autonomously to direct muscle arm extension. A systematic analysis of the functional requirement of EVA-1's domains indicate that each of its two predicted galactose-binding lectin-like domains, its transmembrane domain, and its cytoplasmic tail are required for muscle arm extension (Figures 3b and S1a).Given that: i) EVA-1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein that functions in muscle to direct muscle arm extension, and that ii) our genetic analyses indicate that MADD-4 and EVA-1 function in the same pathway, we hypothesized that EVA-1 may be a receptor for MADD-4. We therefore investigated whether MADD-4 might interact physically with EVA-1. We expressed luciferase-tagged MADD-4 and SLT-1 (as a control) from HEK293 cells and collected the conditioned medium (Figure 3c). We overlaid this conditioned medium onto cells expressing FLAG-tagged EVA-1, UNC-40, SAX-3, UNC-5, PAT-2 (α integrin), or control cells not expressing any C. elegans proteins (Figure 3c). We then immunoprecipitated the receptors and measured luciferase activity in the washed immunoprecipitate. We found that MADD-4 had obvious affinity for EVA-1-expressing cells, some affinity for UNC-40 and UNC-5-expressing cells, and negligible affinity for SAX-3 and PAT-2-expressing cells (Figure 3d). By contrast, SLT-1 had obvious affinity for SAX-3-expressing cells, some affinity for EVA-1-expressing cells, and negligible affinity for UNC-40, UNC-5, and PAT-2-expressing cells (Figure 3d). Consistent with the functional necessity of both of EVA-1's galactose-binding lectin-like domains, EVA-1 requires both of these domains to be able to co-immunoprecipitate MADD-4 (Figures 3b and S1b).We next analyzed MADD-4 interactions with EVA-1 and UNC-40 in vivo. When expressed from the nervous system, MADD-4::YFP localization appears restricted to neurons (Figure 3e). However, when expressed from the nervous system of animals that also express EVA-1::CFP in muscles, MADD-4::YFP localizes to the EVA-1::CFP-expressing muscles (Figures 3e–3h and 3j). The ability of muscle-expressed EVA-1::CFP to relocalize neuronally-secreted MADD-4::YFP to muscles is independent of UNC-40 (Figure 3j). Consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation analyses, both of EVA-1's galactose-binding lectin-like domains are required for muscle-expressed EVA-1 to recruit neuronal-expressed MADD-4 (Figures 3b and S1c). We observe negligible recruitment of neuronally-expressed MADD-4::YFP to muscles over-expressing UNC-40 (Figure 3j).In animals expressing MADD-4::YFP from neurons and EVA-1::CFP in muscles, we observe the coincidental vesicularization of YFP and CFP (Figure 3k). When MADD-4::YFP is expressed from the same EVA-1::CFP-expressing muscles, more MADD-4::YFP/EVA-1::CFP vesicles are apparent (Figures 3i and 3k). The increase in vesicles when MADD-4::YFP is expressed from muscles is coincidental with a higher level of expression of MADD-4::YFP in this strain (Figure S2a) and increased proximity to the EVA-1::CFP expressed on muscles. An early endosomal marker (RAB-5) and a recycling endosomal marker (RAB-11) [19] coincide with the MADD-4::YFP/EVA-1::CFP-containing vesicles (Figures S2b and S2c), suggesting that the MADD-4-EVA-1 complex is internalized. These results provide further support for the idea that MADD-4 interacts with EVA-1 in vivo. We observe negligible vesicularization of MADD-4::YFP with UNC-40::CFP (Figures 3k and 3l). Together, our genetic, transgenic, cell biological, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses support a model whereby EVA-1 acts as a receptor for MADD-4.EVA-1 Functions within an UNC-40 ComplexEVA-1 and UNC-40 are both required for muscle arm extension towards MADD-4 (Figure 1f). We therefore hypothesized that the two transmembrane proteins might function in a co-receptor complex to mediate MADD-4 activity. To investigate this possibility, we first examined whether transgenic EVA-1 and UNC-40 co-localize with one another in muscle cells and found that they do (Figure 4a). Of note, the absence of EVA-1 does not affect the subcellular localization UNC-40 and vice versa (Figure S3a and S3b).Next, we investigated whether EVA-1 and UNC-40 could be found in the same complex. We expressed functional epitope-tagged EVA-1 and UNC-40 in C. elegans muscles and tested whether they co-immunoprecipitate and found that they do (Figure 4b). By contrast, neither UNC-40 nor EVA-1 co-immunoprecipitates with PAT-2, a negative control (Figures S3c and S3d). A systematic analysis of EVA-1 domains revealed that only the alteration of EVA-1's transmembrane domain disrupts its ability to co-immunoprecipitate UNC-40; swapping EVA-1's transmembrane domain for that of PAT-2's abolishes the co-immunoprecipitation of EVA-1 and UNC-40 (Figures 4b and 3b). The version of EVA-1 with its transmembrane domain swapped for that of PAT-2 cannot rescue the muscle arm defects of the eva-1 null mutant (Figure 3b and S1a), despite being subcellularly localized to the plasma membrane of muscles, and being able to recruit neuronally-secreted MADD-4::YFP to muscles (Figures 3b and S1c). This suggests that the interaction between EVA-1 and UNC-40 is functionally relevant. Together, these results support the idea that EVA-1 functions within an UNC-40 complex.UNC-6 Interferes with UNC-40's Interaction with MADD-4UNC-40 localizes to the tips of muscle arms [7], is required for muscle arm extension towards normal and ectopic sources of MADD-4 (Figure 1f) [6], and can co-immunoprecipitate MADD-4 when expressed from HEK293 cells (Figure 3d). However, we did not observe an obvious in vivo association between MADD-4::YFP and muscle-expressed UNC-40::CFP in worms (Figures 3j–3l). Given that UNC-6 is UNC-40's canonical ligand, we tested the idea that MADD-4's ability to interact with UNC-40 is restricted by UNC-6. Upon genetic removal of UNC-6, we observed an obvious increase in the vesicularization of muscle-expressed UNC-40::CFP by MADD-4::YFP (Figures 3k and 3m), suggesting that MADD-4 and UNC-40 are capable of interacting in vivo. We also tested whether UNC-6 also interferes with MADD-4's interaction with HEK293-expressed UNC-40 in culture and found that it did (Figure 5a). Together, these results suggest that UNC-40 can serve as a MADD-4 receptor and that UNC-6 can interfere with the MADD-4-UNC-40 interaction.EVA-1 Sensitizes UNC-40 to the MADD-4 CueAbove, we demonstrated that: i) EVA-1 and UNC-40 are needed for muscle arm extension towards endogenous and ectopic sources of MADD-4; ii) EVA-1 likely functions within an UNC-40 co-receptor complex; iii) In the absence of MADD-4, UNC-6 has demonstrable activity in attracting muscle arms to the ventral nerve cord; and iv) UNC-6 is capable of interfering with the MADD-4-UNC-40 interaction. Together, these observations led us to hypothesize that EVA-1's role might be to counteract the UNC-6 interference by sensitizing UNC-40 to the MADD-4 cue. We tested this hypothesis in several ways.First, we returned to our assay in which we redirect arms laterally by ectopically-expressing MADD-4 from the CAN neuron (Figure 1). If EVA-1's role in mediating MADD-4 attraction is to counteract UNC-6 interference, then the reason why EVA-1's absence suppresses muscle arm extension towards CAN-expressed MADD-4 is because ventral sources of UNC-6 are interfering with UNC-40-mediated attraction to the CAN-expressed MADD-4. If true, then removal of UNC-6 should restore muscle arm extension towards CAN-expressed MADD-4 in the eva-1 null mutant background. Indeed, we observed restoration of lateral muscle arm extension towards ectopic MADD-4 in the eva-1; unc-6 double null mutants (Figures 1e and 1f). Lateral muscle arm extension remains dependent on UNC-40 in the eva-1; unc-6 double mutants (Figure 1f). These observations support the model whereby EVA-1 sensitizes UNC-40 to MADD-4 and this sensitization is necessary to counteract UNC-6's interference.Next, we investigated whether our model holds true for muscle arms that extend towards the endogenous source of MADD-4 at the ventral nerve cord. We already knew that genetic removal of UNC-6 does not restore muscle arm extension towards the ventral nerve cord in eva-1 null mutants and instead enhances the defect (Figure 2d). Although this provides evidence that UNC-6 and EVA-1 function in parallel to guide arms to the ventral cord, this observation is seemingly incongruent with the idea that UNC-6 interferes with the MADD-4 UNC-40 interaction. However, we reasoned that endogenous levels of MADD-4 from the ventral nerve cord might not be high enough to engage UNC-40 without EVA-1 present on the body wall muscle cell that we normally study, which is called ventral left muscle number 11 (VL11) ([4] and Figure 2b). Indeed, when more MADD-4 is expressed from the nervous system (from the trIs66 transgenic array), the VL11 muscle arm defects of the eva-1 unc-6 double null mutant are rescued (Figure 2d). In addition, we examined muscle arm extension from a muscle (VL19) that is located ∼10 micrometers closer to the ventral nerve cord than VL11 (Figure 2e) and is consequently likely to encounter more endogenous MADD-4. We found that the pattern of genetic interactions exhibited by VL19 is the same as the pattern that we uncovered in the ectopic assay; the genetic removal of UNC-6 suppresses the muscle arm defects of the eva-1 null mutant (Figure 2f). Hence, EVA-1 counteracts UNC-6's interference of UNC-40-mediated guidance towards MADD-4 from either ectopic or endogenous sources.Notably, in animals that lack UNC-6, endogenous MADD-4 is sufficient to attract muscle arms from the muscle that is closer to it (VL19), but requires EVA-1 to attract muscle arms from the muscle that is further from it (VL11) (Figures 2d–2f). This suggests that EVA-1's ability to sensitize UNC-40 to MADD-4 is independent of UNC-6.EVA-1 Is Sufficient to Sensitize UNC-40 to MADD-4 in the Background of UNC-6Above, we demonstrated that EVA-1 is necessary to facilitate UNC-40 sensitivity to MADD-4, and that UNC-40's enhanced sensitivity to MADD-4 is especially important in the presence of UNC-6. We took two approaches to determine whether EVA-1 is also sufficient for this activity. First, we tested whether EVA-1 can counteract UNC-6's interference of the MADD-4-UNC-40 interaction that we observed in cell culture. Upon co-expressing EVA-1 with UNC-40 in HEK293 cells, we are indeed able to counteract UNC-6's interference of UNC-40's interaction with MADD-4 (Figure 5a).Next, we examined EVA-1's ability to modulate an UNC-40-dependent cell migration that normally doesn't require EVA-1. The expansion of the bi-lobed somatic gonad during C. elegans development is led by the migratory distal tip cell at the leading edge of each gonad lobe [20]. The distal tip cell leads a ventral to dorsal gonad expansion via the expression of UNC-40 and UNC-5 co-receptors that mediate a repulsive migration away from the ventral source of UNC-6 (Figure 5b). Genetic removal of any of these components results in a gonad that often fails to reach the dorsal body wall and instead expands ventrally, which in turn, results in a white patch on the animal's ventral side (Figures 5b–5d). EVA-1 is not obviously expressed in the distal tip cells [14], and loss of EVA-1 has no consequence on the migration of the distal tip cell (Figures 5e and S4-data point 3), suggesting that EVA-1 plays no major role in distal tip cell migration. Given that the distal tip cells express UNC-40 [11], we tested whether dorsally-expressed MADD-4 could rescue the distal tip cell migration defect of the netrin pathway mutants. If our model of EVA-1/UNC-40/MADD-4/UNC-6 interactions are true, then dorsal expression of MADD-4 should only be able to rescue distal tip cell migration defects in the absence of UNC-6. Indeed, dorsally-expressed MADD-4 can significantly rescue the distal tip cell migration defects of animals that lack UNC-6 (Figures 5e and S4-data points 9 and 10), but not those that lack UNC-40 or UNC-5 (Figures 5e and S4- data points 7 and 8, and columns 13 and 16, respectively). However, expressing EVA-1 ectopically in the distal tip cell of unc-5 mutants allows the migrating cell to respond to dorsally-expressed MADD-4 despite the presence of endogenous UNC-6 (Figures 5e and S4- data points 13–18). As expected, the ability of distal tip cell-expressed EVA-1 to confer sensitivity to the dorsally-expressed MADD-4 cue is dependent on UNC-40 (Figures 5e and S4- data points 19–22). Together, our results indicate that EVA-1 is both necessary and sufficient to sensitize UNC-40 to the MADD-4 cue. Furthermore, this enhanced sensitivity is necessary and sufficient to overcome UNC-6's interference of the UNC-40-mediated attraction towards MADD-4.EVA-1 and UNC-40 Direct Axon Extension towards MADD-4We were curious to know whether EVA-1 might play a similar role in guiding axons towards MADD-4 as it does in guiding muscle arms. We previously demonstrated that a madd-4 null mutation can enhance the AVM mechanosensory axon guidance defects of a slt-1 or unc-6 null mutant, but not those of an unc-40 null mutant [6] (Figures 6a–6d). Here, we found that madd-4 also failed to enhance the AVM guidance defects of an eva-1 mutant (Figure 6e), suggesting that EVA-1 and UNC-40 may function together in a third pathway that is independent of SLT-1 and UNC-6 to mediate attraction towards MADD-4. Note that the AVM guidance defects reported in Figure 6e are invariably lateral extensions like that shown in Figure 6c.We next examined the requirement for these factors in guiding the AVM axon towards heightened MADD-4 expression from the dorsal muscles, which attracts the AVM axon from its normal ventral trajectory to lateral and dorsal trajectories [6] (Figures 6c and 6d). Upon considering only the lateral guidance errors, the eva-1 null is enhanced by the unc-40 null, and not enhanced by the slt-1 null (Figure 6f). These interactions are entirely consistent with a previous report that shows that EVA-1 can act as SAX-3's co-receptor for the SLT-1 ligand and that this pathway acts in parallel to one that includes UNC-40 and UNC-6 [14].A distinct set of relationships between EVA-1, UNC-40, UNC-6 and SLT-1 become evident upon considering only the dorsal guidance errors of the AVM axon like that shown in Figure 6d. We previously found that unc-40 is required for the dorsal redirection of the AVM axon towards dorsally-expressed MADD-4 [6]. We found that eva-1 is also required for this dorsal redirection and that the unc-40 eva-1 double mutant is as compromised in dorsal redirection of the AVM axon as the single unc-40 mutant (Figure 6g). By contrast, eliminating the dorsal repulsive cue (SLT-1) or the ventral attractive cue (UNC-6) dramatically enhances AVM axon extension towards dorsally-expressed MADD-4 [6] (Figure 6g). These results are consistent with the idea that EVA-1 also functions with UNC-40 in a pathway that is distinct from SLT-1 and UNC-6 to mediate the extension of the AVM axon towards MADD-4.Finally, we tested whether UNC-6 interferes with the UNC-40-mediated AVM axon extension towards MADD-4, and concurrently, whether EVA-1 counteracts UNC-6's interference. Indeed, we found that AVM axon guidance towards dorsally-expressed MADD-4 is suppressed in animals lacking EVA-1, but is restored in these eva-1 null mutants upon removing UNC-6 (Figure 6g). We tested two other allelic combinations of eva-1 and unc-6 and found similar results (not shown). Genetic removal of UNC-40 in the background of the eva-1; unc-6 double reduces AVM axon attraction to the levels seen in the eva-1 single mutant, demonstrating that guidance towards MADD-4 remains dependent on UNC-40 in the absence of EVA-1 and UNC-6 (Figure 6g). As a control, we tested whether genetic removal of SLT-1 is able to restore AVM axon guidance towards dorsally-expressed MADD-4 in the eva-1 mutant background and found that it cannot (Figure 6g). These results show that UNC-6 interferes with UNC-40's interaction with MADD-4 with not only in the context of muscle arm extension, but during axon guidance as well. In both cell types, EVA-1's ability to sensitize UNC-40 to MADD-4 is needed to overcome UNC-6's interference of the UNC-40-MADD-4 interaction.", "Materials and Methods": "Materials and MethodsNematode Strains, Counts, and MicroscopyAll strains were cultured and maintained at 20°C according to standard protocol [21]. All muscle arm counts were performed in the background of the chromosomally integrated transgenic array trIs30I or trIs70II, both of which express membrane-anchored YFP from the him-4 promoter in select distal body wall muscles along with other markers of commissural motor axons [4]. See below for details on the trIs integrated transgenes. For transgenic strains, muscle arms were visualized either in the background of trIs30I or trIs70II, or directly from fluorescence associated with the expression of the transgenic array. To visualize YFP-tagged proteins, we used the Leica 513867 filter set; to visualize CFP-tagged proteins, we used the Leica 513866 filter set; to visualize RFPs, we used Leica's 513868 filter set. Muscle arms were counted as previously described [4]. AVMs and PVMs were visualized using the fluorescent reporter background muIs32II [22]. The direction of axon extension of 50 AVMs and PVMs from at least three separate populations of the same strain was counted from living animals on standard culture plates using an epifluorescent MZ16 dissection scope (Leica Inc.) with a 2× objective. Distal tip cell migration defects were scored by observing for the presence of anterior and posterior ventral white patches (relative to the vulva) from at least three separate populations of 50 living animals of the same strain. Distal tip cell migration defects were visualized using an epifluorescent MZ16 dissection scope (Leica Inc.) with a 2× objective. Redirected muscle arms were counted from 20 left and right sides of worms for each strain. All counts of muscle arms are from worms anaesthetized with 2–10 mM levamisole (Sigma) in M9 solution [23] and photographed as previously described [4]. During strain construction, genotypes like madd-4(ok2862) or slt-1(ok255), which cannot be followed using obvious behavioral phenotypes, were instead followed using PCR and/or sequence of 5 or more individual progeny from a single cloned animal.All statistical analyses were performed using a one-tailed, two-sample equal variance Student's t-test. We used a one-tailed test because for all analyses we hypothesized that the effect would be unidirectional. For example, when comparing muscle arm extension in mutants with wild type worms, we hypothesize that the mutant mean would be smaller than the wild type mean. Lastly, we chose a test that compared two independent samples of equal variance because all counts performed fall under normal distributions.A Forward Genetic Screen for Mutants that Suppress Muscle Arm Redirection towards CAN-Expressed MADD-4A forward genetic screen for mutants that suppress muscle arm redirection towards CAN-expressed MADD-4 was performed by incubating a mixed stage population of RP1912 madd-4(ok2854); trIs70II; trIs63X animals in 50 µM ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 4 hours. trIs63 drives expression from the ceh-23 promoter in the bisymmetrical pair of CAN neurons that extend axons along the lateral length of the worm. See below for details on the trIs integrated transgenes. Resulting F1s were synchronized as L1s [23] and grown on 6 cm plates (∼3000 per plate) for 3 days, and then transferred manually to each well of a 24-well plate. F2 progeny were screened 4–7 days later for mutants with defects in redirected muscle arm extensions using a Leica MZFLIII epiflourescence dissection microscope with a 2× objective. A total of ∼17,500 haploid genomes were screened clonally as described, and a further ∼2,400 haploid genomes were screened non-clonally by batch screening of F2 progeny. 51 suppressor mutants were isolated from these screens.Molecular Biology and TransgenicsThe following chromosomally-integrated transgenic arrays were made using standard techniques [24], [25] and are available either from the C. elegans Genetic Centre or from us: trIs30[pPRRF138.2(him-4p::Mb::YFP)(10 ng/ul); pPRZL44(hmr-1 bp::DsRed2)(80 ng/ul); pPR2.1(unc-129nsp::DsRed2)(40 ng/ul)]I; trIs34[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(2 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]X; trIs41[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(125 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]II; trIs63[pPRGS630(ceh-23p::MADD-4B::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS629(ceh-23p::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs65[pPRGS655(ceh-23p::MADD-4B::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS629(ceh-23p::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]; trIs66[pPRGS628(unc-119p::MADD-4B::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs69[pPRKC404(him-4p::PAT-2::CFP)(100 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]; trIs70[pPRZL138.2(him-4p::Mb::YFP)(5 ng/ul); pPR16(unc-25p::CFP)(20 ng/ul); pKS(75 ng/ul)]II; trIs73[pPRKC638.2(him-4p::UNC-40::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(100 ng/ul)]; trIs77[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]; trIs78[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]IV; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)]. The constructs were built using standard protocols. Note that expression of MADD-4 and EVA-1 at relatively high concentrations can induce dominant muscle arm extension defects.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis500 µL of mixed stage packed worms were washed thrice with M9 solution and once with PBS, and re-suspended in 1 mL ice cold solubilization buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2.5 µg/ml Pepstatin-A, 10 mM NaF and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) per 10 ml of solution). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and lysed through three cycles of flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, partial thawing and sonnication for 5 seconds at 8 Watts. Next, the samples were incubated at 4°C with agitation for 30 minutes and then centrifuged (13000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C). A BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure the protein concentration in the supernatant. 6 mg/ml of protein lysate was incubated with either 30 µl of packed Antiflag M2 agarose coupled antibody (Sigma) or 30 µl of packed Protein A/G agarose beads (SantaCruz) along with 2–4 µg of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (GenScript) for 3 hrs with agitation at 4°C. The agarose beads were centrifuged and washed 5 times with 1 ml of cold solubilization buffer. Samples were resuspended in 2× Laemlli buffer and analyzed by western blot. The FLAG immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Genscript), and the GFP immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (SantaCruz).Normalization of luciferase signal to protein level expression was performed by first subtracting control luciferase signal values from experimental luciferase signal values to obtain relative luciferase signal values. Next, protein level expression was measured by quantifying the number of pixels in a given protein band as visualized on film, using the publicly available software ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Normalized relative luciferase signal was obtained by expressing relative luciferase signal values as a fraction of protein level expression.The integrated transgenes used in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are as follows: trIs41[pPRKC294(him-4p::UNC-40::YFP)(125 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]II; trIs69[pPRKC404(him-4p::PAT-2::CFP)(100 ng/ul); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))(100 ng/ul)]; trIs73[pPRKC638.2(him-4p::UNC-40::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(100 ng/ul)]; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)].The ability of EVA-1 truncations to co-immunoprecipitate UNC-40 was performed by establishing extrachromosomal transgenes in the trIs41 integrated strain, and by following the aforementioned co-immunoprecipitation protocol: pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry), pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ866(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL1+2)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ867(him-4p::EVA-1(CYTO)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ868(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL1)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRJZ869(him-4p::EVA-1(GAL2)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP), pPRAVS927.5(him-4p::EVA-1(PAT-2-TM)::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP). EVA-1 truncation constructs were all injected at 10 ng/ul together with pPRGS382 at 2 ng/ul.For protein level analysis of MADD-4 transgenes, total protein was obtained by sonnication and flash freezing worm lysates of respective integrated strains as described above. 20 ul containing 50 ng of total protein in 2× Laemmli sample buffer was analyzed by western blot. Blots were analyzed using rabbit anti-MADD-4 antibodies (which we made in conjunction with Genscript Inc. by injecting rabbits with MADD-4 peptides) and mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma) for the loading control.HEK293T Cell Surface Binding ExperimentsThe constructs for expressing the five receptors in HEK293T cells are as follows: pPRGS861(CMV8-SS::3XFLAG::EVA-1); pPRGS831(CMV8-SS::3XFLAG::UNC-5(no death domain- see [26]; pPRGS757(pCDNA3-SS::3XFLAG::PAT-2). CMV3-SS:SAX-3::3XFLAG and CMV3-SS::3XFLAG::UNC-40 were obtained from Joe Culotti [14]. The constructs for expressing the MADD-4B and SLT-1 from HEK293T cells are as follows: pPRGS827(pCDNA3-SS::HA::MADD-4B::Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)); and pPRGS854(pCDNA3-SS::HA::SLT-1::Gluc)). All expression plasmids have been sequence verified.HEK293T cells were maintained and transfected in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (DMEM-10% FBS). All transfections were performed using JetPrime transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection). Cell surface Gaussia luciferase binding assays were performed as previously reported [27].To obtain concentrated conditioned culture media containing HA::MADD-4B::Gluc or Gluc::SLT-1::HA, 10 ug of respective expression plasmid was transfected into HEK293T cells, and culture media was changed to DMEM-0.2% FBS. After 24 hours of culture, the conditioned media was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and subsequently concentrated 10 times using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). When necessary, ligands were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells by using an anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) and analyzed by western blot using rabbit anti-HA antibodies (Sigma).For the cell surface binding assays, 2 ug of individual plasmids expressing the various C. elegans receptors (previously described) were transfected into HEK293T cells. 48 hours post-transfection, culture media was removed and cells were incubated with concentrated conditioned media for 4 hours at 4°C. Cells were then harvested in a solution containing PBS, 0.2% BSA and protease inhibitors (Roche), and lysed in TNTE buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. C. elegans receptors were immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (SIGMA), and were washed once in lysis buffer, and then in TNTE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor; five times for HA::MADD-4B::Gluc and 3 times for Gluc::SLT-1::HA ligands. One third of the immunoprecipitate was taken for Gaussia luciferase assays by using the BioLux Kit (NEB) and MicroLumat Plus LB96V luminometer (BERTHOLD). Remainder of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blot using rabbit anti-Flag antibodies (NEB).MADD-4-EVA-1 Interaction Analysis In Vivo To assay the ability of MADD-4::YFP (from the trIs66 array) to localize to EVA-1::CFP expressing muscles (from the trIs89 array), transgenic muscles were first identified by fluorescence under the CFP filter, and then re-examined under the YFP filter for presence of MADD-4::YFP. To assay the presence of MADD-4/EVA-1 vesicles, muscles were first identified for co-expression of both MADD-4::YFP (from the trIs78 array) and EVA-1::CFP (from the trIs89 array). These muscles were then examined for the presence of vesicles and were considered a positive score if containing more than two vesicles.Colocalization studies between MADD-4/EVA-1 vesicles and endosomal markers were performed by creating strains that harbor trIs89, trIs78 and either huIs91 or huIs97. huIs91 is a marker for early endosomes and huIs97 is a marker for recycling endosomes; both transgenes were obtained from Rik Korswagen.Integrated transgenes used in these colocalization studies are as follows: trIs66[pPRGS628(unc-119p::MADD-4B::MYC::3XFLAG::YFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(5 ng/ul)]X; trIs78[pPRGS698(unc-129msp::MADD-4A::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS699(unc-129msp::MADD-4B::YFP)(12.5 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul)]IV; trIs89[pPRKC793(him-4p::EVA-1::MYC::3XFLAG::CFP)(50 ng/ul); pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul); pKS(50 ng/ul)]; huIs91[myo-3p::mCherry::RAB-5]; huIs97[myo-3p::mCherry::RAB-11]Test of EVA-1 Sufficiency in Guiding Distal Tip Cells towards MADD-4To test sufficiency of EVA-1, we used the emb-9 promoter similar to previous work [28] to drive EVA-1 expression in the distal tip cells from an extra-chromosomal array, which was first established in N2 wild type animals. Arrays were then crossed into RP2071 unc-5(e53) trIs78IV; trIs30I to generate unc-5(e53) trIs78IV; trIs30I; trEx948 #1(or#2)[pPRKC948(emb-9p::EVA-1::CFP)(10 ng/ul); pPRGS365(myo-2p::CFP)(5 ng/ul)] lines. Distal tip cell migration defects were scored as previously described only in transgenic animals. RNAi-by-feeding experiments were performed as previously reported [29].Characterizing Sub-cellular Localization of EVA-1 and UNC-40Localization of EVA-1::CFP and UNC-40::YFP were examined under 63× magnification. Muscle expressed EVA-1::CFP was from an extrachromosomal array harboring pPRGS394(him-4p::EVA-1::CFP)(10 ng/ul) and pPRGS382(myo-2p::mCherry)(2 ng/ul). Muscle expressed UNC-40::YFP came from the trIs34 transgene."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 20333, "tokens": 3081, "source": "regular"}, "Materials and Methods": {"chars": 14006, "tokens": 1761, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "PLoS Genetics", "year": "2014", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1004521", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

The BW25113 strain of E. coli was chosen for this aspect of the study as it contains a full complement of multidrug efflux proteins and has been used before for investigations into MdtM function (Tal and Schuldiner, 2009; Holdsworth and Law, 2012a, b; 2013). MICs of cholate and deoxycholate for E. coli BW25113 single-deletion mutants that are dysfunctional with respect to tripartite EmrAB–TolC and AcrAB–TolC efflux activity were also determined to permit a comparison of the contribution of each of those transporters to bile salt resistance. Additionally, the effect of deleting the outer membrane porin ompF in the BW25113 strain was tested.As shown in Table 1, deletion of mdtM resulted in a phenotype that was twofold more susceptible to cholate and fourfold more susceptible to deoxycholate than wild-type E. coli BW25113. Not surprisingly, considering the especially significant role of the tripartite efflux system AcrAB–TolC in bile salt resistance in E. coli (Ma et al., 1995; Thanassi et al., 1997), deletion of chromosomal acrB resulted in a bile salt-hypersensitive phenotype with cholate and deoxycholate MICs decreased from 128 to 8 mg ml−1 and from 128 to < 1 mg ml−1 respectively. The difference in sensitivity to each bile salt is a consequence of their hydrophobicity (which is highest for deoxycholate), and hence, with the ability of each to diffuse across the bacterial membrane system and into the cell cytoplasm (Kamp et al., 1993). The ability of the unconjugated bile salts to diffuse freely across the bacterial membranes was further illustrated by the MICs determined in the ΔompF mutant; deletion of OmpF porin in the BW25113 strain had no effect on bile salt resistance.In contrast to the dramatic effect that deletion of chromosomal acrB had on bile salt resistance, the absence of a functional MFS-type EmrAB–TolC tripartite efflux system had negligible effect on cholate resistance, and resistance to deoxycholate decreased only twofold. The apparent lack of protection against cholate by a system that reportedly plays a significant role in bile salt resistance (Thanassi et al., 1997; Li and Nikaido, 2004) is not unexpected because the AcrAB–TolC and EmrAB–TolC tripartite pumps work in parallel and not in series, and therefore their effect is additive and not multiplicative (Lee et al., 2000). As such, the contribution of EmrAB–TolC is much smaller as compared to AcrAB–TolC and the effect of emrB deletion is seen only in the background of dysfunctional AcrAB–TolC (Thanassi et al., 1997).The MIC determinations suggest that, although not essential, the mdtM gene product makes a significant contribution to both cholate and deoxycholate resistance in E. coli. Analysis of mdtM transcript levels revealed that they are not upregulated upon bile salt challenge and that there was no statistically significant change in mdtM transcription between cholate-treated versus untreated control E. coli, relative to a 16S rRNA reference (data not shown). This implies that the ‘housekeeping’ levels of MdtM present in the membrane at the onset of bile salt challenge are sufficient to contribute effectively to resistance.Expression of plasmidic mdtM recovers a bile salt-resistant phenotypeTo test further the contribution of mdtM to bile salt resistance, ΔmdtM cells were transformed with an arabinose-inducible multicopy plasmid (pMdtM) that encoded wild-type MdtM, and the ability of overexpressed transporter to protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of cholate and deoxycholate was determined by growth inhibition assays that measured the concentration of bile salt required to inhibit cell growth by 50% of that measured in the absence of the substrate (the IC50 value) (Soothill et al., 1992). ΔmdtM cells that overproduced dysfunctional MdtM from the pD22A plasmid acted as a control (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a). Assays were performed in LB liquid media buffered to two different pH values (7.2 and 6.0) that mirror the pH conditions experienced by enteric bacteria as they negotiate the mammalian intestine (Rune and Viskum, 1969; McDougall et al., 1993).As shown in Fig. 1A–D, deletion of chromosomal mdtM resulted in a phenotype that was clearly more susceptible to bile salts than wild-type cells. The data also revealed the BW25113 strain of E. coli to be less resistant to deoxycholate than to cholate; at the slightly alkaline pH of 7.2, the IC50 value of wild-type BW25113 for cholate was 35.6 ± 1.8 mM, whereas an IC50 of 28.2 ± 1.2 mM was calculated for the same cell type grown in the presence of deoxycholate (Fig. 1A and B); these IC50 values are about threefold and fourfold greater, respectively, than the IC50 values (14.6 ± 3.6 mM for cholate, and 7.5 ± 1.1 mM for deoxycholate) calculated for ΔmdtM single-deletion mutant cells grown under the same conditions. However, complementation of ΔmdtM cells with plasmidic mdtM (pMdtM) recovered a phenotype with greater than wild-type levels of resistance to each bile salt. In contrast, ΔmdtM control cells that overexpressed dysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant transporter from a multicopy plasmid (pD22A) displayed no resurrection of bile-salt resistance.Comparison of the IC50 data also revealed that susceptibility of wild-type cells to both bile salts was enhanced at acidic pH, with IC50 values of 22.3 ± 1.1 mM and 18.4 ± 1.6 mM for cholate and deoxycholate, respectively, for cells grown at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1C and D). The IC50 values of the ΔmdtM mutant cells and those that overexpressed dysfunctional MdtM at this pH, however, were very similar to those calculated for the same cells grown at pH 7.2. Again, overexpression by ΔmdtM cells of functional MdtM from a multicopy plasmid rescued a bile salt-resistant phenotype. In all cases, statistical analysis of the IC50 data using a two-tailed Student’s t-test confirmed that the differences in susceptibility observed between wild-type and ΔmdtM mutant cells to the bile salts under test were significant (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis of dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent-solubilized cytoplasmic membranes from ΔmdtM cells transformed with pMdtM or pD22A provided evidence that the observed differences in susceptibility to the bile salts did not originate from differences in the expression of recombinant transporter; the levels of wild-type MdtM and dysfunctional D22A protein production in the ΔmdtM transformants grown at pH 7.2 and pH 6.0 were similar (Fig. S1A).MdtM acts synergistically with AcrAB–TolC to efflux bile saltsEvidence suggests that single-component membrane transporters can interact synergistically with tripartite RND-type proteins to form a dual-stage efflux mechanism that provides multiplicative effects on drug resistance (Lee et al., 2000). To test if interplay between MdtM and AcrAB–TolC holds for efflux of bile salts, and also if MdtM is capable of functioning unilaterally in bile salt efflux, we performed growth assays that measured the IC50 of cholate and deoxycholate for BW25113 ΔacrB cells transformed with plasmidic DNA encoding wild-type MdtM or, as a control, the dysfunctional D22A mutant (Fig. 1E–H). Levels of overproduction of wild-type and mutant MdtM protein were similar at both pH values investigated, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. S1B).Absence of functional AcrAB–TolC and MdtM efflux systems resulted in cells that were hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effects of each bile salt, with IC50 values that were at least an order of magnitude smaller than the IC50s of wild-type cells (Fig. 1E–H). Complementation of ΔacrB cells with pMdtM recovered a phenotype that was less susceptible; at pH 7.2, the IC50 values of these cells for cholate and deoxycholate were 12.5 ± 2.1 mM and 9.7 ± 1.2 mM, respectively (Fig. 1E and F), and at pH 6.0 the corresponding IC50 values were 8.7 ± 0.9 mM and 6.8 ± 0.9 mM (Fig. 1G and H). Although these IC50 values were approximately four- to fivefold greater than those of the ΔacrB mutant transformed with pD22A (Fig. 1E–H), they were similar to those measured for the chromosomal mdtM-deletion mutant under the same conditions (Fig. 1A–D). The inability of ΔacrB cells that overproduced MdtM to recover the levels of cholate and deoxycholate resistance observed in wild-type cells highlights the major role in efflux played by AcrAB–TolC and suggests that, even though MdtM clearly possesses capacity to function independently in bile salt resistance, a functional synergism between MdtM and AcrAB–TolC provides greater levels of resistance.Bile salts compete with other antimicrobials for MdtM-mediated effluxAlthough the results of growth inhibition assays implicated the mdtM gene product in protecting cells from bile salt cytotoxicity, they did not provide any direct evidence that MdtM mediates bile salt efflux. To provide initial confirmation of this, the effect of the addition of sodium cholate and sodium deoxycholate on the ethidium bromide (EtBr) efflux activity of MdtM was measured by whole-cell fluorescence assays that used E. coli UTL2 outer permeability mutant cells transformed with plasmidic MdtM. These assays were performed at pH 6.0 to abrogate any potential interference by the electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM that is apparent at pH values > 7.0 (Holdsworth and Law, 2013).In the positive control assay, performed in a buffer system that contained no added bile salt, addition of glucose to energize cells that expressed wild-type MdtM resulted in a rapid decrease in the fluorescence signal as the transporter actively extruded EtBr from the cell against its concentration gradient (Fig. 2, trace A). Subsequent addition of the ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) caused the fluorescence signal to rise again, indicating that the observed EtBr efflux was driven by the electrochemical gradient. Negative control cells that expressed dysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant from a multicopy plasmid were incapable of mediating any significant EtBr efflux (Fig. 2, trace E). To ensure that any observed inhibition of EtBr efflux was not due to competition by the sodium counterions of each added bile salt, transport experiments were performed with 3.0 mM NaCl added to the system (Fig. 2, trace B). Incubation of cells that overexpressed wild-type MdtM with sodium cholate or sodium deoxycholate at a final concentration of 3.0 mM prior to addition of glucose caused a dramatic decrease in the magnitude of the observed fluorescence signal that was indicative of inhibition of MdtM-mediated EtBr efflux by the bile salts (Fig. 2, traces C and D respectively). Subsequent collapse of the membrane potential by addition of CCCP resulted in a dequench of the fluorescence signal and suggested that detergent activity of the bile salts had not compromised inner membrane integrity. When re-energized, the same cells retained capacity to efflux EtBr (Fig. S2), adding further support to our contention that the reduction in EtBr transport activity observed in bile salt-treated cells was due to competition between the different substrates for MdtM and not due to perturbation of the cell membrane. In contrast, the effects of membrane disruption on EtBr transport were readily apparent from the results of control assays performed on cells treated with DDM detergent, a non-substrate of MdtM. In this case, addition of DDM to the assay mixture resulted in an immediate rise in the fluorescence signal as EtBr leaked back into the cell through the detergent-compromised membrane (Fig. S2).MdtM binds cholate and deoxycholate at micromolar concentrationsTo confirm that MdtM was capable of binding bile salts, the binding of cholate and deoxycholate to purified transporter in dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) detergent solution at pH 6.0 and pH 7.2 was determined using intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence with excitation at 295 nm. Sequential addition of bile salt aliquots to purified protein in DDM solution resulted in a concentration-dependent quenching of the Trp fluorescence emission signal without shifting the λmax at 335 nm, suggesting that the quench resulted from a specific interaction between bile salt and the MdtM substrate-binding pocket, and that one or more Trp residues acted as reporters for binding. Threading of the MdtM primary sequence onto the 3-D crystal structure of the closely related E. coli MFS multidrug transporter EmrD (Yin et al., 2006) proposed only one of the nine Trp residues of MdtM, Trp309, as being located near the putative binding pocket of the transporter and, therefore, likely to be involved in the bile salt-induced quenching. Fluorescence measurements performed on Trp309Phe (W309F) and Trp309Ala (W309A) MdtM mutants supported this contention, with quenching induced by bile salt in both mutants severely reduced compared to that of the wild-type transporter and due probably to a non-specific interaction with the protein (Fig. S3).Analysis of the binding data revealed that MdtM possessed micromolar affinity for the bile salts. The protein displayed greater affinity for cholate than deoxycholate and, as pH decreased, there was a concomitant decrease in binding affinity (Fig. 3). There was also a substrate- and pH-dependent variability in the magnitude of the Trp fluorescence quench, which ranged from about 25% in the presence of cholate at pH 7.2 (Fig. 3A) to about 12% in the presence of deoxycholate at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3D). At pH 7.2, the apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) of MdtM for cholate was 24 ± 6 μM (Fig. 3A), whereas the protein appeared to bind deoxycholate about sevenfold less tight with a Kdapp of 176 ± 20 μM (Fig. 3B). Acidic pH decreased the affinity of MdtM for both bile salts; at pH 6.0 the Kdapp values for cholate and deoxycholate were 52 ± 5 μM (Fig. 3C) and 227 ± 4 μM (Fig. 3D) respectively. To ensure the observed increase in Kdapp at acidic pH was not due to loss of structural integrity of the protein, the CD spectrum of purified transporter in DDM detergent solution at pH 6.0 and pH 7.2 was measured. Figure S4 illustrates the similarity in the CD spectra of MdtM at both pH values. The spectra are superimposable down to ∼ 196 nm, suggesting that there were no gross structural changes in the secondary structure of the protein following the change in pH. Below 196 nm there was a slight (< 10%) decrease in ellipticity in the spectrum of the transporter at the acidic pH (Fig. S4, black trace). The secondary structure estimates at each pH, however, were in close agreement (Table 2).MdtM mediates a bile salt/H+ exchange driven by the electrochemical gradientThe binding affinity assays revealed that MdtM is capable of binding cholate and deoxycholate. However, evidence of binding cannot be construed as evidence of subsequent efflux. To show experimentally that MdtM can actively mediate bile salt/H+ antiport across the cytoplasmic membrane, transport assays on inverted membrane vesicles generated from antiporter-deficient E. coli TO114 cells that overproduced wild-type transporter were performed by measuring the fluorescence dequenching of the pH-sensitive fluorophore acridine orange upon addition of bile salts to the assay mixture (Figs 4 and S5). The presence of RND-type efflux proteins in the TO114 cells was not a confounding factor in the assays because those particular transporters are rendered dysfunctional during vesicle production, probably due to disruption of their quaternary structure (Thanassi et al., 1997). A series of initial experiments (data not shown) were performed to determine the concentration of each bile salt that gave the optimal fluorescence dequench signal; these concentrations were found to be 2.5 mM and 2.0 mM for sodium cholate and sodium deoxycholate respectively. Control experiments with vesicles containing the MdtM D22A mutant (Fig. 4B, D and F; Fig. S5B, D and F) support our argument that the fluorescence dequench measured in vesicles enriched with wild-type MdtM was specific to that transporter activity and not due to action of the bile salts on the vesicular membrane.In assays performed at pH 7.2 (Fig. 4) addition of d-lactate to energize the vesicle membranes caused a rapid quench of the acridine orange fluorescence signal as protons were pumped by respiratory chain proteins into the vesicular lumen to generate a ΔpH (acid inside). Addition of bile salt to inverted vesicles enriched with recombinant wild-type MdtM resulted in a rapid dequenching of the acridine orange steady-state fluorescence (Fig. 4A and C). The observed dequench of the acridine orange fluorescence signal originated from alkalinization of the vesicular lumen as protons were pumped out to drive active uptake of the added bile salt, thus implying that MdtM was responsible for catalysing both cholate/H+ and deoxycholate/H+ exchange reactions. Support for the contention that the observed dequench was due exclusively to MdtM-mediated bile salt/H+ antiport came from assays performed on control vesicles generated from cells that overexpressed the dysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant (Fig. 4B and D). In these assays, addition of 2.0 mM sodium deoxycholate to the vesicles at the time indicated had no effect on the fluorescence signal (Fig. 4D). Addition of 2.5 mM sodium cholate to the same control vesicles, however, resulted in small but reproducible dequench of the fluorescence (Fig. 4B) that probably originates from the activity of chromosomally encoded MdtM, or from other transporters that possess cholate transport activity under the experimental conditions employed and whose role in cholate efflux is not yet described. Assays performed at pH 6.0 (Fig. S5) gave similar results to those performed at pH 7.2, except that the magnitude of the fluorescence dequench upon addition of bile salt was more pronounced in assays performed at the latter pH value.In all the assays performed, addition of the uncoupler CCCP resulted in complete dissipation of the ΔpH across the vesicle membrane, as revealed by an instantaneous and essentially maximal dequenching of the fluorescence signal; this not only validated the assertion that the initial fluorescence dequench observed upon the addition of the bile salts was due to MdtM-catalysed bile salt/H+ exchange activity driven by the electrochemical gradient, but also confirmed that the inverted vesicles remained intact and maintained integrity throughout the life of the assays.MdtM possesses an Na+/H+ antiport activity that is readily apparent at alkaline pH values, and this activity competes with the multidrug efflux role of the transporter (Holdsworth and Law, 2013). MIC measurements performed at pH 8.5 suggested that the same Na+/H+ antiport activity effectively inhibited the bile salt efflux function of MdtM (Table S1). Therefore, to exclude MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ exchange as a source of the acridine orange fluorescence dequench that occurred upon addition of the sodium salts of cholate and deoxycholate to the inverted vesicles, a further set of control assays was performed. In these assays, again performed at pH 7.2 (Fig. 4E and F) and pH 6.0 (Fig. S5E and F), 2.5 mM sodium gluconate was added at the time indicated to lactate-energized inverted vesicles produced from TO114 cells that overexpressed wild-type MdtM, or its dysfunctional D22A mutant, from plasmidic DNA. There was no measureable dequench of the respiration-induced acridine orange fluorescence quench in response to added sodium in both the test and control vesicles at pH 6.0 (Fig. S5E and F). However, at pH 7.2, addition of the monovalent cation to vesicles containing wild-type MdtM caused a small dequench (< 20% of that observed in vesicles that had bile salts added) of the fluorescence (Fig. 4E) due to residual Na+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM at the slightly alkaline pH (Holdsworth and Law, 2013). Therefore, the results of the acridine orange fluorescence quench/dequench assays clearly supported an MdtM-dependent bile salt/H+ antiport driven by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient.MdtM-catalysed bile salt/H+ antiport is electrogenicTo determine whether MdtM catalyses electrogenic transport by utilizing the transmembrane electrical potential (Δψ) as the driving force, inverted vesicles were produced from TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM or pD22A and assayed for electrogenicity in a chloride-free and potassium-free buffer using the Δψ-sensitive fluorophore Oxonol V. Addition of lactate to energize vesicles buffered to pH 7.2 resulted in the generation of a respiratory Δψ, as evidenced by a rapid quench of the Oxonol V fluorescence signal (Fig. 5). The addition of 2.5 mM cholate to the inverted vesicles enriched with wild-type MdtM resulted in a partial depolarization of Δψ, represented as a dequenching of the Oxonol V fluorescence, as the Δψ was consumed by the MdtM-mediated bile salt/H+ transport reaction (Fig. 5A). A similar response was detected upon the addition of 2.0 mM deoxycholate to wild-type MdtM-containing vesicles (Fig. 5C). In each of the assays, addition of the protonophore CCCP at the time indicated resulted in almost complete dissipation of Δψ. Addition of cholate to negative control vesicles enriched with dysfunctional MdtM D22A resulted in a perceptible dequench (Fig. 5B), probably arising from residual electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM (Holdsworth and Law, 2013). In contrast, addition of the sodium salt of deoxycholate to negative control vesicles resulted in no detectable depolarization of the transmembrane potential (Fig. 5D). In this instance, the lack of any dequench signal was probably due to the fact that MdtM possesses low affinity for Na+ cations (Holdsworth and Law, 2013), and the 2.0 mM concentration of Na+ cations in the assay was insufficient to elicit any measureable electrogenic transport. The results of assays performed at pH 6.0 (Fig. S6) were similar to those observed for assays performed at pH 7.2, except that addition of cholate to negative control vesicles enriched with dysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant resulted in no detectable depolarization (Fig. S6B).Although the set of experiments described above showed that MdtM-dependent antiport was Δψ-consuming, from which it was inferred to be electrogenic, to provide assurance that it was bile salt/H+ antiport and not Na+/H+ antiport activity that was being measured, additional control experiments were performed to test the effects of adding sodium gluconate in place of the bile salts, and by adding the ionophores nigericin (to selectively dissipate ΔpH) and valinomycin (to selectively dissipate Δψ) to inverted vesicles that overproduced wild-type MdtM (Fig. S7). As shown in Fig. S7C, no response of the Oxonol V fluorescence signal was observed upon addition of 2.5 mM sodium gluconate to the vesicles at pH 6.0. However, as expected, due to the electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM at alkaline pH (Holdsworth and Law, 2013), a small dissipation of Δψ was recorded in the assay performed at pH 7.2 (Fig. S7A). Addition of valinomycin to abolish the Δψ (Fig. S7A), or the protonophore CCCP to abolish both components of the electrochemical gradient (Fig. S7C) to the vesicles at the times indicated caused a rapid and complete dequench of the Oxonol V fluorescence. In a final set of controls, nigericin was added to inverted, wild-type MdtM-containing vesicles pre-incubated with 50 mM potassium gluconate (Fig. S7B and D). In the assay performed at pH 7.2 addition of the ionophore resulted in a small increase in the magnitude of Δψ (observed on the assay trace in Fig. S7B as a further quench in the Oxonol V fluorescence signal) as ΔpH was converted to Δψ by the electroneutral K+/H+ exchange activity of the ionophore (Padan et al., 1976). However, in the same assay performed at pH 6.0 (Fig. S7D) no such conversion was observed, probably due to activity of other transporters that could maintain the ΔpH in the more acidic environment. As observed in the previous assays, valinomycin or CCCP caused a complete dissipation of Δψ. All the control experiments provided evidence that the vesicles had retained integrity and were therefore able to maintain an electrochemical potential across the membrane during the assay lifetime, and also established that the nature of MdtM-catalysed cholate/H+ and deoxycholate/H+ antiport is electrogenic.", "Experimental procedures": "Experimental proceduresAll growth media, antibiotics and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK) unless stated otherwise.Bacterial strains and plasmidsEscherichia coli BW25113 {rrnB3 ΔlacZ4787 hsdR514 Δ(araBAD)567 Δ(rhaBAD)568 rph-1} (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000) and its ΔmdtM, ΔacrB, ΔemrB and ΔompF single-deletion mutants were obtained from the Keio collection (National BioResource Project, Japan) (Baba et al., 2006) and used for MIC assays. The ΔmdtM and ΔacrB deletion mutants were used as the background strains for determining IC50 values of cells expressing wild-type mdtM (pMdtM) or, as a control, dysfunctional MdtM D22A (pD22A) mutant from pBAD/Myc-His A vector (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a). Ethidium bromide efflux assays used the outer membrane permeability mutant UTL2 strain of E. coli (Beja and Bibi, 1996). For production of inverted vesicles used in transport assays, E. coli TO114 complemented with pMdtM or pD22A was used. The TO114 strain is deficient in the Na+/H+ antiporters NhaA and NhaB, and the K+/H+ antiporter ChaA. This strain was chosen specifically to abrogate any potential interference from NhaA and NhaB Na+/H+ antiport activity (Holdsworth and Law, 2013). Overproduction of wild-type and mutant MdtM for purification and subsequent use in substrate-binding assays was performed in E. coli LMG194 (KS272 Δara714 leu::Tn10) transformed with the appropriate plasmid (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a).Construction of MdtM mutantsMdtM W309F and W309A mutants were produced using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with pMdtM as the template, and the following 5′–3′ PCR primers (W309F forward: tcgccgcacgtcttcctgtggtcggtgc; W309F reverse: gcaccgaccacaggaagacgtgcggcga; W309A forward: gtcgccgcacgtcgcgctgtggtcggtg; W309A reverse: caccgaccacagcgcgacgtgcggcgac). The fidelity of each mutant construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis.Determination of MIC of bile saltsMICs of the sodium salts of cholate and deoxycholate were determined using serial twofold dilutions of each bile salt from a 128 mg ml−1 stock on solid Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates, each inoculated with 104 colony-forming units (cfu) of the strain to be tested. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C prior to ocular inspection for colony growth.Quantitative PCR analysis of mdtM transcript levelsTo test for the effects of bile salt on transcript levels of MdtM, total RNA was extracted from cell pellets prepared from duplicate 1 ml samples of mid-log phase, wild-type E. coli BW25113 with or without 20 mM sodium cholate, and taken at t = 0 min, t = 15 min and t = 30 min. RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase (Turbo DNA Free, Life Technologies) before reverse-transcription to cDNA. Transcriptional changes in mdtM between cholate-treated and untreated samples were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR analysis of these cDNAs, with changes expressed relative to a reference transcript (rrsB, 16S rRNA). PCR primers were designed against GenBank-derived rrsB and mdtM sequences (rrsB forward: agagcaagcggacctcataa; rrsB reverse: aacgtattcaccgtggcatt; mdtM forward: gcctgggatcattaatgtgg; mdtM reverse: agccactgtaacgccatacc). Following collection of Ct and efficiency values using RotorGene software, transcriptional changes in mdtM were determined using the Augmented ΔΔCt method (Pfaffl, 2001).Determination of IC50 of cholate and deoxycholateTo test the contribution of MdtM to intrinsic resistance against bile salts, growth of E. coli cells was measured in LB liquid medium that contained varying concentrations of the sodium salts of cholate or deoxycholate at pH values of 7.2 and 6.0. The pH of the medium was buffered by 70 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino] propane (BTP) and pH was adjusted by HCl. Assays were performed based on a previously described method (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b).Whole-cell ethidium bromide transport assaysThe effect of addition of 3.0 mM sodium cholate and 3.0 mM sodium deoxycholate on ethidium bromide (EtBr) efflux by E. coli outer membrane permeability mutant UTL2 cells enriched with MdtM was determined using a method described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2013) except that assays were performed at pH 6.0 to abrogate interference by MdtM-catalysed Na+(K+)/H+ antiport that occurs at alkaline pH. To test that bile salt had not compromised cell membrane integrity, UTL2 cells used to investigate the inhibitory effects of 3.0 mM sodium cholate on the EtBr efflux activity of MdtM were removed from the cuvette, washed twice in assay buffer to remove CCCP, then re-energized by addition of glucose.Measurement of proton-driven antiportAssays of bile salt/H+ antiport were conducted by measuring the fluorescence quenching/dequenching of the pH-sensitive indicator acridine orange upon addition of either 2.5 mM cholate or 2.0 mM deoxycholate to energized inverted membrane vesicles generated from antiporter-deficient E. coli TO114 cells that overproduced recombinant wild-type MdtM. Inverted vesicles of TO114 cells that overproduced dysfunctional MdtM from pD22A were used as controls. Transport measurements were performed as described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b) at pH values of 7.2 and 6.0. Control experiments to ensure any observed fluorescence dequench was not a result of MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ antiport were performed by addition of 2.5 mM sodium gluconate instead of bile salt. All experiments were performed in triplicate on at least two separate preparations of inverted vesicles.Measurement of the electrogenicity of bile salt/H+ antiportThe Δψ-sensitive fluorophore Oxonol V [bis-(3-phenyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol] (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) was used to determine if the MdtM-mediated antiport observed in the previous experiments was electrogenic. Inverted vesicles were produced from TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM or pD22A as described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2013), except that the vesicle resuspension buffer was made Cl−-free by substitution of the 140 mM choline chloride component with 280 mM sorbitol and by using H2SO4 rather than HCl to adjust buffer pH. Vesicles (0.5 mg ml−1 membrane protein) were added to assay buffer (10 mM BTP, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 μM Oxonol V) that had its pH adjusted to 7.2 or 6.0. Electrogenic antiport activity was estimated on the basis of its ability to dissipate the established Δψ (recorded as a dequenching of the fluorescence signal) in response to addition of 2.5 mM sodium cholate or 2.0 mM sodium deoxycholate to vesicles at the times indicated. As a control experiment, to ensure that there was no interference from MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ antiport, 2.5 mM sodium gluconate was substituted for bile salt. As a further control, 1 μM of the ionophore nigericin (which at low concentrations selectively consumes ΔpH in the presence of K+ via electroneutral K+/H+ exchange) was added to vesicles of TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM. These vesicles were incubated in assay buffer that contained 50 mM K+ gluconate, and valinomycin (5 μM) was added to selectively abolish Δψ.Purification of MdtMWild-type and mutant protein for use in substrate binding assays and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies was homologously overexpressed in E. coli LMG194 cells and purified following the protocol described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2012a). Purified protein was placed on ice and used immediately for substrate binding studies. Concentrated MdtM solution for use in CD studies was diluted down with an imidazole- and NaCl-free buffer to minimize interference from those compounds with the spectroscopic measurements.Substrate binding assaysSubstrate-binding affinity of purified, wild-type MdtM for the sodium salts of cholate and deoxycholate was determined at pH 7.2 and pH 6.0 using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching of protein in detergent solution based on the protocol described previously (Holdsworth and Law, 2012b). Control assays that investigated binding of cholate to the W309F and W309A MdtM mutants were performed at pH 7.2.Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopyFar UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco UK). MdtM samples were analysed at pH 6 and pH 7.2 using a 5.3 μM protein solution in a 0.02 cm pathlength quartz cuvette. A suitable buffer baseline was collected and subtracted from each protein spectrum. Corrected data were expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity (degrees cm−2 dmol−1). The online CD secondary structure analysis server Dichroweb (Whitmore and Wallace, 2004) and the CONTIN procedure Reference set 4 (Provencher and Glockner, 1981) was used to analyse the CD data.Western blot analysis of recombinant MdtMEstimation of expression levels of recombinant wild-type and D22A mutant MdtM in transformed BW25113 ΔmdtM and BW25113 ΔacrB cells grown at pH 7.2 and pH 6.0 was performed by Western blot analysis following a protocol described before (Holdsworth and Law, 2013)."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 24672, "tokens": 3834, "source": "regular"}, "Experimental procedures": {"chars": 9032, "tokens": 1315, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Molecular Microbiology", "year": "2014", "doi": "10.1111/mmi.12597", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

C. jejuni strains were cultured at 37°C or 42°C on Blood Agar Base No. 2 (BA) medium containing 5% horse blood or in Heart Infusion broth (HI; Oxoid), under microaerobic conditions (5% O2, 7.5% CO2, 7.5% H2, 80% N2), or under oxygen limited conditions (0.3% O2, 10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2). Kanamycin (25 μg ml-1) and/or chloramphenicol (15 μg ml-1) were added when appropriate. E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1), kanamycin (30 μg ml-1), or chloramphenicol (30 μg ml-1).Construction of C. jejuni ggt, racS, and racRS MutantsTo inactivate the ggt gene, the ggt gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides Cjj67Sac and Cjj67Xba (Table 2). The obtained PCR product was digested with ClaI and PstI resulting in a 1.2-kb DNA fragment, which was ligated into pBluescript II KS to give plasmid pUWM799. Plasmid pUWM799 was digested with BglII to remove a 0.1-kb internal ggt fragment and was ligated to a 0.8-kb BamHI fragment containing the cat cassette (0.8 kb) of pRY109. The resulting ggt knockout construct pUWM804 contained the cat cassette in the same orientation as the ggt gene.To construct the racS and racRS knockout constructs plasmid pGEM1261 (van der Stel et al., 2015), containing the genes Cj1261–Cj1263 was amplified by PCR using the primers RacSendBamHI/RacSstart2BamHI or Cj1261FBamHI/RacSendBamHI, respectively. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated to a 0.8-kb BamHI cat cassette from pAV35 (Vliet et al., 1998), resulting in plasmids pGEM1262::Cm and pGEM1261-1262::Cm, respectively.The genes ggt, racS, and the racRS were disrupted in C. jejuni strain 81116 or 81-176 by natural transformation using the knock-out plasmids pUWM804, pJET1262::Cm and pGEM1261-1262::Cm, respectively. Double cross-over recombination events were confirmed by PCR.Construction of racRS Complementation StrainTo complement the racRS mutant, the complementation plasmid pMA1–1261–1263 (van der Stel et al., 2015) was first transformed into E. coli S17 and then conjugated (Labigne-Roussel et al., 1987) to the racRS::Cm mutant strain.Purification of Recombinant RacR and Cytoplasmic RacSRacR (N-His) and RacScyto (N-His) were expressed and purified as described before (Wösten et al., 2004) using plasmids pT7.7-RacR(N-his) and pT7.7-RacScyto(N-his). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Construction of ggt Promoter Luciferase ConstructsTo localize where RacR binds on the ggt promoter, different lengths of the upstream region of the ggt gene were amplified by PCR. The PCRs were generated by fusion polymerase (Thermo) with Cj81116 genomic DNA as template and one of the primer pairs GGT28/GGT204, GGT28/GGT104, GGT28/GGT69, or GGT28/GGT35. The PCR products were digested with SacI and SphI (Thermo) and cloned into SacI, SphI digested plasmid pMA5-metK-luc (Bouwman et al., 2013) to replace the metK promoter. To obtain a promotorless luciferase vector, pMA5-metK-luc was digested with SacI and SphI, blunted with the blunting enzyme from the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo) and finally self-ligated. The plasmids were verified by sequencing (Macrogen). The obtained plasmids were transformed to E. coli S17 and subsequently conjugated to C. jejuni 81116 and the racRS mutant.Real-Time RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from late logarithmic phase C. jejuni cultures grown in HI medium at 42°C under oxygen limiting conditions with the addition of 50 mM nitrate, using RNA-BeeTM kit (Tel-Test, Inc) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (van der Stel et al., 2015). Primers used in this assay are listed in Table 2. Experiments were repeated with three independently grown cultures. Fold increase was calculated with the 2ΔΔCt method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008) using rpoD as reference gene.GGT Activity AssayTo assay the GGT activity the production of 3-carboxy-4-nitroaniline was followed by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm according to a modified procedure described by (Chevalier et al., 1999). Briefly, 1 mL of bacterial culture was pelleted and stored at −80°C for at least 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μL buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 1 μg/mL lysozyme), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Next, the bacteria were disrupted by sonication followed by centrifugation (10 min at 12000 × g at 4°C). From the cell free bacterial lysate 20 μl was mixed together with 180 μl of a reagent containing 2.9 mM L-γ-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide, 100 mM glycylglycine and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). Samples were measured every 60 s during an incubation period of 30 min at 37°C. From these graphs the slope of all values in a linear range was calculated. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). GGT activity is expressed as nmol min-1 mg protein-1. The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Luciferase AssayExpression of the luciferase in C. jejuni 81116 and racRS mutant strain harboring the pMA5-ggtprom-luc plasmids was measured as previously described (Bouwman et al., 2013). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted to an OD550 nm of 0.05 and grown for 7.5 h in HI with 50 mM KNO3 in an oxygen limiting atmosphere at 37°C. One milliliter of each culture was pelleted (8000 ×g, 5 min, 4°C) and suspended in 100 μL RLB buffer (Promega) supplemented with 0.5% Triton-X100. Suspensions were stored at −80°C for at least 30 min to disrupt the bacteria. Bacterial lysate (20 μL) was mixed with 50 μL of luciferase reagent (Promega) and RLU’s were measured immediately on a luminometer (TD20/20, Turner Designs). The data shown represents at least three independent experiments.Gel Mobility Shift AssayThe promoter regions upstream of ggt, phoX (Cj0145), and Cj0200c were amplified by PCR using Dreamtaq polymerase (Thermo) and one of the primers sets GGTpromDIG/GGT204, GGTpromDIG/GGT104, GGTpromDIG/GGT69, GGTpromDIG/GGT35, Cj145F/CJ0145RDIG, and Cj200F/Cj200RDIG, respectively, (Table 2) and Cj81116 chromosomal DNA as template. Primers GGTpromDIG, Cj0145RDIG, and Cj200RDIG were ordered with a digoxigenin (DIG) label (Eurofins genomics). Approximately, 50 fmol DIG-labeled PCR fragments was incubated with His-tagged RacR, RacScyto, and 2 mM ATP for 30 min on ice. RacR, RacScyto, and ATP were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C to allow phosphorylation. The binding buffer used for protein-DNA incubations was 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml poly-(dI-dC) and 10% glycerol. Samples (10 μl) were run on a 4% non-denaturing Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel at 4°C. After electrophoresis the DNA was blotted on a hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham) and PCR fragments were visualized using α-DIG-AP, Fab fragments, and CSPD substrate (Roche).Growth CurvesCampylobacter jejuni precultures were grown for 7 h in HI medium with the addition of 50 mM nitrate at oxygen limiting conditions at 42°C. The precultures were diluted 50 times in 300 μL DMEM (without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate, bicarbonate, and phenol red, D5030, Sigma) with the addition of 10 mM TMAO and 10 mM glutamate, glutamine or aspartate, and growth curves were generated at 42°C in a 100 well honeycomb plate which was continuously shaking in a Bioscreen C MRB (Oy Growth Curves Ab) computer-controlled incubator. The incubator was placed inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Labs, Grass Lake, MI, USA), due to suboptimal gas exchange in the honeycomb plate the oxygen concentration was set to 1%, which yielded comparable growth as when bacteria were grown in rectangular flasks inside an anaerobic jar containing 0.3% O2. The OD600nm of cultures was recorded every 15 min during 45 h. For clarity reasons only point at 2.5 h, or 5 h intervals are shown. Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate.Statistical AnalysisPrism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Results are shown as mean ± SEM. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed with Bonferroni post hoc tests; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "Results": "ResultsRacR Regulates ggt Transcription and ActivityAs the C. jejuni RacRS two-component system regulates the cytoplasmic glutamate production by activating the gltBD genes (van der Stel et al., 2015), we wondered whether GGT, responsible for the periplasmic glutamate production, is also regulated by the RacRS system. To investigate this we measured the ggt transcripts in the C. jejuni 81116 wildtype strains, the isogenic racR mutant, and in the complemented racR mutant, grown until late log phase under RacRS inducing conditions, i.e., 0.3% O2 with 50 mM nitrate. To verify that we used RNA that was isolated under RacR inducing conditions, we also measured the transcripts of aspA and gltB genes. Using real time RT-PCR we observed that inactivation of racR resulted in a 55-fold increase of aspA mRNA, and a sixfold decrease of the gltB consistent with our previous results (van der Stel et al., 2015) and confirming that RacR is induced under these conditions. A significant fivefold decrease was observed for the ggt mRNA transcripts. The differences between the wt and the racR mutant were almost restored to wt levels by introducing complementation plasmid harboring the RacRS operon (Figure 1). These results suggest that RacR has a strong influence on the production of glutamate as it not only activates the transcription of the genes required for the cytoplasmic glutamate production (gltB), but also the periplasmic production of glutamate (ggt).To verify that the two-component system RacR/RacS also influences the GGT enzyme activity, we measured the GGT activity in C. jejuni stationary phase cultures grown at 0.3% O2 with or without the addition of nitrate (Figure 2). Only background levels of GGT activity were observed in the ggt mutant indicating that this enzyme is solely responsible for the production of 3-carboxy-4-nitroaniline in the GGT assay. Maximum GGT activity of bacteria grown in HI liquid medium was observed in stationary phase (data not shown). A low GGT activity was measured in wt and racR mutant when the strains were grown at 0.3% O2; however, the GGT activity increased threefold in the wt bacteria when nitrate was present. This induction was not observed in the racRS double mutant or the single racR, or racS mutant strains. When the racRS, racR, or racS mutants were complemented with a plasmid harboring the RacRS operon the GGT activity was restored to wildtype levels. These results indicate that GGT activity largely depends on a functional and activated RacR and RacS, as exists under limited oxygen condition in the presence of an alternative electron acceptor.RacR Protein Binds to the Promoter Region of the ggt GeneTo investigate whether RacR activates the ggt gene directly by binding to the ggt promoter region, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed. Hereto the RacR response regulator and the cytoplasmic region of RacS were isolated as His-tagged recombinant proteins and together with ATP incubated with DIG-labeled DNA fragments containing the promoter region of the ggt gene or, as a negative control, the promoter regions of the phoX and Cj0200c genes. Incubation of RacR and the cytosolic region of RacS in the presence of ATP led to rapid phosphorylation of RacR (van der Stel et al., 2015). Unphosphorylated RacR bound to the ggt promoter but less RacR was needed when it was phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic part of RacS (Figure 3A). Phosphorylated RacR did not bind to the phoX and Cj0200c promoter fragments as no band shifts were observed, while a clear band shift was seen for the ggt promoter fragment (Figure 3B). These results indicate that RacR specifically binds to the ggt promoter and that phosphorylation of RacR enhances the binding affinity.RacR Binds to a RacR Binding Consensus Sequence in Front of the ggt PromoterTo investigate where RacR binds on the ggt promoter, an in silico analysis of the promoter region was performed (Figure 4A). Based on this analysis, primers were designed to amplify DNA fragments in order to study the different elements on the ggt promoter region. Besides the full intergenic region between the ggt and c8j_0034 gene (-204 nt fragment) three truncated ggt promoter elements were generated; (1) a −104 nt fragment containing a putative RacR binding consensus sequence, a palindromic sequence and the putative −35, −16 and −10 region; (2) a −69 nt fragment lacking the putative RacR binding consensus sequence, and (3) a -35 nt fragment only containing the putative −35, −16 and −10 regions. These promoter elements were cloned in front of the luciferase reporter gene, replacing the metK promoter located on plasmid pMA5-metK-luc (Bouwman et al., 2013). Luciferase activity was measured in the wt and racRS mutant strain under RacR inducing conditions. Because of poor stability of the luciferase enzyme at 42°C (data not shown), all luciferase reporter assay experiments were performed at 37°C. In wt bacteria high luciferase activity was measured only from the promoter elements −204 and −104, both containing the predicted RacR nucleotide binding site (Figure 4B). All promoter fragments resulted in a low luciferase activity in the racRS mutant, which was, however, still higher than the luciferase activity of the strain carrying a promoterless luciferase plasmid. These results indicate that the region upstream of the ggt gene containing the predicted RacR consensus sequence is important for enhancing of the ggt transcription in a RacRS dependent manner.In order to verify the luciferase reporter results, the different ggt promoter elements were subjected to EMSA experiments (Figure 4C). The -204 and -104 ggt promoter elements, harboring the predicted RacR binding site showed a distinct bandshift when phosphorylated RacR was present. In accordance with the luciferase assay results RacR did not bind to the two shorter fragments. These results prove that phosphorylated RacR binds to the upstream region of the ggt promoter region containing the predicted RacR binding consensus nucleotide site.RacR is Important for C. jejuni to Generate More Biomass out of Glutamine, under RacRS Inducing ConditionsTo investigate whether the GGT activity contributes to an increased bacterial fitness, growth curves in DMEM medium with or without 10 mM glutamate or 10 mM glutamine were recorded for the wt, the racR and ggt mutant strains under RacR inducing conditions. To facilitate growth TMAO was used as electron acceptor, because nitrate proved to be detrimental for growth at these nutrient poor conditions. The growth rates of the wt grown with either glutamate or glutamine as sole carbon source were very similar, although the maximum OD600 nm was higher when glutamine was present (Figure 5A). The racR mutant strain on the other hand showed a reduced growth rate when grown on glutamine compared to glutamate and consistently reached a slightly lower OD600 nm (Figure 5B). Furthermore compared to the wt, the racR mutant shows a reduced growth rate and a lower maximum growth yield. The ggt mutant strain grew comparable to the wt on glutamate, but hardly grew on glutamine (Figure 5C), verifying that GGT is needed to utilize glutamine as sole carbon/energy source (Hofreuter et al., 2006). These results prove that under low oxygen conditions in the presence of alternative electron acceptors the RacRS system is important for the conversion of glutamine to glutamate.Campylobacter jejuni is Capable of Utilizing Glutamine in a GGT Independent MannerAlthough GGT is required for growth with glutamine as sole carbon source, we observed that the ggt mutant reached a higher OD600nm when grown on DMEM plus glutamine compared to DMEM alone (Figure 5C). C. jejuni possess a glutamine transporter PaqPQ that has been shown to be functional under nutrient rich conditions (Lin et al., 2009). To investigate whether the ggt mutant is able to grow on glutamine under nutrient rich conditions, aspartate was added to the DMEM medium. Both the growth rate and bacterial yield of the ggt mutant increased with glutamate and glutamine compared to aspartate alone (Figure 5D). Similar results were obtained when serine was used instead of aspartate (data not shown). This GGT independent glutamine utilization phenotype was also seen for the C. jejuni 81-176 ggt mutant strain and the C. jejuni 11168 strain, which naturally lacks the ggt gene (data not shown). These results indicate that GGT is important when other energy sources than glutamines are not available."}, "stats": {"Materials and Methods": {"chars": 8329, "tokens": 1273, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 8512, "tokens": 1347, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2015", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2015.00567", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Jensen from the Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. The use of anonymous NHDFs for basic research is conducted under the guidelines from the Danish Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics. All studies were conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html). NHDF were cultured in D10 medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. All ethical approval and consent was received for the acquisition of these cells. Human iPSCs were cultured in knockout serum replacement (KSR) media, consisting of knockout DMEM (10829–018, Gibco), 20 % Knock Out Serum Replacement (10828–028, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (11140–050, Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (313-50-010, Gibco) and 10 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (PHG0026, Invitrogen). The mRNA-iPSCs and mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 were generated by mRNA transfection and characterized previously [16]. The human lenti-iPSCs were generated with lentivirus transduction using a single polycistronic lentiviral vector expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC according to the methods reported by Papapetrou et al. [17]. Human BM-MSCs were purchased from Lonza (PT-2501) and cultured in MSC medium consisting of DMEM-low glucose (31885–023, Gibco), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS; 26140–079, Gibco), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. The K562 cells were kindly provided by Marianne Hokland from the Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University. All cells were cultured in a tissue culture incubator with 5 % CO2 at 37 °C.Lentivirus packagingHEK293 cells were cultured in D10 medium. At the day of transfection, 1 × 107 HEK293 cells in each P15 dish (nine dishes in total) were transfected by the CaPO4 co-precipitation method with pRSV-REV, pMD.2G, pMDGP-Lg/pRRE plasmids and a lentiviral vector (pLM-fSV2A, Addgene ID 27512 [18]) expressing the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, KLF4, c-Myc and SOX2) polycistronically. One day after transfection, cells were fed with fresh medium (17 ml/dish). Cell medium containing lentivirus was harvested at 48 h and 72 h post-transfection. Lentivirus was concentrated by ultra-centrifugation (25,000 rpm, 4 °C, L7 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman). Virus pellets were dissolved with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −80 °C. Virus titer was measured with the P24 Elisa kit (XB-1000, XpressBio).Lentivirus-mediated reprogrammingNHDFs (1.5 × 105 cells/per well) were seeded in a six-well plate 1 day before transduction. Cells were transduced with reprogramming lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL) in D10 medium. Cell media were changed every other day. Six days post-transduction, transduced NHDFs (2 × 104 cells/per well) were harvested by trypsinization and seeded on irradiation-inactivated mouse feeder cells in six-well plates, and cultured in KSR medium. KSR medium was changed daily. Approximately 21 days post-transduction, the iPSC colonies were ready for picking and expansion.Immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min, followed by PBS wash (three times, 5 min each) and permeabilization with 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with blocking solution (5 % donkey serum in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Goat antihuman OCT3/4 (Abcam, ab27985, 100× diluted) and rabbit antihuman Nanog (Abcam, ab80892, 100× diluted) were used. Cells were then stained with a secondary antibody for 2 h. Alexa 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) and Alexa Fluor® 488 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Life Technologies) were used for second antibody staining. For live cell staining of TRA-1-60 and CD44, cells were stained using the live cell imaging kit from Life Technologies (Tra-1-60 AF594, CD44 AF488) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All images were taken with a Leica fluorescence microscope.Derivation of MSCs from iPSCs generated by lentiviral reprogrammingThe iPSC-MSC derivation was performed according to our previous protocol. One characterized pluripotent lenti-iPSC line was used for MSC differentiation. Briefly, 3 days after passaging the lenti-iPSCs to feeder cell culture, the KSR medium was replaced with MSC medium. The lenti-iPSCs were maintained in MSC medium for 2 weeks, with medium changed every other day. Subsequently, cells were passaged to gelatin-coated (0.1 % gelatin, room temperature for 2 h) tissue culture vessels by trypsinization (0.25 % trypsin/1 mM EDTA). Cells were defined as passage 1 (P1) after the first passaging. For maintenance of iPSC-MSCs, cells were passaged when 90 % confluent and seeded with a density of 1.6 × 104 cells/cm2 to new tissue culture vessels.MSC surface marker characterization by flow cytometryDetail information on antibodies against the human antigens CD11b, CD14, CD29, CD31, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105 and HLA-DR are shown in Table 1. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with 2 % FBS-PBS twice; 2 × 105 cells were re-suspended in 100 μl 2 % FBS-PBS and incubated with the conjugated antibody for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Stained cells were then washed with 2 % FBS-PBS twice and re-suspended in 500 μl 1 % formaldehyde-PBS for flow cytometry analysis (LSRFortessa); 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and data were analyzed with Flowjo.Number of population doublingsBM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 and lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 were serially subcultured in six-well plates for 2 weeks. Briefly, cells were cultured in six-well plates; when cells were 90 % confluent, they were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. The cells were then cultured in a new six-well plate with the same starting cell density. The number of population doublings (NPD) was calculated according to the following equation: NPD = log10 (Nh/Ni) × 3.33, where Nh and Ni are the numbers of harvested and initiating cells, respectively [19]. NPDs were performed in six replicates for each type of MSC.Cell proliferation rate assayCell proliferation rate measurements were conducted using the Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor® 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Cat. no. C10425, Life Technologies). K562, BM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001, and lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 cells were seeded in six-well plates (1.0 × 105 cells/well) 24 h prior to changing to fresh growth medium (negative control) or growth medium containing 10 μM EdU. Cells cultured in growth medium without EdU were used as negative controls. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO2 for 2 h, then harvested by trypsinization and subjected to EdU staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were washed with 500 μL 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS, incubated with 100 μL Click-iT fixative for 15 min in the dark, washed with 500 μL 1 % BSA-PBS, re-suspended with 100 μL 1× component E, stained in labeling cocktail for 30 min, washed with 500 μL 1× component E, and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRFortessa); 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and data were analyzed with Flowjo.Tri-lineage differentiationBM-MSCs, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001, and lenti-iPS-MSC-A001 cells (all P9) were used for the tri-lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and adipogenesis).For osteogenic differentiation, cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 3 days, the media were changed to either MSC growth medium (as control) or osteogenic differentiation medium, which contains DMEM-high glucose (Invitrogen), 10 % FBS (Gibco), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nM dexamethasone (D2915, Sigma), 10 mM β-Glycerophosphate (G9891, Sigma), 50 μM ascorbic acid-2 phosphate (A8960, Sigma), and 10 μM Vit-D (D1530, Sigma). Cells were maintained in growth medium or osteogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks with medium changed every 3 days. At the end of differentiation, samples were subjected to Alizarin Red S (Sigma) staining, calcium quantification analysis following the manufacturer’s instructions, and quantitative PCR analysis.For chondrogenic differentiation, 2.5 × 105 cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to form a small pellet in a “V” shape 96-well plate. The cell pellets were cultured in either MSC growth medium (as control) or chondrogenic differentiation medium consisting of DMEM (F12, Gibco) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid, 100 nM dexamethasone, 1:100 ITS premix (BD Biosciences), 40 μg/ml L-proline (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL human recombinant TGF-β3 (R&D systems), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin [16, 20]. The medium was changed every 3 days. After 3 weeks, cell pellets were collected for toluidine blue staining to validate the extracellular chondrocyte matrix [21]. Purple stain of proteoglycans was observed by phase-contrast microscopy.Adipogenic differentiation was carried out by culturing the cells at a density of 1.2 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM-high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15 % horse serum (Sigma), and 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (MSC growth medium as control). After 3 weeks, cells were stained with Oil-red O (Sigma-Aldrich) solution to evaluate differentiation using standard techniques as previously described [22].PCR and quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by quantification with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and qualification by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with approximately 50 ng of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (170–8891, Bio-Rad). PCR primers for stemness genes and osteogenic genes are listed in Table 2.For PCR characterization of the expression of stemness genes (OCT4, KLF4, C-MYC, SOX2, GDF3, CRIPTO, UTF1, DPPA4, DNMT3B, LIN28A and SALL4), PCR was performed with pfx DNA Polymerase (11708–039, Invitrogen) using 2 μl (five times diluted) cDNA as DNA temperate. The following PCR program was optimized for each stemness gene: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 60 °C or 58 °C or 53 °C (see Table 2) for 30 seconds, and 68 °C for 30 seconds; 1 cycle at 68 °C for 7 min. The GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control.For quantitative PCR of osteogenic genes (of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), and osteocalcin (OC)), 2 uL (five times diluted) cDNA was used. Quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycle 480 SYBR Green I Master kit on LightCycler 480 (Roche) with the following PCR program: 1 hold at 95 °C for 5 min; 50 cycles at 95 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds, and 72 °C for 15 seconds. To mask the signal from primer dimers, fluorescent signal was measured at 77 °C for RUNX2, 80 °C for ALP, 82 °C for GAPDH and COL1A1, and 84 °C for OC. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method after normalization to the reference gene GAPDH.StatisticsAll values are reported as mean ± SD. Data were checked for normal distribution using QQ-plots. The osteogenic gene expression between growth and osteogenic media were compared by t-test in each cell line. Quantitative calcium deposition was investigated using two-way analysis of variance (media type × cell line). If interactions were observed, the variables were investigated separately by the Scheffe method. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "Results": "ResultsMSCs from iPSCs induced by lentiviral-mediated reprogramming have the same fibroblast-like morphology as BM-MSCsThe procedure for iPSC-MSC derivation, which we had established previously, was based on an iPSC line established by mRNA reprogramming from human fibroblasts [16]. It is unknown whether this procedure could be applied to derive functional MSCs from iPSC lines generated by other methods. Lentiviral-mediated reprogramming is favored for its high reprogramming efficiency relative to other methods [17]. We firstly generated one iPSC line using lentiviral-mediated reprogramming. The iPSC line exhibited typical stem cell morphology; expressed pluripotent cell cells markers: TRA1-60 (podocalyxin), OCT4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4, also known as POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1), and NANOG (Nanog homeobox) (Fig. 1a); lacked expression of CD44 (the absence of which is crucial for iPSC pluripotency (Fig. 1a)) [23]; and retained normal polyploidy (diploid as fibroblasts, Fig. 1b). We differentiated the iPSC colony into MSCs using our preciously established procedure [16]. The MSCs derived from lentivial reprogramming iPSCs (lenti-iPSC-MSCs-A001) had the same morphology (fibroblast-like) as the BM-MSCs and the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 line reported previously [16] (Fig. 1c), and are karyotypically normal (Fig. 1d).The iPSC-MSCs obtained similar mesenchymal surface marker profiles to BM-MSCs through in vitro cultivationTo verify whether the iPSC-MSCs harbor mesenchymal characteristics, we analyzed the expression of five MSC-positive surface markers—CD29 (Integrin beta-1), CD44 (Phagocytic glycoprotein 1), CD73 (ecto-5′-nucleotidase), CD90 (Thy-1), and CD105 (endoglin)—and six MSC-negative surface markers—CD11b (integrin alpha-M), CD14 (monocyte differentiation antigen), CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule), CD34 (hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen), CD45 (T-cell surface glycoprotein), and HAL-DR (major histocompatibility complex class II antigen)—in lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 (P10), mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 (P14) and the BM-MSCs (P13) by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2, the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001, lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 and BM-MSCs lacked expression of CD11b, CD14, CD31, CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. Almost 100 % of the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 and mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 cells were positive for CD29, CD44, and CD73, similar to that for BM-MSCs. Robust expression of CD90 and CD105 (almost 100 % positivity) was found in BM-MSCs. The abundance of CD90- and CD105-positive cells in the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 cells was increased following in vitro cultivation. At P3, about 70 % and 80 % of the cells were positive for CD90 and CD105, respectively (data not shown). At P13, the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 cells were approximately 98.15 % CD90 positive and 85.64 % CD105 positive (Fig. 2). Among the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 cells, robust CD90 and CD105 expression (89.18 % and 87.47 % positivity at P14, respectively) were observed, which is consistent with our previous observation [16]. Thus, it appears that lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 (late passage) and mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 cells display similar mesenchymal surface marker profiles as BM-MSCs. However, the MSC surface marker characterization also indicates the heterogeneity of iPSC-MSCs derived by our method, with approximately 10 % cells negative for CD105 (Fig. 2). Based on the finding of passage-dependent mesenchymal enrichment in the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001, cells with over 6 passages were used for the following functional characterizations.The iPSC-MSCs possess fast proliferative capabilityThe iPSC-MSCs have become a promising substitute for BM-MSCs or MSCs derived from other adult tissues. The advantage of using iPSC-MSCs is attributed to their higher self-renewal capability. We compared the proliferation rate of the two iPSC-MSC lines to BM-MSCs using the Click IT-based proliferation assay and flow cytometry. K562 cancer cells were used a positive control for the assay (55.7 % proliferation rate, Fig. 3a). Higher proliferation rate was observed in the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 (42.2 %, Fig. 3b) and lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 (39.5 %, Fig. 3c) than the BM-MSCs (27 %, Fig. 3d). The fast proliferation capacity of iPSC-MSCs was further validated by population doubling array (Fig. 3e).iPSC-MSCs possess adequate osteogenic and chondrogenic, but less adipogenic capabilities, compared with BM-MSCsAccording to the International Society for Cellular Therapy, the capability of tri-lineage differentiation in vitro is one of the major criteria for defining MSCs [24]. We have previously shown that the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 line is capable of tri-lineage differentiation, with a focus on osteogenesis on synthetic biocompatible scaffolds [16]. However, the efficacy of tri-lineage differentiation as compared to BM-MSCs is yet to be addressed. Thus, we compared the osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation capabilities of the two iPSC-MSC lines relative to the BM-MSC line.After 3 weeks of osteogenic induction, calcium mineralization was observed in all three MSC lines by Alizarin Red S staining (Fig. 4a). Mineralization was not observed in the MSCs cultured in normal growth medium. A more homogeneous and robust calcium staining was seen in the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 than in the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001. This observation was further confirmed by quantification of calcium content (Fig. 4b). The lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 line has an efficacy of osteogenesis similar to BM-MSCs. However, approximately twofold less osteogenic capacity was found in the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 cultures, which is likely due to less positivity of CD90 (Fig. 2) [25]. Increased expression of four osteogenic genes (runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), and osteocalcin (OC)) was detected in all MSCs after 3 weeks of osteogenic differentiation (Fig. 4c). The induced expression of RUNX2, ALP and OC was more robust in BM-MSCs relative to the iPSC-MSCs, whereas Col1a1 was more strongly expressed in the iPSC-MSC cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that iPSC-MSCs derived with our method can achieve an adequate osteogenic efficacy similar to that of BM-MSCs.For chondrogenic differentiation, the lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001, mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 and BM-MSC lines were grown in a “V” shape 96-well plate according to a protocol described previously [26]. Toluidine blue staining of pellet sections was used to assess chondrogenic differentiation. Cartilaginous extracellular matrix is stained purple while undifferentiated or fibrous tissue is stained blue. After 3 weeks of chondrogenic differentiation, cartilaginous extracellular matrix was detected in all MSC lines cultured in chondrogenic medium (Fig. 5d–f), but not in growth medium (Fig. 5a–c). The lenti-iPSC-MSC-A001 and mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 had formed similar cartilaginous structures compared with the BM-MSCs.The adipogenic potential of the iPSC-MSCs was also characterized by in vitro adipogenic differentiation. Lipid droplets formed by adipogenesis were assessed by Oil Red O staining. After 3 weeks of adipogenic differentiation, lipid droplets were formed in both iPSC-MSC lines and the BM-MSCs in the adipogenic differentiation medium (Fig. 5j–l) but not in the growth medium (Fig. 5g–i). However, the adipogenic efficacy of both iPSC-MSC lines was much lower than the BM-MSCs. Lipid droplets from iPSC-MSCs were much smaller than those from BM-MSCs.The iPSC-MSCs and tri-lineage differentiated cells lack expression of stemness genesLoss of “stemness” in iPSC-MSCs and iPSC-MSC-derived lineages is one crucial safety criterion when applying iPSC-MSCs to tissue engineering and cell therapy. Lack of tumorigenic potential of the mRNA-iPSC-MSC-YL001 line was validated previously [16]. We further characterized the loss of “stemness” in the iPSC-MSC lines by analyzing the expression of 11 stemness genes (OCT4, KLF4, C-MYC, SOX2, GDF3, CRIPTO, UTF1, DPPA4, DNMT3B, LIN28A and SALL4) in the original iPSCs, iPSC-MSCs, and tri-lineage differentiated cells (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis). All stemness genes were expressed in the iPSCs, whereas most stemness genes, except Klf4 and C-Myc, were not expressed in the iPSC-MSCs and the tri-lineage differentiated cells (Fig. 6). We also found that Klf4 and c-Myc were expressed in the NHDF, which is similar to what has been reported previously [8, 27]."}, "stats": {"Methods": {"chars": 11768, "tokens": 1778, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 8421, "tokens": 1173, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Stem Cell Research & Therapy", "year": "2015", "doi": "10.1186/s13287-015-0137-7", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Transgenic lines that label specific cell or tissue types with fluorescent proteins in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy were an important development to visualize gametophyte development, the fertilization process, and to follow cell differentiation in the early embryo. Staining the cell perimeter to identify surrounding tissue is often a necessary prerequisite to put the fluorescent signal in the right context. Here, we present SCRI Renaissance 2200 (SR2200) as a versatile dye to study various aspects of plant reproduction ranging from pollen tube growth, guidance and reception to the early patterning process in the developing embryo of Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SR2200 can be combined with a wide variety of fluorescent proteins. If spectral information can be recorded, even double labeling with dyes that have very similar emission spectra such as 4′,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI) is possible. The presented staining method can be a single, easy-to-use alternative for a range of other staining protocols commonly used for microscopic analyses in plant reproductive biology.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsPlant material and growth conditionsAll Arabidopsis thaliana plants used in this study were grown under long-day conditions (16 h at 3-kilolux illumination, 8-h dark period) in walk-in chambers at 23 °C and 65 % relative humidity on commercial potting mix (Topferde CL T, Einheitserde) containing systemic insecticide added with the first watering (Confidor WG70, 200 mg/l; Bayer CropScience) as described before (Babu et al. 2013). T-DNA alleles of fer-5 (SAIL_320_C11) and pod1-2 (SALK_049247) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Alonso et al. 2003). fer-5 plants were genotyped by PCR (40 cycles of 30 s at 95°—20 s at 60 °C—1 min 72° with an initial 5 min at 95 °C and a final step of 5 min at 72 °C) using primers fer-5_LP: 5′-GTATGTGACTCGTCTCATGCG-3′ and fer-5_RP: 5′-AAGAGAGAGACGGAATCGTCC-3′ to detect the wild-type allele (1.2-kb product) and SAIL-LB2: 5′-GCTTCCTATTATATCTTCCCAAATTACCAATACA-3′ and fer-5_RP to detect the mutant allele (0.7 kb), respectively. Q0990≫erGFP enhancer trap (C24 ecotype) is derived from the Jim Haselhof collection (http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/Haseloff/Home.html) and has been described before (Levesque et al. 2006; Weijers et al. 2006). Similarly, pDR5rev::mRFPer (Gallavotti et al. 2008) and pNTA≫NLS-tdtomato (Kong et al. 2015) constructs and transgenic lines have been described before.The three-color pollen marker was obtained by crossing individual transgenic lines carrying pMGH3::MGH3-2xVenus-N7, pHTR12::HTR12-mCherry and pLAT52::ER-2xCFP in qrt1-4-/- background.Plasmid constructionTo generate pMGH3::MGH3-YFP, the MGH3 genomic coding sequence without stop codon including 1.24-kb promoter sequence was PCR amplified using primers 5′-TTTTTGTCGACGAATTCATCGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTGGATCCAGCACGTTCCCCACGAATGC-3′. The PCR product was then cloned in-frame as SalI/BamHI fragment in pGreen II nos::bar containing 2xVenus-YFP-N7 followed by the ocs terminator. The pHTR12::HTR12-mCherry construct was obtained by PCR amplification of the HTR12 genomic coding sequence including 0.95-kb upstream sequence using the primers 5′-TTTTTCTCGAGACTTGCTACTTTGTTGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-TTTTTGGATCCCCATGGTCTGCCTTTTCCTCCAA-3′. The PCR product was cut with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into pGreen II nos::kan containing a mCherry coding sequence followed by the ocs terminator. pLAT52::ER-2xCFP was constructed by PCR amplification of the LAT52 promoter sequence using primers 5′-TTTTTGGCGCGCCTCGACATACTCGACTCAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TTTTTATTTAAATCCTAGGCATAAACACACAAATTGT-3′. The PCR product was then transferred into pBluescript containing 2xCFP-HDEL followed by the nos terminator. The pLAT52::ER-2xCFP cassette was then transferred to pGreen II nos::bar.Staining protocolSR staining solution, containing 0.1 % (v/v) SR2200 (Renaissance Chemicals; stock solution of the supplier was considered as 100 %), 1 % (v/v) DMSO (Carl-Roth, Cat.#7029.2), 0.05 % (w/v) Triton-X100, 5 % (w/v) glycerol (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#G5516) and 4 % (w/v) para-formaldehyde (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#6148) in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) was prepared freshly prior to use.For imaging of developing embryos, immature seeds were collected in staining solution on a microscope slide and embryos were gently squeezed out of the ovule by applying pressure on a cover slip. Images of embryos were taken within 30 min after release from the ovules. For images of whole ovules and PTs, ovules were manually dissected out of the silique and collected in a drop of staining solution on a microscope slide. For better tissue penetration, soft vacuum was applied for 5 min at RT. Afterward, the staining solution was replaced by water and again incubated under soft vacuum for 5 min. After replacing the water with 10 % glycerol, the sample was mounted under a coverslip. After squeezing out of the ovule, torpedo stage embryos were processed in a similar fashion as whole ovules.MicroscopyImages were obtained with Olympus FV1000, Leica SP8 and Zeiss LSM780NLO confocal microscopes. SR2200 was excited with a 405-nm laser line and emission recorded between 415 and 476 nm (405/415–476); similar settings were used to detect DAPI. For fluorescent proteins, the following excitation/emission wavelengths were used: CFP (458/473–552), GFP (488/505–540), YFP (514/517–597), dsRed variants (561/565–615). For spectral unmixing of SR2200 and DAPI, images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM780NLO confocal microscopes equipped with a 32-channel GaAsP array for spectral detection (405/410–695) and processed with Zeiss ZEN software. Individual staining of Arabidopsis ovules with only SR2200 or DAPI, respectively, was performed to obtain reference spectra. 3D reconstructions and orthogonal sections were produced with ImageJ software.SpectroscopyEmission spectra of SR2200 and DAPI were recorded between 370 and 650 nm using a Jasco 6500 fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Samples were dissolved in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7. SR2200 (2 µl/ml) was measured in complex with pectin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.# P9135), DAPI in complex with Salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Scientific; 100 mg/ml).", "Staining protocol": "Staining protocolSR staining solution, containing 0.1 % (v/v) SR2200 (Renaissance Chemicals; stock solution of the supplier was considered as 100 %), 1 % (v/v) DMSO (Carl-Roth, Cat.#7029.2), 0.05 % (w/v) Triton-X100, 5 % (w/v) glycerol (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#G5516) and 4 % (w/v) para-formaldehyde (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Cat.#6148) in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) was prepared freshly prior to use.For imaging of developing embryos, immature seeds were collected in staining solution on a microscope slide and embryos were gently squeezed out of the ovule by applying pressure on a cover slip. Images of embryos were taken within 30 min after release from the ovules. For images of whole ovules and PTs, ovules were manually dissected out of the silique and collected in a drop of staining solution on a microscope slide. For better tissue penetration, soft vacuum was applied for 5 min at RT. Afterward, the staining solution was replaced by water and again incubated under soft vacuum for 5 min. After replacing the water with 10 % glycerol, the sample was mounted under a coverslip. After squeezing out of the ovule, torpedo stage embryos were processed in a similar fashion as whole ovules.", "Results": "ResultsStudying plant reproductive processes at cellular and subcellular resolution using fluorescence and confocal microscopy often requires staining of the plant cell wall to outline cells. Traditionally, PI and FM4-64 have been used for this purpose, but tissue penetration, uniform staining and signal intensity can be a problem with these dyes. Recently, SR2200 has been introduced for background staining in the Arabidopsis embryo (Robert et al. 2013; Smith and Long 2010; Wendrich et al. 2015). We realized that by using lower concentrations of SR2200 than previously reported, more uniform staining in deeper tissue layers can be achieved. Furthermore, the lower SR2200 concentration creates less background fluorescence and allows for direct imaging of the Arabidopsis embryo in the staining solution without further washing steps (Fig. 1). The addition of Triton-X100 and DMSO in combination with vacuum infiltration improved uniform staining of larger objects like whole ovules or torpedo stage embryos and enabled the dye to penetrate deep into the tissue, facilitating the construction of orthogonal optical sections and three-dimensional presentations (Fig. 1b–g, i and Movie S1 and S2). As an example, we stained embryos at the two-cell as well as four-cell stage which can easily be mistaken when imaged two-dimensionally. The orthogonal sections, however, clearly distinguish between the two stages of development (Fig. 1c, f). Furthermore, orthogonal views are essential to study radial patterning (Fig. 1i).With our staining protocol, Arabidopsis embryos up to torpedo stage can be uniformly stained, allowing optical tissue sections with cellular resolution without affecting the imaging of fluorescent proteins in the green and red spectrum (Fig. 1h–l). As examples, we used an enhancer trap line that displays ER-localized GFP signal in the pre-vasculature cells (Fig. 1j; Q0990≫GFP; Levesque et al. 2006; Weijers et al. 2006) and a pDR5rev::mRFPer line that shows transcriptional auxin responses by strong RFP expression at the root pole of the embryo as well as weaker expression at the cotyledon tips and in the vasculature (Friml et al. 2003; Gallavotti et al. 2008).The study of sexual reproductive biology of plants includes PT guidance and reception, gamete release and gamete fusion. Therefore, staining of the PT has long been a prerequisite to study these processes. The advent of new fluorescent marker lines that specifically label gamete cells has greatly facilitated our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena. It would therefore be advantageous to have a PT staining protocol that is compatible with the detection of fluorescent proteins. The cell wall of PTs is in addition to β-1,4-glucans also rich in β-1,3-glucans (Nishikawa et al. 2005). As an optical brightener of the stilbene family, SR2200 primarily labels β-1,4-glucans and β-1,3-glucans (Harris et al. 2002; Nicholas et al. 1994); we therefore wondered whether this dye would also be useful for PT staining. Accordingly, we found that SR2200 stains pollen cell walls very brightly; in fact it stains PTs stronger than the surrounding plant tissue making it possible to distinguish the two (Fig. 2a). To demonstrate the usefulness of our staining protocol, we analyzed the disturbed PT guidance in pod1-2 mutants (Li et al. 2011). As it has been reported before, the maximum projections of confocal image stacks clearly demonstrate that the PT continues to grow on the surface of the ovule without entering the micropyle (Fig. 2c; Li et al. 2011). To further highlight the use of SR2200 for PT staining, we analyzed feronia (fer-5) and wild-type ovules 30 h after pollination. In fer-5 ovules, the PT reception is disturbed and PTs continue to grow inside the ovule without releasing the sperm cells (Escobar-Restrepo et al. 2007; Huck et al. 2003). This can be easily visualized by SR2200 staining and opens the possibility to be combined with fluorescent marker lines (Fig. 2d). To demonstrate this, we pollinated the fer-5 line with a triple pollen marker, which expresses ER-localized CFP in the vegetative cell and labels the sperm nuclei with a histone HTR10-YFP fusion as well as a centromeric histone HTR12-mCherry fusion. We observed an ovule that was most likely a wild-type segregant and displayed the rare event of polytubey, e.g., that two PTs entered the micropyle simultaneously (Beale et al. 2012). SR2200 clearly stains two PTs targeting the same ovule (Fig. 2f). Both PTs obviously burst as shown by the release of CFP that was specifically expressed in the vegetative cell of the PT. Double fertilization has occurred as can be seen by labeling of the centromers in the triploid endosperm by centromeric histone HTR12-mCherry (Fig. 2f). Polyspermy on the other hand was prevented as the sperm cell pair released by the second PT can still be observed unfused next to the zygote (HTR10-YFP labeled). Therefore, our SR2200 staining protocol can be a useful alternative to aniline blue to study PT growth, guidance and reception, allowing for the simultaneous use of fluorescent proteins to label specific cell types or structures (Fig. 2a–f).In addition, whole ovules can be stained more or less uniformly, allowing the detailed study of the female gametophyte as well as ovule and seed development. To demonstrate this, we reproduced a recent finding by D. Maruyama and colleagues, who showed that rapid fusion of the persisting synergid with the central cell after fertilization prevents the attraction of further PTs (Maruyama et al. 2015). Synergid nuclei were specifically labeled by nuclear-localized tdtomato (pNTA≫NLS-tdtomato; Kong et al. 2015). Before fertilization, the fluorescent protein labels the synergid nuclei (Fig. 2g, h). After fertilization, the tdtomato signal can be observed in the nuclei of the developing endosperm, supporting the notion of a synergid-central cell fusion event (Fig. 2i). In this case, SR2200 staining is used to give a clear overview of the structures of the ovule with cellular resolution.The aforementioned examples demonstrate that SR2200 staining can be used in combination with a broad range of fluorescent proteins (CFP, GFP, YFP, tdtomato, mCherry; Figs. 1j–l, 2f–i) in a similar fashion as DAPI would be used with regard to excitation and detection.Since SR2200 is excited with the same laser line and has a rather similar emission spectrum as DAPI, we wondered whether this would exclude a combined use of these two dyes (Fig. 3a). With reference spectra recorded from individually stained samples, we were able to successfully separate DAPI and SR2200 signals from double-stained samples into separate channels by spectral unmixing (Figs. 1a–g, 3b–d). Taken together, our examples demonstrate that SR2200 can be used as fluorescence dye in combination with fluorescent proteins ranging in the emission spectrum from cyan (eCFP) to red (dsRed variants) as well as DAPI to study molecular events in sexual reproduction of plants and possibly other developmental processes."}, "stats": {"Abstract": {"chars": 1284, "tokens": 185, "source": "regular"}, "Materials and methods": {"chars": 5134, "tokens": 714, "source": "regular"}, "Staining protocol": {"chars": 1176, "tokens": 189, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 7065, "tokens": 1091, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Plant Reproduction", "year": "2015", "doi": "10.1007/s00497-015-0267-1", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Infected cells were selected by treatment with 1 μg/ml puromycin.For HIF‐1α overexpression in MDA‐MB‐231 cells, retroviral particles were produced by co‐transfection of recombinant shuttle vector pCL‐Eco and pBABE vectors (pBABE‐puro, HA‐HIF1α‐wt‐pBABE, HA‐HIF1α‐P402A/P564A‐pBABE).Generation of MCU −/− MDA‐MB‐231 cell linesTo generate MCU −/− MDA‐MB‐231 cell lines, two Cas9 guides targeting different regions of the human MCU gene were designed (TGGCGGCTGACGCCCAGCCC for clone1 and GATCGCTTCCTGGCAGAATT for clone2) and cloned into the BsmBI site of the LentiCrisprV2 plasmid, a kind gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #52961). MDA‐MB‐231 cells were infected with lentiviral particles produced as described above and selected with puromycin for one week. Dilution cloning was performed to obtain different monoclonal cell populations that were screened and validated for MCU gene ablation by Western blot. LentiCrisprV2 plasmid was used to produce control clones.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used: anti‐MCU (1:1,000, HPA016480, Sigma‐Aldrich), anti‐β‐tubulin (1:5,000, sc9104, Santa Cruz), anti‐HIF‐1α (1:500, 610958, Becton Dickinson), and anti‐hydroxy‐HIF‐1α (1:1,000, 3434, Cell Signaling).Ca2+ measurementsFor measurements of [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit, cells grown on 12‐mm round glass coverslips were infected with cytosolic (Ad‐cytAEQ) or low‐affinity mitochondrial (Ad‐mtAEQmut) probes, as described (Bonora et al, 2013). Forty‐eight hours later, cells were incubated with 5 μM coelenterazine for 2 h in Krebs‐Ringer modified buffer (KRB) (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na3PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) at 37°C supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, and transferred to the perfusion chamber, and Ca2+ transients were evoked by agonist treatments. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB, and agonists were added to the same medium.For SOCC activity measurements, cells grown on 12‐mm round glass coverslips were infected with Ad‐cytAEQ. Forty‐eight hours later cells were incubated with coelenterazine, as described above, and transferred to the perfusion chamber. After 1 min of perfusion with 100 μM EGTA in KRB, agonists and other drugs were added for 2 min, in order to empty intracellular Ca2+ stores. Next, cells were perfused with KRB containing 2 mM Ca2+ together with agonist or drugs, as indicated.All aequorin experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μM digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+‐rich solution (10 mM CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as previously described (Bonora et al, 2013).For measurements of resting mitochondrial [Ca2+], cells were grown on 24‐mm coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding 4mtGCaMP6f. After 24 h, coverslips were placed in 1 ml of KRB and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 40×/1.4 N.A. PlanFluar objective. Excitation was performed with a DeltaRAM V high‐speed monochromator (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp. Images were captured with a high‐sensitivity Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD (Photometrics). The system is controlled by MetaFluor 7.5 (Molecular Devices) and was assembled by Crisel Instruments. In order to perform quantitative measurements, we took advantage of the isosbestic point in the GCaMP6f excitation spectrum: we experimentally determined in living cells that exciting GCaMP6f at 410 nm leads to fluorescence emission, which is not Ca2+ dependent. As a consequence, the ratio between 474‐nm and 410‐nm excitation wavelengths is proportional to [Ca2+] while independent of probe expression (Hill et al, 2014). Cells were thus alternatively illuminated at 474 and 410 nm, and fluorescence was collected through a 515/30‐nm band‐pass filter (Semrock). Exposure time was set to 200 ms at 474 nm and to 400 ms at 410 nm, in order to account for the low quantum yield at the latter wavelength. At least 15 fields were collected per coverslip, and each field was acquired for 10 s (1 frame/s). Analysis was performed with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al, 2012). Both images were background corrected frame by frame by subtracting mean pixel values of a cell‐free region of interest. Data are presented as the mean of the averaged ratio of all time points.Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) measurementsCells were incubated with 20 nM tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester dye (TMRM) (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37°C. TMRM fluorescence was measured by FACS. The probe was excited at 560 nm, and the emission light was recorded in the 590–650 nm range; 10 μM FCCP (carbonyl cyanide‐p‐trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was added after 12 acquisitions to completely collapse the ∆Ψ. Data are expressed as difference of TMRM fluorescence before and after FCCP depolarization.Measurements of NADH/NADPH levels and redox stateFor fluorescence lifetime measurements, cells were plated onto 22‐mm glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight before imaging. At the microscope, coverslips were held at 37°C in a metal ring and bathed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) containing 25 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, buffered by 10 mM HEPES; 720‐nm two‐photon excitation from a Chameleon (Coherent) Ti:sapphire laser was directed through an upright LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 1.0 NA 40× water‐dipping objective. A 650‐nm short‐pass dichroic and 460 ± 25 nm emission filter separated NAD(P)H fluorescence from the incident illumination. On‐sample powers were kept below 10 mW, and emission events were registered by an external detector (HPM‐100, Becker & Hickl) attached to a commercial time‐correlated single‐photon counting electronics module (SPC‐830, Becker & Hickl). Scanning was performed continuously for 2 min with a pixel dwell time of 1.6 μs. Subsequent NAD(P)H FLIM data analysis was performed using the procedures detailed in Blacker et al (2014).For measuring NAD(P)H redox state, cells were plated as described above and imaged using a Zeiss 510 META UV‐VIS confocal microscope. The blue autofluorescence emitted by the pyridine nucleotides NADH and NADPH in their reduced form was excited with a UV laser (Coherent; at 351 nm), and emission was collected using a 435‐nm to 485‐nm band‐pass filter. To measure the dynamic range of the signal in relation to the fully reduced and oxidized NAD(P)H pool, cells were exposed to carbonyl cyanide 4‐(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP [1 μM] to stimulate respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H oxidation) and rotenone ([5 μM] to inhibit respiration and achieve maximum NAD(P)H reduction). The final formula used to normalize the NAD(P)H autofluorescence measurements was (F − FFCCP)/(Frotenone − F). Quantitative analysis of the images obtained was done using the ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).ROS production measurementsTo determine mitochondrial superoxide levels, cells were loaded with 2 mM MitoSOX™ Red reagent (Life Technologies) for 15 min at 37°C. Images were taken on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200) equipped with a PlanFluar 60×/1.4 NA objective, a Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD, and a 75 W Xenon arc lamp coupled to a monochromator (PTI Deltaram V). The system was assembled by Crisel Instruments. MitoSOX™ Red excitation was performed at ~510 nm, and emission was collected at 580 nm. Maximal ROS production was induced with 2.5 μM Antimycin‐A (Sigma‐Aldrich). Images were taken every 10 s with a fixed 200 ms exposure time. Data were analyzed by ImageJ software.To determine GSSG/GSH and H2O2 levels, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HyperRed, pLPCXmitGrx1‐roGFP2, and pHyPer‐dMito. To measure mitochondrial pH, SypHer2 plasmid was used. SypHer2 originates from a mutation in a cysteine residue of HyPer that renders it insensitive to H2O2 but does not affect the pH sensitivity. Images were acquired every 5 s using a Cell Observer High Speed (Zeiss) microscope equipped with 40× oil Fluar (N.A. 1.3) objective, CFP (Semrock HC), YFP and RFP (Zeiss) single‐band filters, 420 and 505 nm LED's (Colibri, Zeiss), and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Maximal ROS production was induced with 100 μM H2O2. To calculate fluorescence ratios, background intensity was subtracted and images were corrected for linear crosstalk. pHyPer‐dMito and pLPCXmitGrx1‐roGFP2 ratios were calculated by AxioVision software (Zeiss) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft). HyperRed fluorescence was analyzed by ImageJ software.Cell death and cell cycle detectionCell cycle and cell death induction after MCU silencing were measured by cytofluorometry. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were identified by labeling with FITC‐Annexin V (Roche) and propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C and analyzing cells by FACS (FACS Canto II, BD BioSciences). Data were processed using the BD Vista software.Wound healing migration assayFor wound healing assays, cells were seeded at low confluency (30%) in 6‐well plates, transfected with siRNA, and cultured in medium without serum. The day after, a linear scratch was obtained on cell monolayers through a vertically held P200 tip and medium was replaced. Images were taken at the indicated time points (time 0 as reference). “TScratch” software (www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/software/) was used for automated image analysis.Clonogenic assayTo evaluate clonogenic potential, transduced cells were counted and seeded (102 cells/cm2). Colonies were counted 7 days later. Only, colonies containing ≥ 30 cells were counted.ATP production measurementsATP production was measured with the ATPlite 1 step Luminescence Assay System (PerkinElmer) according to manufacturer's instructions. Glycolysis was inhibited by treatment with 5.5 mM 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose for 1 h.Spheroids formation assay15 × 102 cells/cm2 were seeded in a 96‐well plate containing 100 μl of 1.5% agar in PBS. Seventy‐two hours later, spheroids were harvested and collected in tubes filled with 1 ml of medium. Each tube contained five spheroids. Spheroids were let settle to the bottom of the tube, and medium was then sucked out. Spheroids were resuspended in 400 μl/well of a collagen mix solution (1.66 mM l‐glutamine, 10% FBS, 0.213% NaHCO3, 1% Pen/Strep, 2 mg/ml Collagen I Bovine Protein (Life Technologies) in MEM (Life Technologies)) and seeded in a 24‐well plate, previously filled with 300 μl/well of collagen mix solution. After collagen mix solidification, 1 ml of medium was added in each well. Images were collected every day, for 3 days, and the area of the spheroid cluster was analyzed by Fiji ImageJ software (time 0 as reference).RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative real‐time PCRRNA was extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was generated with a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) and analyzed by real‐time PCR (Bio‐Rad). HPRT‐1 and GAPDH were used as housekeeping genes. The following primers were used: HIF‐1α: FOR: TGTACCCTAACTAGCCGAGGAA_ REV: AATCAGCACCAAGCAGGTCATA HIF‐2α: FOR: AATGCAGTACCCAGACGGATTT_ REV: ATGTTTGTCATGGCACTGAAGC LOX: FOR: TCAGATTTCTTACCCAGCCGAC_ REV: TTGGCATCAAGCAGGTCATAGT PDK1: FOR: AATGCAAAATCACCAGGACAGC_ REV: ATTACCCAGCGTGACATGAACT G6PI: FOR: TTACTCCAAGAACCTGGTGACG_ REV: CTACCAGGATGGGTGTGTTTGA CAIX: FOR: TGGCTGCTGGTGACATCCTA_ REV: TTGGTTCCCCTTCTGTGCTG HK2: FOR: GTGCCCGCCAGAAGACATTA_ REV: TGCTCAGACCTCGCTCCATT HPRT‐1: FOR: TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA_ REV: GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT GAPDH: FOR: GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC_ REV: CCCCACTTGATTTTGGAGGGAT In vivo tumor assaysOne control and two independent MDA‐MB‐231 MCU −/− clones were transduced with a lentiviral vector coding for the Firefly Luciferase reporter gene (Breckpot et al, 2003).For orthotopic tumor assay, 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl DMEM and injected in the fat pad of six‐week‐old female SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). The volume of tumor mass was measured by calipering at specific time points. In vivo imaging was performed at the day of sacrifice (day 39 post‐injection for control, day 46 p.i. for MCU −/− clone1, and day 56 p.i. for MCU −/− clone2). D‐Luciferin (Biosynth AG) (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. to anesthetized animals. The light emitted from the bioluminescent tumors or metastasis was detected using a cooled charge‐coupled device camera mounted on a light‐tight specimen box (IVIS Lumina II Imaging System; Caliper Life Sciences). Regions of interest from displayed images were identified around metastatic regions, such as lymph nodes and lungs, and were quantified as total photon counts or photon/s using Living Image® software (Xenogen). In some experiments, the lower portion of each animal was shielded before reimaging in order to minimize the bioluminescence from primary tumor. For ex vivo imaging, D‐Luciferin (150 mg/kg) was injected i.p. immediately before necropsy. The lungs were excised, placed in a Petri plate, and imaged for 5 min. Animals were randomized before experiments, and no blinding was done. Procedures involving animals and their care were in accordance with the Italian law D. L.vo no 26/2014, and the experimental protocol (Authorization n. 8584/2012‐PR) was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.Bioinformatics analysisTo evaluate the correlation of the expression of MCU complex components with tumor progression, median‐centered log2 mRNA expression levels of MCUa (NM_138357.2), MCUb (CCDC109b, NM_017918.4), MICU1 (NM_006077.3), MICU2 (NM_152726.2), MICU3 (NM_181723.2), and EMRE (SMDT1, NM_033318.4) were compiled from the TCGA breast cancer dataset (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/brca_2012/) (Koboldt et al, 2012). Linear regression analysis of individual expression values with the corresponding tumor size (T1–T4) and lymph node (N0–N3) stages was done in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc.).To quantify correlation of MCU mRNA levels with HIF‐1α and a HIF‐1α‐regulated gene set, linear models have been constructed in R, and prediction values were analyzed against MCU expression levels using linear regression analysis (GraphPad). The HIF‐1α‐regulated gene set was compiled from the Broad Institute GSEA database (merged sets of V$HIF1_Q3 and V$HIF1_Q5, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/cards/V$HIF1_Q5.html).Constructing linear models to predict correlations between MCU and HIF‐1α and a HIF‐1α‐regulated gene setTo test whether the expression of members of the MCU complex was predictive of HIF‐1α expression, two linear models were created. One to predict the expression of HIF‐1α from members of the MCU complex and the other to predict the average expression of HIF‐1α‐regulated genes. Both linear models were found to be highly statistically significant (P‐values 5.67e‐12 for predicting HIF‐1α and 2.48e‐22 for predicting HIF‐1α‐regulated genes), but these models predict only a relatively small amount of the variation in the data with adjusted R 2 values of 0.1099 and 0.1927, respectively. In both models, some members of the MCU complex were found to be more predictive than others. For instance, for predicting the expression of HIF‐1α, MCU is the most predictive with a P‐value of the expression of MCU not being relevant for predicting HIF‐1α was 3.83e‐06, while for predicting the average of HIF‐1α‐regulated genes, expression of MICU2 was most significant with a P‐value of 4.57e‐12.

Statistical tests applied are indicated in the figure legends.Sample size determinationFisher's exact test has been applied to determine the probability of detecting differences in the following end points: In vivo studies: a total number of nine mice for each experimental condition were analyzed in order to detect the expected variation in terms of probability of tumor growth and metastasis formation between treatment conditions, with statistical power of 0.85 and assuming a significance threshold corresponding to P < 0.05. A priori sample size determinations were performed by the GPower3.1 (www.gpower.hhu.de/) software tool and by a simulation based approach. In vitro studies: data available in our laboratory to define the variance of the results were adopted. We have assumed a statistical power of 85% and a significance level of P < 0.05 applying the Bonferroni correction whenever required."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 394, "tokens": 53, "source": "regular"}, "Materials and Methods": {"chars": 20151, "tokens": 2847, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "EMBO Molecular Medicine", "year": "2016", "doi": "10.15252/emmm.201606255", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Inactivation of synpcc7942_2071, which encodes a homolog of subunit E of type II secretion systems (T2SE), results in a mutant (T2SEΩ) that adheres to the growth tube in contrast to the planktonic phenotype of the WT strain (Fig. 1a). Analyses by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1b) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM, Fig. 1c) substantiate biofilm development by T2SEΩ (see Schatz et al.33 for additional cryo-SEM as well as environmental-SEM analyses).We previously demonstrated that the gene Synpcc7942_1134 is required for biofilm formation by S. elongatus33. The product of this gene exhibits an N-terminal secretion motif (denoted GG-motif) typical of bacterial antibiotics, e.g. microcins. Such proteins undergo maturation during secretion by cleavage of the secretion motif after a conserved glycine-glycine (or glycine-alanine, as in the case of Synpcc7942_1134) motif 3839. Wang et al.40 identified three previously unannotated open reading frames located immediately upstream of Synpcc7942_1134, the putative products of which are also characterized by a GG-motif40 (also see Fig. 2a,b). These gene products are referred to here as EbfG1-4. The putative precursors encoded by these genes are approximately 9–10 kDa, with 6–7 kDa remaining after their maturation by removal of the secretion motif40. Proteins possessing GG-motifs are prevalent in cyanobacteria40; however, mature EbfG1-4 of S. elongatus do not show homology to proteins from other cyanobacteria or exhibit domains of known function.To test whether the GG-motifs of EbfG1-4 are required for biofilm development we combined mutations in these loci with mutation of Synpcc7942_2071 (T2SEΩ strain). The T2SEΩ mutation alone results in a culture in which about 5% of the total chlorophyll is present in suspended cells (Fig. 2a), while the remaining chlorophyll resides in biofilm-forming cells attached to the bottom and sides of the culture vessel. Deletion of ebfG1-4 in the context of the T2SEΩ mutation completely abolished biofilm formation, with 100% of the chlorophyll present in suspended cells, similar to the WT (Fig. 2a, T2SEΩ/Δ4). Recombination of a DNA fragment bearing the genes ebfG1-4 into the genome at neutral site 1 (NS1) complements the phenotype of T2SEΩ/Δ4, restoring biofilm formation to the level observed in T2SEΩ (Fig. 2a, T2SEΩ/Δ4/comp).To examine whether the GG-motifs in EbfG1-4 are required for biofilm formation, we altered the trans-complementing DNA fragment to separately modify each GG-motif to AA. For example, introduction of DNA encoding a modified EbfG1 GG-motif (with EbfG2-4 sequences unchanged) only partially restored biofilm development to the completely planktonic T2SEΩ/Δ4 strain (Fig. 2a, T2SEΩ/Δ4/EbfG1m). On average, 60% of the total chlorophyll was found in suspended cells, significantly more than the 2–5% found inT2SEΩ or T2SEΩ/∆4/comp (see Table S1 for p-values). Similarly, modification of the GG-motif of EbfG2 or EbfG4 to AA (Fig. 2a, T2SEΩ/Δ4/EbfG2m and T2SEΩ/Δ4/EbfG4m, respectively) in the complementing DNA fragment partially restored biofilm development to the T2SEΩ/Δ4 strain (50–70% chlorophyll in suspended cells). In contrast, mutation of the GG-motif in EbfG3 only slightly interfered with biofilm development; in this case just 15% of the chlorophyll was in the planktonic cells (Fig. 2a, compare T2SEΩ/Δ4/EbfG3m and T2SEΩ/∆4/comp). When the GG-motifs in all four proteins were mutated simultaneously, biofilm development was completely abolished (Fig. 2a, T2SEΩ/Δ4/Quad). In summary, these data support the suggestion that each of the GG-motifs contributes to biofilm formation. Furthermore, because the combination of the four mutations completely abrogated biofilm development, whereas each individual mutation only partially interfered with biofilm formation, we suggest functional redundancy between EbfG1-4.Transcripts of ebfG1-4 are highly abundant in T2SEΩDifferences in transcript levels from the ebfG1-4 genes between the WT and T2SEΩ were followed using RT-qPCR. Initially, T2SEΩ grows planktonically; however, biofilms start forming, usually on the third day of growth. Transcript levels of ebfG1-4 in T2SEΩ 1 day after inoculation into fresh medium were 14–37 fold higher compared to WT (Fig. 3a, day 1 Fresh Medium). Once biofilms formed, the sessile as well as the planktonic cells of the mutant were characterized by significantly higher levels of these transcripts compared to 1 day old mutant cultures (Fig. 3a, T2SEΩ Fresh Medium). The fact that transcripts of ebfG1-4 are similarly elevated in planktonic and biofilm forming cells of T2SEΩ at 3 and 6 days (Fig. 3a, 3P, 3BF, 6P, 6BF) suggests that high transcript levels of these genes are not by themselves sufficient to drive biofilm development.Extracellular fluids from a WT culture (hereafter, conditioned medium) inhibit biofilm development of T2SEΩ33. Inoculation of the T2SEΩ mutant into conditioned medium significantly reduced ebfG1-4 transcript levels during the first day of growth, as compared to T2SEΩ at the same growth stage in fresh medium. Further growth of T2SEΩ in conditioned medium resulted in increased transcript levels of ebfG1-4 compared to day 1, but did not reach the levels detected in biofilm forming cells of this mutant (Fig. 3a). In two cases, ebfG1 and ebfG4, the transcript levels after 6 days were not significantly different between planktonic T2SEΩ cells grown in fresh medium and those grown in conditioned medium, indicating that conditioned medium results in expression levels of these genes consistent with planktonic cells but not with biofilm forming cells.The similar trends of transcriptional changes of ebfG1-4 suggested that these genes are co-regulated. Using the primers indicated in Fig. 2a for RT-PCR, we detected a polycistronic transcript containing ebfG1-4 (Fig. 3b). Likely due to low expression in WT, this transcript was not previously identified in RNA-seq of S. elongatus by Vijayan et al.41. The mechanism underlying regulation of these genes is yet unknown.A cysteine peptidase is required for efficient secretion of EbfG1-4Using insertional inactivation, we previously demonstrated that the gene Synpcc7942_1133 is essential for biofilm development33. The protein encoded by this gene is characterized by a peptidase domain of the ‘C39 family’ (Fig. 4a), named after the conserved cysteine residue essential for transport and maturation of precursor substrates that possess a GG-motif4243. Akin to the analysis performed with the GG-motifs, a mutational complementation approach was employed to examine the requirement for a functional peptidase domain to enable biofilm development. The double mutant T2SEΩ/1133Ω exhibits a planktonic phenotype33 (Fig. 4b). Biofilm development was restored when a DNA fragment bearing Synpcc7942_1133 was combined with the T2SEΩ/1133Ω double mutation (Fig. 4b, T2SEΩ/1133Ω/comp). Replacement of the conserved cysteine residue with alanine in this trans-complementing DNA fragment, however, completely abolished biofilm formation (Fig. 4b, T2SEΩ/1133Ω/PteBm), in agreement with the hypothesis that the protein encoded by Synpcc7942_1133 (denoted PteB for peptidase transporter essential for biofilm) is involved in the secretion of EbfG1-4.To test whether PteB is required for secretion of the small GG-motif proteins of S. elongatus, we analyzed the extracellular fluids of the strains T2SEΩ/1133Ω/comp and T2SEΩ/1133Ω/PteBm for the presence of these secreted proteins. The control strain T2SEΩ/1133Ω/comp forms biofilms similarly to T2SEΩ and likely has high transcript levels for ebfG1-4. Comparative analyses by mass spectrometry indicated significantly higher levels of peptides derived from EbfG1-4 in the conditioned media of the biofilm forming strain T2SEΩ/1133Ω/comp as compared to that of the planktonic strain T2SEΩ/1133Ω/PteBm, which possesses the cysteine to alanine mutation (Fig. 5). The presence of some of the peptides in extracellular fluids from T2SEΩ/1133Ω/PteBm cultures may be due to cell lysis. It is also possible that the cysteine to alanine mutation does not completely abrogate PteB function and some secretion and maturation does occur in the mutant. This potential activity, however, is insufficient to support biofilm development because the T2SEΩ/1133Ω/PteBm grows planktonically (Fig. 4b).Of note, the peptides TTYNPPSYPYPSYPK (EbfG1), SGYSIPTYPK (EbfG2) and LLQTANSVAAAIAK (EbfG4) were detected by mass spectrometry in conditioned media. Unlike all other peptides detected in these analyses, which represent cleavage by the trypsin or chymotrypsin peptidases used for sample digestion prior to analysis, these three peptides likely represent cleavage of the secretion motif, because in the putative precursor protein they are preceded by GG (EbfG1 and EbfG2) or GA in the case of EbfG4 (see Fig. S1) and not by an amino acid typically preceding trypsin or chymotrypsin cleavage sites. These data provide support for maturation and secretion of these small proteins by removal of the secretion motif. In summary, the mutational approach and the mass spectrometry analyses support the suggestion that efficient secretion of EbfG1-4 is required for biofilm development, and that the peptidase domain of PteB is involved in the secretion process.", "Methods": "MethodsStrains, culture conditions, biofilm quantification, and microscopySynechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and all derived strains were grown essentially as described previously33. Specifically, 25 ml cultures were grown in round-bottom Pyrex tubes (20 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter). Cotton-plugged Pasteur pipette (23 cm long) inserted through a sponge-plug served for bubbling of 3% CO2 in air into the cultures. The tip of the Pasteur pipette was placed 1–2 cm above the bottom of the tube. Prior to bubbling into the culture, the gas was humidified by passing through a bottle with double distilled water and filtered using 0.22 μm filter. BG11 medium45 served for culturing; however, to reproducibly observe biofilm formation, it was important to add the ferric ammonium citrate and citric acid components (final concentrations 0.0226 and 0.0312 mM, respectively) from freshly made stocks. Autoclaved BG11 was used within 4 days to inoculate cultures. Cultures were grown at 30 °C and under incandescent light (20–30 μmol photons m−2 sec−1).For assessment of biofilm formation, cells were cultured under continuous bubbling. Experiments were initiated by diluting cultures at the exponential phase of growth to an optical density at 750 nm of 0.5. Biofilm development under this setting typically initiated following 2–3 days of growth and quantification was performed after 7 days to allow assessment of fully developed biofilms (longer growth time did not increase biofilm development). Percentage of chlorophyll in suspended cells served to quantity biofilm formation as follows. The suspended fraction was sampled for chlorophyll determination by extraction in 80% acetone (final concentration). In cases were the suspended fraction appeared especially dense (planktonic strains or poor biofilm formers), a 0.2 mL sample was used for extraction. When robust biofilms were formed, 15 mL of planktonic cells were removed and concentrated 3 to 6-fold by centrifugation (5000 g, 10 min) prior the chlorophyll extraction in 80% acetone. Determination of chlorophyll in the biofilm was performed following removal of the planktonic cells using a pipette and addition of 80% acetone to the sessile cells. Extraction was carried out over-night in the refrigerator. Dilution in 80% acetone was performed to reach the linear range of the calibration curve and chlorophyll was quantified based on absorbance at 663 nm. For statistical analysis of comparisons of chlorophyll in suspension we employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post analysis multiple comparison contrasts (see statistical grouping in Figs 2 and 4 and Tables S1 and S3 for p-values).For collection of conditioned medium, cultures were centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed and passed through a 0.22 μm filter. Supplementation with nutrients by addition of medium stock solutions as in the preparation of fresh growth medium was performed when the conditioned medium served for cyanobacterial growth.For microscopic analysis of biofilms, microscope slides were inserted into growth tubes containing T2SEΩ cultures (for 6 days) so that biofilms formed on the slides. A Leica TCS SPE DM2500 was employed for imaging by fluorescence microscopy using objective HCX APO l 40x/0.80 (excitation 532 nm, emission 620–650 nm). 3D image reconstruction was performed using Imaris. Analysis by SEM was described previously33.Genetic manipulations of cyanobacterial cellsInsertional inactivation of genes Synpcc7942_2071 (t2sE), Synpcc7942_1134 (ebfG4), and Synpcc7942_1133 was described previously33. In the case of deletion of ebfG1 through ebfG4 (∆4), disruption was obtained by deletion of the fragment between the NheI and ClaI sites. Resulting constructs were introduced into S. elongatus using standard transformation methods that take advantage of its natural competence46. Mutant cyanobacterial clones resistant to the appropriate antibiotic were confirmed for double homologous recombination (allele replacement) and complete chromosomal segregation using PCR on genomic DNA. Primers and additional cloning information are provided in Table S4. Inactivation of t2SE impaired the natural DNA competence of S. elongatus; thus, to obtain T2SEΩ strains with additional genetic changes, we initially introduced the other genetic modifications and subsequently inactivated t2sE.Vectors used to introduce the WT and mutated complementation DNA fragments into NS1 were generated using the GeneArt® Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Life Technologies) on PCR-generated cloning fragments and standardized devices (a chloramphenicol resistance device and a NS1 device with tetracycline resistance) derived via ZraI or EcoRV-HF (New England Biolabs) restriction digestion of CYANO-VECTOR donor plasmids as described by Taton et al.47. To improve the efficiency of cloning, the 6-kb WT DNA fragment was constructed from two 3-kb fragments amplified with the Q5® High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). To introduce glycine- or cysteine to alanine mutations, the appropriate cloning fragment was assembled from subfragments; these segments were generated using seamless assembly cloning primers designed to introduce the appropriate base mutations at the center of the overlap between subfragments. Combining multiple such subfragments or generating subfragments from previously mutated vectors allowed the generation of the quadruple GG-mutation vector. The sequence of each vector was confirmed. These vectors were used to transform S. elongatus strains as described above. For additional information see Table S4 and Fig. S2.Mass spectrometry analysisConditioned medium was harvested as described above. Mass spectrometry was performed by the de Botton Institute for Protein Profiling at The Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalized Medicine (Weizmann Institute of Science).Sample preparationCulture supernatants were concentrated ~20 fold on 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff-filters. Proteins were reduced by incubation with dithiothreitol (5 mM; Sigma) for 45 min at 60 °C, and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark for 45 min at 21 °C. Proteins were then subjected to digestion with trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI, USA, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 4 h at 37 °C followed by digestion with chymotrypsin (Sigma, ratio of 50:1 protein amount:enzyme amount) for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestions were stopped by trifluroacetic acid (1%). Following digestion, peptides were desalted using solid-phase extraction columns (Oasis HLB, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The samples were stored in −80 °C until further analysis.Liquid chromatographyULC/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi nanoAcquity; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase C18 trapping column (180 μm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 μm particle size; Waters). The peptides were then separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 μm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 μm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 μL/min. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 4% to 30% B in A (vol/vol) in 105 min, 35% to 90% B in A in 5 min, maintained at 95% for 5 min and then back to initial conditions.Mass SpectrometryThe nano Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 μm tip; New Objective; Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon). For initial identification, data were acquired in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top20 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time was set to 20 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500 and maximum injection time of 60 msec. For targeted analysis, data was acquired in Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) mode, monitoring previously identified peptides from EbfG1-4. MS2 resolution was set to 35,000 (at 400 m/z) and maximum injection time of 100 msec.Data processing and analysisFor identification purposes, raw data was first processed using Proteome Discoverer v1.41. MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot v2.4 (Matrix Sciences) and Sequest HT. Data were searched against the S. elongatus protein database as downloaded from UniprotKB (http://www.uniprot.org/), appended with EbfG1-4, along with 125 common laboratory contaminant proteins. Fixed modification was set to carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modification was set to oxidation of methionines. Search results were then imported back to Expressions to annotate identified peaks. Proteins were then grouped based on shared peptides and Identifications were filtered such that the global false discovery rate was maximum of 1%. For PRM analysis, raw data and DDA search results were imported into the Skyline software (https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/). The software was used for retention time alignment, peak detection of peptide fragments and their quantification.Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric test, because the majority of the data (or any viable transformation of it) are not normally distributed.RNA preparation and RT-PCRRNA was prepared as previously described48 and treated with DNase (TURBO DNase, Ambion). Random hexamers (Promega) were used to prime cDNA using 1.5 μg RNA and reverse transcriptase (RevertAid, Fermentas). PCR amplification was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with addition of betaine pH 9.0 (final concentration of 0.525M) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Melting curve analysis was performed (65 to 95 °C, 0.5 °C/5s) to confirm amplification of a single cDNA sequence for each gene. Primer dimers or unexpected amplicons were not observed. No signals were detected in the negative controls (samples in which reverse transcriptase was not added). Specific primers for RT-qPCR and RT-PCR of the ebfG1-4 transcript are indicated in Table S4. Transcript levels of psbC, encoding CP43, a chlorophyll binding protein of photosystem II, served to normalize total RNA levels.For statistical analysis we employed three factor ANOVA to calculate the covariance (normality and equality of variances were tested using Kruskal-Wallis & Levene’s tests respectively, both found to be >0.05). Next, we used multiple comparison contrasts to evaluate the differences of each pair of comparison. In each bar graph in Fig. 3a, different letters assign statistical significance (see Table S2 for p-values)."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 9697, "tokens": 1404, "source": "regular"}, "Methods": {"chars": 10842, "tokens": 1589, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2016", "doi": "10.1038/srep32209", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Thus, two CRISPR guide RNAs were designed to target exons 1 and 2 of osteocalcin to disrupt the protein early in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C). The CRISPR guide RNA and Cas9 mRNA mixtures were microinjected into the pronuclei of 33 fertilized embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats and transferred to pseudopregnant female rats, of which 21 pups were born (64%). Multiple alleles result in complete loss of osteocalcin proteinGenotyping was performed by amplifying a 601-bp fragment encompassing the CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) target sites from tail genomic DNA samples, followed by a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA). Based on HMA profiles, the presence of indels was identified in 12 of 21 (58%) pups (Fig. 2A) born from the first set of microinjected embryos. The alleles were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which revealed frameshift mutations. Multiple alleles were present in many founder animals and indicated mosaicism (Fig. 2B). Founders 1 and 19 were mated to each other in order to establish germline transmission of mutant alleles including a 7-bp insertion (+7), a compound 2-bp insertion and a 15-bp deletion (+2–15), and a 312-bp deletion (–312). A second set of pups born from the CRISPR microinjection yielded an additional founder animal that transmitted a 240-bp deletion (–240, data not shown). All of these alleles were predicted to cause frameshift mutations resulting in premature stop codons (Fig. 2C). Total loss of osteocalcin protein was demonstrated by complete loss of both γ-carboxylated (Gla-) and uncarboxylated (Glu-) forms of osteocalcin in the serum of the osteocalcin-null male rats as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 2D). Western blots of tissue samples (brain, heart, lung, bone, gonadal fat, subcutaneous fat, quadriceps muscle, liver, kidney, pancreas and spleen) from wild-type animals demonstrated that osteocalcin was only expressed in bone (data not shown); there was no osteocalcin detectable in any of these tissues taken from a homozygous 312-bp deletion (–312) F2 generation animal as expected (data not shown). Loss of osteocalcin protein in the null mutant animals was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry on sectioned femurs (Fig. 2E) and by western blot analyses of protein isolated from whole tibiae of animals with compound heterozygous combinations of these alleles (Fig. 2F), in contrast to the robust signal from wild-type animals. Loss of osteocalcin does not affect body composition5-month-old wild-type and osteocalcin-null male rats were scanned by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for total body composition. Total body weight, the percentage fat mass, percentage lean mass, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were not significantly different (Fig. 3A–E). Gonadal fat pads were excised from the males of each cohort and weighed. There was no significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 3F). Loss of osteocalcin results in differences in glucose and insulin toleranceFasting glucose measurements were assessed from fresh tail blood in 5-month-old male rats of osteocalcin-null and wild-type rats immediately prior to challenge with glucose or insulin for glucose and insulin tolerance tests, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups for the fasting glucose level (Fig. 4A; P=0.2080); however, at 75 min after insulin injection the groups began to diverge (Fig. 4B,C), indicating an increase in insulin sensitivity in osteocalcin-null animals (10.04±0.70 mg dl−1 and 13.00±0.73 mg dl−1 for null versus WT animals, respectively; mean±s.e.m., P=0.0337). Consistent with an increase in insulin sensitivity, osteocalcin-null animals exhibited significantly lower blood glucose levels at 30 min post glucose injection (Fig. 4D,E; 16.62±0.73 mg dl−1 versus 18.34±1.38 mg dl−1, respectively; P=0.0279). Loss of osteocalcin affects trabecular bone measurementsOsteocalcin-null and wild-type control animals were sacrificed at 5 months of age and the femurs excised for further analysis by microcomputed tomography (μCT). Cortical bone volume (P=0.2585), percentage bone volume (P=0.3378), thickness (P=0.2876), density (P=0.0845), and average periosteal circumference (P=0.7865) and endosteal circumference (P=0.4144) were not significantly different between groups (Fig. 5A–G). For trabecular bone, there was an increase in bone volume in osteocalcin-null rats compared to control animals (4.96±0.35 mm3 and 6.35±0.44 mm3, respectively; P=0.0316) (Fig. 6B). Trabecular bone measurements in null animals also differed significantly from wild-type in percentage bone volume (P=0.0035), thickness (P=0.0021) and density (P=0.0004) (Fig. 6C–E). Trabecular separation (P=0.2130) and number (P=0.1332) were not different between groups (Fig. 6F,G). Loss of osteocalcin affects femoral biomechanicsExcised femurs from 5-month-old male wild-type and osteocalcin-null rats were subjected to a three-point break assay to determine the strength and stiffness of the bone. This assay revealed that there was a significant increase in the maximum force needed to break the femurs of osteocalcin-null rats compared to wild-type animals (196.2±7.62 N and 165.5±5.93 N, respectively; mean±s.e.m., P=0.0118) (Fig. 7A). The osteocalcin-null animals also had a significant increase in stiffness (347.6±22.97 N mm−1 versus 274±23.78 N mm−1; P=0.0492) (Fig. 7D). There was no difference in deflection or energy to Fmax (Fig. 7B,C; P=0.6233 versus 0.8405, respectively).", "Loss of osteocalcin results in differences in glucose and insulin tolerance": "Loss of osteocalcin results in differences in glucose and insulin toleranceFasting glucose measurements were assessed from fresh tail blood in 5-month-old male rats of osteocalcin-null and wild-type rats immediately prior to challenge with glucose or insulin for glucose and insulin tolerance tests, respectively.

Rbglap-CRISPR1 (Exon 1, reverse strand) was 5′-CAGAGAGGCAGAATGCAGTCAGG-3′; Rbglap-CRISPR2 (Exon 2, reverse strand) was 5′-TTTGTCAGACTCAGAGTCGCTGG-3′ [nucleotides in italics represent the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), the sequence required for CRISPR/Cas9 targeting]. Annealed oligonucleotides encoding the guideRNA were cloned into a plasmid vector (Hwang et al., 2013) and confirmed by sequencing. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were generated using the Ampliscribe T7 RNA transcription kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) and purified. Cas9 mRNA was in vitro transcribed using the pCS2-nCas9n plasmid (gift of Wenbiao Chen, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, USA; Jao et al., 2013) and SP6 in vitro transcription kit (CellScript Inc., Madison, WI). The final concentration of Cas9 mRNA and CRISPR sgRNA in the injection solution were 25 ng µl−1 and 50 ng µl−1, respectively.GonadotropinsFemale Sprague-Dawley rat embryo donors from 3 weeks of age to adulthood were administered 20 IU of PMSG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 3 days prior to the day taken as conception followed by 30 IU of HCG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) 2 days later to induce superovulation. At 5 days prior to the day taken as conception recipient Sprague-Dawley female rats over 8 weeks of age were administered 40 IU of LHRHa (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to synchronize estrous cycles. Donor and recipient females were mated to stud and vasectomized Sprague Dawley males, respectively, on one day prior to the day taken as conception.Collection of embryosAt day 0.5 post-conception, the synchronized donor female was humanely sacrificed using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. The animal was placed in dorsal recumbency and the abdomen was liberally scrubbed with betadine. The abdomen was carefully opened to expose the abdominal cavity and the uterine horns were sequentially grasped carefully with blunt forceps to allow tracing to the corresponding ovary. The oviduct was isolated, excised, and flushed with sterile medium to expose the cumulus masses containing fertilized embryos. Embryos were cultured in KSOM (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) prior to microinjection.MicroinjectionFertilized embryos were placed in M2 medium (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and covered in embryo-tested mineral oil on a Leitz/Leica Laborlux S Nomarski DIC microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The CRISPR/Cas9 solution was injected directly into the pronuclei using an injection needle and holding pipette controlled by micromanipulators.Embryo transferInstruments were sterilized by bead sterilization for 5 s. Anesthesia was induced in the recipient rat by placement in a chamber with 1.0–1.5 l min−1 of 5% isoflurane with oxygen as a carrier gas and maintained during surgery with 3% isoflurane by placement of the nose of the pre-anesthetized rat in a nose cone after subcutaneous injection of 0.10 ml of 0.3 mg ml−1 buprenorphine (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Richmond, VA) and 0.2 ml of 5 mg ml−1carprofen (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). The lower back of the recipient rat was shaved above the left uterine horn, and placed on a sterile tissue on the stage of the microscope. The oviduct was exposed through an incision in the abdominal wall. The manipulated embryos were then injected into the oviduct by gentle pressure through the pipette into the ostium of the oviduct. The reproductive tract was then carefully replaced in the abdomen, the abdomen was closed using suture in the body wall, and the skin was closed with a single wound clip. Post-surgical analgesics were provided [subcutaneous injection 0.2 ml carprofen (5 mg ml−1) after 24 h].Animal identificationAnimals were identified by cage card, sex and through unique ‘ear tags’ consecutively numbered that were affixed at weaning.BiopsiesTail biopsies were performed when animals were weaned. A 5–7 mm portion of the distal segment of the tail was cut and the remainder cauterized for analysis. Genomic DNA was purified from the lysed tail samples.Identification of foundersFounder animals were identified by PCR using primers flanking the target loci that amplified a 601-bp fragment in wild-type animals (Rnbglap-genF1, 5′-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3′; Rnbglap-genR1, 5′-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3′). Positive samples were confirmed by modified Sanger sequencing. Heteroduplex formation of amplified fragments was facilitated by denaturing the PCR samples at 95°C for 10 min and slowly cooling the samples to 4°C over ∼20 min to enable renaturation. The re-annealed samples, which included homoduplexes and heteroduplexes, were run on 6% polyacrylamide-TBE gels at 100 V for 45 min before staining with ethidium bromide to visualize bands under UV light. Samples showing heteroduplex mobility shifts were cloned into a plasmid vector (pCR 2.1) using the TOPO-TA kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Recombinant plasmids with inserts were isolated and subjected to Sanger sequencing to obtain sequence information of modified alleles.Genotyping procedureThe following PCR primer sets were used to identify the indel alleles found in F0, F1 and F2 animals: Rnbglap-genF1, 5′-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3′ and Rnbglap-genR1, 5′-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3′ (601 bp); Rnbglap-genF2, 5′-AAGTCCCACACAGCAACTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genR2, 5′-CGGAGTCTATTCACCACCTTAC-3′ (474 bp); and Rnbglap-genR3, 5′-CTCTCTGGTAGTTTGTCCCTTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genF3, 5′-CACAGCATCCTTTGGGTTTG-3 (329 bp).Western blottingTissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold T-PER lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a protease inhibitor tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). For immunoblotting, protein was loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and separated by electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at 100 V for 50 min, and crosslinked using 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight with a monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves, et al. (2013)] diluted 1:2500 at 4°C, followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG secondary antibody. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical analyses of osteocalcin was performed as previously described (Cook et al., 2013). Briefly, excised femurs were submerged in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for fixation before decalcification with 10% EDTA and paraffin embedment. 5-μm-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded decalcified femoral tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed and boiled for 20 min in a diluted (1:30), pH 9.0 antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were incubated in a horse serum blocking solution (ImmPRESS system, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h followed by incubation with monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody [1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat. no. ab13420, validated in rat in Esteves et al. (2013)] in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibody (ImmPRESS, Vector Laboratories) was applied and slides were incubated in DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate solution (Dako). Each slide was then incubated with Harris hematoxylin counterstain (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells positive for osteocalcin stained brown.DXAIn vivo body composition of the rats was assessed using the GE Lunar Prodigy DXA with Small Animal Software (GE, Madison, WI; v.6.10) as previously described and validated (Moreau et al., 2001; Bertin et al., 1998). The rats were anesthetized with a constant flow of 4% isoflurane in oxygen. They were then placed in a prostrated position on the DXA and scanned using the Small Animal Software (v.6.10). Each scan took ∼5 min and the resulting data were analyzed by drawing a region of interest that included the entire rat. Data obtained from this scan included total body fat mass, lean mass, BMD and BMC.Insulin tolerance test and glucose tolerance testRats were fasted for 4 h prior to the ITT conducted in the afternoon and overnight prior to the GTT conducted in the morning. After the fast, the rats were weighed and placed in a clear restraint tube which allowed easy access to the tail for blood sampling. The tip of the tail (1 mm) was cut with a scalpel for the baseline sample. Blood was collected from this same point throughout the test, without needing to cut the tail again. Approximately 2 µl of blood per read was analyzed for glucose content using the Alphatrak analyzer and strips (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). Insulin or glucose was injected into the peritoneal cavity after the baseline glucose measurement and blood glucose was measured at the following time points post injection: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min. Doses of insulin and glucose were dependent on the glucose status of the animals and were 0.75 IU kg−1 and 1.50 mg g−1, respectively.µCTWild-type littermates and osteocalcin-null rats of 5 months of age were sacrificed and their femurs were dissected. Excised rat femurs were scanned using the Scanco µCT40 desktop cone-beam µCT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). The femur was placed inverted in a 20-mm diameter scanning holder and scanned at the following settings: 20-mm resolution, 70 kVp and 114 µA with an integration time of 200 ms. Scans were automatically reconstructed into 2D slices and all slices were analyzed using the µCT Evaluation Program (v.6.5-2, Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). For the cortical analysis, the bone was scanned at the midshaft of the bone for a scan of 50 slices. The region of interest (ROI) was drawn on every slice and fitted to the outside of the cortical bone, to include all the bone and marrow. The threshold for cortical bone was set at 316 (grayscale value). The 3D reconstruction was performed using all of the outlined slices. Data were obtained on bone volume (BV), total volume (TV), BV/TV, bone density and cortical thickness. An additional analysis was performed using the software to measure the periosteal circumference using the same outlines. For the analysis of endosteal circumferences, a new ROI was drawn and fitted to the inside of the cortical bone. The same analysis was then performed as for the periosteal circumference. For the trabecular bone, the scan was started distal to the growth plate and consisted of 312 slices. The region of interest started at the point on the scan where the condyles ended. From this point, 200 slices were outlined on the inside of the cortical bone, enclosing only the trabecular bone and marrow. Trabecular bone was thresholded at 211 (grayscale value) and the 3D analysis performed on the 200 slices. Data were obtained on trabecular bone volume, total volume, thickness, density, separation and number.Biomechanical strength testingThree-point bending tests were completed using an MTS 858 MiniBionix (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) equipped with a 15,000 N load cell (calibrated to 1500 N). Upon killing, the femurs were harvested, cleaned of soft tissues, wrapped in saline-moistened gauze and frozen until use. The bones were placed onto a custom three-point bending apparatus such that primary loading occurs in the posterior to anterior direction. The rate of deformation was established (typically 0.1–0.5 mm s−1), and data recorded with a sampling rate of 100 Hz using MTS Basic Testware (MTS Systems Co., Eden Prairie, MN) with parameters being time, axial force and deflection. These data were imported into Excel for analysis and the maximum force, maximum bending moment, stiffness (the slope of the force-displacement curve), and energy to maximum force (area under the force–displacement curve from the point of contact to the point of maximum force) were calculated.Collection of serumWhole blood was collected into 1.5 ml tubes at the time of killing by cardiac puncture with a 26 gauge needle. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 min. Serum was collected into 1.5 ml tubes and stored at −20°C.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayA sandwich-type EIA Rat Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Nojihigashi, Japan; cat. no. MK147) was used according to manufacturer instructions to measure osteocalcin in serum from osteocalcin-null and wild-type male rats.Statistical analysesOutcomes were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) by two-tailed parametric unpaired t-tests with a 95% confidence level or a s.e.m., or as the area under the curve, with one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA as appropriate. P≤0.05 was considered significant. Outliers were determined by Grubb's outlier test (a=0.05) and excluded from analyses.", "Genotyping procedure": "Genotyping procedureThe following PCR primer sets were used to identify the indel alleles found in F0, F1 and F2 animals: Rnbglap-genF1, 5′-GGCTCAGGCAGTGGATATAAA-3′ and Rnbglap-genR1, 5′-CACAACTCCTCCCTACCAATATG-3′ (601 bp); Rnbglap-genF2, 5′-AAGTCCCACACAGCAACTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genR2, 5′-CGGAGTCTATTCACCACCTTAC-3′ (474 bp); and Rnbglap-genR3, 5′-CTCTCTGGTAGTTTGTCCCTTC-3′ and Rnbglap-genF3, 5′-CACAGCATCCTTTGGGTTTG-3 (329 bp)."}, "stats": {"RESULTS": {"chars": 5810, "tokens": 839, "source": "regular"}, "Loss of osteocalcin results in differences in glucose and insulin tolerance": {"chars": 926, "tokens": 128, "source": "regular"}, "MATERIALS AND METHODS": {"chars": 14340, "tokens": 2143, "source": "regular"}, "Genotyping procedure": {"chars": 425, "tokens": 42, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Disease Models & Mechanisms", "year": "2016", "doi": "10.1242/dmm.025247", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Upon incubation with total cDNA from an individual sample, on-chip polymerase elongation is performed, producing exact DNA copies of the gene transcripts with all their individual variations, such as mutations or differential splicing. This polymerase reaction differs markedly from normal PCR. In normal PCR, the primers are present in abundance. Also, there is a reverse primer binding to the newly synthesised DNA. On the microarray, the only primer molecules present are the ones attached to the surface. Each of them gets extended and there is no inverse primer for amplification. Therefore, there cannot be any out-competition of molecules. In case of two isoforms being present, for example, the ratio, by which they are represented eventually, is defined by the ratio, by which the two isoforms are present in the mixture; also their length does not matter (Supplementary Fig. 1). Hybridisation and annealing are controlled by kinetics and mass transport and thus the ratio of abundance1213. Temperature cycling is only done in order to hybridise template also to primers that were not extended during the initial elongation cycle.From these DNA copies, full-length proteins are produced by in situ transcription and translation, which resemble the proteins actually present in the original sample. The immobilised primers used (see Methods for details) encode a T7 promoter and ribosomal binding site (RBS). Additionally, they contain sequences for an N-terminal 6×His and C-terminal V5 tag, which allows an antibody-based detection of the eventual proteins. Apart from gene-specific primers, also oligonucleotides were used that permit the copying of genes from cDNA clones via vector sequences. As the thermostable attachment of the primers to the microarray surface was achieved via a 5′-amino linker, the 3′-end was accessible to DNA polymerase. Addition of a (dT)10 sequence to the 5′-end of the primers yielded better hybridisation efficiency of the cDNA to the surface-bound molecules14. About 7.5 fmol of immobilised primer pairs in spots with a diameter of about 100 μm were optimal for successful amplification. The quality of array-bound DNA-products was examined by hybridisation of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides that were complementary to the two newly synthesised DNA strands (Fig. 1b). Alternatively, primers were added to the immobilised DNA-templates. A polymerase reaction generated single-strand copies that were subsequently eluted from the microarray and amplified in solution. The resulting PCR-products were characterised by electrophoresis (Fig. 1b). From such quality control experiments, it was determined the intra- and inter-array coefficients of variation ranged between 5% and 20% up to a size of some 3 kb. For larger molecules, the yield varied strongly, although the polymerase used was suitable for synthesising long fragments.The microarrays do not represent the proteins equivalent to mRNA abundance. On the contrary, for each protein a very similar amount of protein is present on the array, irrespective of the fact whether the respective mRNA is rare or frequent in the RNA isolate. By virtue of the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction and, independently from it, also due to the subsequent cell-free transcription and translation, the differences are mostly levelled. Consequently, similar amounts of protein will be produced at each microarray position. As a matter of fact, we have shown that usually the loading capacity of the microarray surface is limiting and thus determining the amount of protein present11.Protein qualityIn order to define the efficiency of the in situ transcription and translation process, templates were used that had been produced with common primers from 2016 full-length cDNAs, which were randomly selected by using 21 microtiter plates of a library of in total about 12,000 non-redundant, full-length and sequence-verified clones15. Prokaryotic cell lysate was used for in situ protein expression. Using the MIST approach11, the reaction takes place in a small droplet at each spot. The droplets serve as separate compartments, thereby preventing cross-contamination. The newly expressed proteins are retained at the location of synthesis. As opposed to other approaches, there is no particular process of attachment to the surface, such as a chemical reaction or any means of specific affinity binding79. The proteins stick to the surface by non-covalent interaction with the epoxy-groups at the respective slide locations. In subsequent washing or incubation steps, no loss or movement of the in situ synthesised proteins could be detected. We prefer unspecific immobilisation, since the random orientation makes accessible all sides of a protein.Subsequent to protein expression, the arrays were incubated with fluorescently labelled antibodies that bound all proteins specifically at their N-terminal 6xHis or C-terminal V5 tags, respectively (Fig. 2a,b). From the signal intensities, it can be concluded that more than 90% of the protein spots contained full-length protein. For most proteins, 50% to 90% of the total protein amount was full-length, the actual yield being dependent on protein size (Fig. 2c). Some kind of limit was reached at about 110 kDa, equivalent to a length of the DNA template of about 3 kb. The reason for this is a combination of the restrictions of the initial polymerase reaction and the subsequent transcription and translation process. Nevertheless, some proteins could be expressed to full-length that were substantially larger. Also, the median of the mass of human proteins is about 42 kDa, substantially less than 110 kDa. Therefore, the majority of human proteins could be presented on the microarray.A comparison of the signals generated by known amounts of spotted green fluorescence protein (GFP) with that of in situ synthesized molecules showed that around 0.2 fmol of protein was expressed on the array surface (Fig. 2d). From this experiment, it could also be concluded that only a small portion of the surface capacity is quenched by proteins that are present during the primer elongation reaction and the in situ translation process, which is not surprising given the relatively low protein concentration in the reactions. The capacity of about 0.2 fmol was confirmed by protein-staining with luminescence dye Sypro Ruby of some 14,000 different protein molecules expressed from PCR-products representing the genes of Trypanosoma brucei (Supplementary Fig. 2). The protein expression produced an average intra- and inter-array coefficient of variations of 14.6%, ranging from 7.2% to 21.6%. Also, as expected, most proteins were produced in very similar amounts (Supplementary Fig. 3). On purpose, we selected a few of the proteins that exhibited different yields in order to check reproducibility. Despite their differences in overall protein yield, reproducibility for each protein was nevertheless high. In addition, reproducibility was high both on microarrays produced as part of one production batch as well as on microarrays from different batches that were produced several weeks apart (Supplementary Fig. 4).The fluorescence of GFP also indicated that in situ synthesised protein could fold correctly and be functional. Given the very wide variety of protein size, structure and biochemistry, however, it is difficult to predict how many proteins may fold properly. We have performed a substantial number of incubations with antibodies, including few binders that are meant to identify structural epitopes. We have made the experience that some of the latter could also bind to linear epitopes, however. In experiments about the interaction of different molecule types, including protein-RNA interactions, protein-DNA interactions and protein-protein interactions (Figs 2e–g and 3f), we found many cases, in which proteins exhibited the expected functionality and specificity. However, the data is insufficient and probably also too biased to make from this a serious estimate about the overall percentage of properly folded proteins.Sample analysisIn addition to using oligomer hybridisation and tag-specific antibodies for quality control (Fig. 3a,b), in situ transcript amplification and subsequent protein expression were confirmed with antibodies that target individual proteins. Detection of binding was done with a secondary, fluorescently labelled antibody that was binding to the Fc part of the primary, protein-specific antibodies (Fig. 3c,d). In order to demonstrate the acquisition of personalised information, we studied tumour tissues of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma – a tumour entity whose mortality is close to incidence and the forth most frequent cause of cancer-related death16 – in comparison to samples of matching healthy donors. mRNA preparations from tissues of either healthy donors, patients with chronic pancreatitis or cancer patients as well as a tumour cell line were copied onto microarrays and expressed. Antibodies were utilised that recognise different isoforms of the same protein. They belong to a set of antibodies that were made for identifying cancer-associated variations that are due to differential splicing (unpublished data). Distinct variations were detected between healthy and disease samples in the expression of RUNX1 (Fig. 3e), for example. By sequencing, the relevant splice variance, skipping of exon 6 in the RUNX1 transcript, could be confirmed.", "Methods": "MethodsOligonucleotidesAll oligonucleotides were obtained from biomers.net (Ulm, Germany). Forward and reverse primer pairs were designed to amplify the respective open reading frame in full. Forward primers contained a ribosomal binding site (RBS), optionally a Kozak sequence, a T7 promoter, a 6× His epitope tag sequence, and a transcript-specific portion. Reverse primers were made of the V5 epitope sequence and a transcript-specific sequence; the presence of a T7 terminator sequence was found to be unnecessary. The Kozak sequence, which is important for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, was not added, if prokaryotic cell lysates were used for protein expression. Primers that were attached to solid support had a (dT)10 stretch at their 5′-ends, which acted as a linker. Attachment to the epoxysilane-coated microarray surface occurred via an amino-group, which was chemically added during synthesis to the 5′-end as part of a C6-linker. The fluorescent Cy5- or Cy3-label of oligonucleotides used for hybridisation was added during chemical synthesis. The actual oligonucleotide sequences are provided as Supplementary Materials information.Primer attachmentPrimer oligonucleotides were diluted to a concentration of 5 μM in 150 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.001% Tween 20. A volume of 1.5 nl was placed onto epoxysilane-coated slides (Nexterion E; Schott, Jena, Germany) using a NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-system (Gesim, Großerkmannsdorf, Germany). Printed slides were kept at room temperature and 70% humidity for 24 h and stored dry for a minimum of two days before being used. Prior to the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction, the slides were blocked in superblock buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. The slides were washed three times in distilled water and spin dried in a swing-wing centrifuge.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was extracted from the respective biological material (tumour, chronic pancreatitis and healthy pancreatic tissues as well as the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca-2) using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by absorption measurement on a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany). The RNA was stored at −80 °C or used immediately for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was produced from 1 μg of total RNA by means of the Protoscript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. One tenth of the product was used for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction.On-chip polymerase elongation reactionAn adhesive gene frame (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was fixed onto the microarray and filled with 25 μl of 1x Qiagen LongRange PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 100 ng DNA and 1 U LongRange PCR polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primer extension was done in a 16 × 16 dual-block PTC 200 thermocycler (BioRad, Munich, Germany) by initial heating to 93 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 93 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and a final elongation step at 68 °C for 10 min. The microarrays were extensively washed with water to remove the PCR cocktail and dried using pressurised air.Detection of on-chip DNA-products by oligonucleotide hybridisationFluorescently (Cy3 or Cy5) labelled oligonucleotides were diluted to 1 μM in 3× SSC (450 mM NaCl, 45 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.1% SDS. After 10 min at 95 °C, hybridisation was at 60 °C overnight. The microarrays were subsequently washed in 3× SSC supplemented with 0.1% SDS, then in 3× SSC and finally in 0.3× SSC for 10 min each. The arrays were briefly rinsed with water and dried with pressurised air. The signal intensities were detected on a Power Scanner (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).Detection of on-chip DNA-products by PCR in solutionThe microarrays were extensively washed with water and dried. Adhesive gene frames (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed on the microarrays and filled in with 1x Qiagen PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). However, no DNA template was added but for the DNA present on the microarray spots. The amplification reaction was performed as described for the on-chip polymerase elongation reaction. The PCR-products in the supernatant were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. As a negative control, spots were used on which there was no DNA-template.In situ cell-free protein expressionFor protein expression, slides with PCR-products were washed twice in 1xSSC for 5 min and dried. Multiple spotting (MIST) was used for in situ cell-free expression as described in detail before11. In short, the slides were placed into the NanoPlotter 2.0 non-contact piezo-element system (Gesim) in the same orientation they had been during primer spotting. First, 0.6 nl of 0.5 M betaine was spotted onto the position of each PCR-product, followed by 2.1 nl of S30 T7 High-Yield Protein Expression System (Promega, Madison, USA). In a humidified chamber, the slides were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently at 30 °C overnight. After washing, the microarrays were stored at −20 °C for a minimum of 24 h before use. Usually, we use a density of about 2,000 proteins per slide of 7 × 2 cm. At higher densities, there is a higher risk that the individual droplets, in which the reactions take place, may get in contact, thus causing contamination. However, spot density can be adapted to the respective requirements.Protein detectionSypro Ruby stainingFor a quick determination of overall array quality, protein microarrays were incubated with Sypro Ruby staining solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting luminescence signal is equivalent to the amount of protein present at each location.Antibody detectionFor a more detailed analysis, expressed proteins were detected with directly fluorescence-labelled antibodies that recognise the N-terminal 6xHis epitope (Penta-His Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate; Qiagen) or the C-terminal V5 epitope (monoclonal anti-V5-Cy3; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). In addition, protein-specific monoclonal antibodies were used (e.g., anti-CDK2, clone AN4.3 and anti-P53, clone DO-1; Sigma-Aldrich). The microarrays were blocked with 2% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (137 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 10.0 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.76 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min. Blocking with 2% BSA was required so as to cover the regions in between protein spots, since otherwise the labelled antibodies would bind preferentially to these areas. There was very little unspecific binding to the actual protein spots even without blocking, but the blocking does not harm specific binding events. After washing the arrays surface in PBST three times, antibody incubation was in PBST, 2% BSA at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 1 h. While 0.1 μg/ml binder was used for epitope tag detection, protein-specific antibodies had a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. For detection of the latter, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and incubated with a 1:10.000 dilution of fluorescent dye conjugated secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Cy5-conjugated antibody; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) for another hour. Finally, the microarrays were washed three times in PBST for 10 min and air-dried in a ventilated oven.DARPin targetsTarget proteins were enzymatically biotinylated using the ImmunoProbe Biotinylation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation of 5 μg/ml biotinylated protein on the DARPin array, detection was performed with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-Etravidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h.Data acquisition and analysisFor signal detection, microarrays were scanned on a Power Scanner (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). In all measurements, the instrument’s laser power and photomultiplier tube were adjusted to avoid signal saturation. The scanner settings were kept identical for all arrays of an experimental series. Relevant parameters, such as concordance of the two colour detection channels, were carefully validated throughout. Spot segmentation was performed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Union City, USA). The mean local background intensity was subtracted from the mean signal intensity for each spot to obtain background-corrected signal intensities.

Quality control of amplified RNA and purity of dissected cell populations were as described previously32. All LN chains were expressed in both LEPC and BCEC populations except LN-γ3 (LAMC3). Expression levels of LN-α2 (LAMA2: 3.1 ± 0.6-fold; p = 0.02), LN-α4 (LAMA4: 98.3 ± 50.0-fold; p = 0.02), LN-α5 (LAMA5: 7.2 ± 4.6-fold; p = 0.01), LN-β2 (LAMB2: 3.0 ± 0.4-fold; p = 0.04), LN-β3 (LAMB3: 3.0 ± 0.8-fold; p = 0.02) and LN-γ2 (LAMC2: 3.0 ± 0.8-fold; p = 0.04) were significantly higher in LEPC compared with BCEC, whereas no differential expression patterns were observed for LN-α1 (LAMA1), -α3 (LAMA3), -β1 (LAMB1), -β4 (LAMB4), and -γ1 (LAMC1) (Fig. 1A). Of note, corneal epithelial expression levels of LN-α4 and –α5 were hardly above the detection threshold.By immunohistochemistry using chain-specific antibodies (Table 1; n = 10), the LN-α2, -α3, -α5, -ß1, -ß2, -ß3, -γ1, and -γ2 chains were shown to be strongly expressed in the limbal BM, whereas LN-α1 and -γ3 chains were only weakly expressed (Fig. 1B). The LN-α4 chain was not detected in epithelial but only in vascular basement membranes (Fig. 1B). Antibodies against LN-ß4 were not available. The most pronounced differential expression patterns between limbal and corneal regions were observed for LN-α2, -α5, -ß2, and -γ3 chains, which could be hardly detected in the corneal BM (Fig. 1B).Concurrent with the qPCR data, the immunohistochemical findings suggest that the human limbal niche is specifically enriched for LN-α2 and -α5 chains.These were found to co-localize with the progenitor cell markers cytokeratin (CK)15, N-cadherin, and p63α as well as with integrins α3, α6 and ß1 expressed by LEPC clusters in the basal epithelium at the limbus (data for LN-α5 is shown in Fig. 1C).Expression of laminin chains in limbal stem/progenitor and associated niche cells in vitroTo determine the relative contribution of LEPC and their associated stromal niche cells to expression of LN chains in the limbal niche, we established cultures of both LEPC and limbal mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSC) from collagenase-digested LEPC clusters (n = 5) as described previously (Fig. 2A)32. To verify the purity of cell populations, we analyzed the expression profiles of established corneal epithelial (progenitor) markers, such as cytokeratin 3 (KRT3) and 15 (KRT15) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), as well as mesenchymal (stem cell) markers, such as intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), sex determining region Y –box 2 (SOX2), and stem cell factor receptor (KIT) by qPCR primer assays (n = 5). As expected, LEPC populations showed significantly higher expression levels of KRT3 (10.3 ± 6.3-fold), KRT15 (5.6 ± 2.1-fold) and CEACAM (11.6 ± 4.5-fold), while LMSC populations showed higher expression levels of ICAM1 (5.4 ± 2.9-fold), SOX2 (5.0 ± 2.1-fold) and KIT (19.6 ± 10.2-fold) (p = 0.02) (Fig. 2B). LMSC were further characterized by flow cytometry (n = 3) with more than 90% of the cells expressing the mesenchymal stem cell markers CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD44 (Fig. 2C).Differential gene expression analyses (n = 5) showed that LN-α3 (27.1 ± 17.3-fold; p = 0.02), -α5 (15.6 ± 10.4-fold; p = 0.02), -β3 (32.1 ± 27.3-fold; p = 0.02), and -γ2 (23.4 ± 11.9-fold; p = 0.03) chains were predominantly expressed in the LEPC population compared to LMSC, whereas LN-α2 (5.2 ± 2.6-fold; p = 0.02), -α4 (30.9 ± 21.5-fold; p = 0.02), -β2 (4.4 ± 0.8-fold; n.s.), -γ1 (2.7 ± 0.6-fold; p = 0.02), and -γ3 (8.4 ± 1.5-fold; p = 0.02) chains were predominantly expressed in LMSC compared to LEPC (Fig. 2D).Together, these expression data obtained in vivo and in vitro suggest that LN-α5 constitutes a signature BM component of the limbal niche, which is endogenously produced by LEPC and becomes strongly enriched in the BM of the limbal niche.Effect of laminin isoforms on LEPC adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiationThe cell-binding activities of LN isoforms are largely determined by α chains27, 43. As the availability of purified LN isoforms is limited, we performed in vitro tests of LEPC function using the two main LN-α5 chain containing isoforms, i.e. recombinant LN-511 and -521, as substrates, compared to isoforms containing LN-α1, -α2, -α3 or -α4 chains, i.e. recombinant LN-111, -211, -332, -411, and -421. Recombinant LN-511-E8 fragment which carries only C-terminal domains, where the main β1-integrin binding sites occur41, was tested in addition.The effect of the different LNs on cell adhesion was evaluated by determining the number of adherent LEPC on LN-coated (1.0 µg/cm2) culture wells at 30 and 60 min after seeding compared to uncoated tissue culture plates (n = 4). Coating with LN-521, LN-511, LN-511-E8 and LN-332 increased cell adhesion significantly over the uncoated control both after 30 and 60 min of incubation (Fig. 3A). Differences were significant (p = 0.02) for LN-521 (2.6-fold at 30 min and 1.9-fold at 60 min), LN-511 (2.0- and 1.5-fold), LN-511-E8 (2.5- and 1.6-fold) and LN-332 (2.1- and 1.4-fold). LN-421, LN-411, LN-221, and LN-111 did not support adhesion better than uncoated tissue culture plastic. Phase contrast microscopy showed a dense monolayer of epithelial cells on LN-521, -511, and 511-E8, but rather sparser layers on the other LN isoforms 24 hours after seeding (Fig. 3B).LN-511/521 has been reported to bind to integrin α3β1 and α6β1, while LN-332 binds to integrin α6β4 on the cell membrane44. Because integrins α3β1and α6β4 have been previously reported to mediate anchorage of LEPC to their niche32, we analyzed the expression of these integrin subunits on the cell surface of cultured LEPC (n = 3) and evaluated the effect of integrin blocking on LEPC adhesion to LN-521, -511, -511-E8 and -332 (n = 4). As demonstrated by flow cytometry, almost 100% of LEPC expressed α3, α6, β1 and β4 integrins on their surface (Fig. 3C) and both neutralizing antibodies against α3β1 and α6β1 integrins significantly reduced adhesion of LEPC to LN-521 (α6β1: 39.1% (−1.6-fold); α3β1: 54.0% (−2.2-fold)), LN-511 (α6β1: 42.6% (−1.7-fold); α3β1: 52.5% (−2.1-fold)), LN-511-E8 (α6β1: 25.7% (−1.3-fold; α3β1: 20.4% (−1.2-fold)), and LN-332 (α6β1: 28.2% (−1.4-fold); α3β1: 32.2%(−1.5-fold)) as early as 1 hour after seeding (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that LN-α5 and –α3 mediate LEPC adhesion through integrins α3β1 and α6β1 integrin binding.To evaluate the effect of LN isoforms on LEPC migration, cells were plated on the different LN isoforms and gap closure following removal of a culture insert was analyzed 3 and 6 hours afterwards (n = 3). All LN isoforms, except LN-211 and LN-411, induced a significant increase in cell migration compared to uncoated controls at both time points (LN-521: 2.1- and 1.5-fold; LN-511: 1.7- and 1.4-fold; LN-511-E8: 2.5- and 1.6-fold; LN-421: 2.9- and 1.6-fold; LN-332: 1.8- and 1.4-fold; LN-111: 2.3- and 1.5-fold) (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3E).The effect of LN isoforms on cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation assay 48 and 72 hours after seeding of LEPC on LN-coated culture wells (n = 5). Compared with uncoated controls, proliferation rates were significantly increased only in LEPC plated on LN-521 (1.7- and 1.4-fold), LN-511 (1.5- and 1.4-fold), and LN-511-E8 (1.5- and 1.4-fold) and were reduced in cells plated on LN-332 (−1.4- and −1.6-fold) (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4A). These findings were confirmed by cell counting (n = 3; p = 0.02) (Fig. 4B) and immunocytochemical staining for the proliferation marker Ki-67 (n = 3), which showed an increased percentage of positive cells on LN-521 (41.7 ± 2.5%; 1.4-fold; p = 0.001), LN-511 (36.4 ± 3.6%; 1.2-fold; p = 0.004), and LN-511-E8 (41.5 ± 2.5%; 1.4-fold; p = 0.009) but a decreased percentage of positive cells on LN-332 (16.7 ± 3.1%; −1.8-fold; p = 0.0007) compared to uncoated control (28.7 ± 2.8%) (Fig. 4C, right). Accordingly, mRNA expression levels of Ki-67 were also increased in LEPC cultured on LN-521 (2.6 ± 0.3-fold), LN-511 (3.1 ± 0.4-fold), and LN-511-E8 (2.8 ± 0.3-fold) and decreased in LEPC cultured in LN-332 (−4.1 ± 0.4-fold) compared to control (n = 5; p = 0.02) (Fig. 4C, left).To assess a potential effect of LN isoforms on the differentiation state of LEPC, mRNA expression levels of KRT3, a cornea-specific differentiation marker, and KRT15, an established progenitor cell marker, were analyzed by qRT-PCR in LEPC passages 1 to 3 (n = 5). Although there was a trend towards suppression of KRT3 expression in LEPC cultivated on LN-521, -511, -511-E8, and -421 compared to control (Fig. 4D), differences were not statistically significant. Expression levels of KRT15 were also not significantly different from controls, except for LN-332, which supported maintenance of high KRT15 expression levels for up to 3 passages (p = 0.02).These observations suggest that LN-332 supports an undifferentiated phenotype but inhibits proliferation, whereas LN-521, -511, and 511-E8 support cell proliferation without affecting differentiation, rendering LN-α5 containing isoforms as suitable candidates for tissue engineering purposes.Tissue engineering of corneal epithelial constructsSince recombinant LN-E8 fragments have been shown to promote efficient and scalable culture of human stem cells under defined xeno-free conditions41, 45, we tested the applicability of LN-511-E8 for tissue engineering of corneal epithelial constructs (n = 5). To generate multilayered epithelial cell sheets on 3D-scaffolds suitable for clinical application, LEPC were seeded and cultivated for 12 to 14 days on fibrin gels prepared with or without incorporation of LN-511-E8 (10 µg/ml). LEPC expansion was markedly increased on LN-containing gels compared with untreated gels resulting in a confluent monolayer on LN-511-E8 by 5 days after seeding (Fig. 5A). Light microscopic analyses of tissue constructs showed a stratified epithelial cell sheet consisting of a cuboidal basal layer and 5 to 6 layers of flattened suprabasal cells on LN-511-E8 containing gels, but only 3 to 4 cell layers on LN-free gels (Fig. 5B). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed formation of well-organized multi-layered epithelial cell sheets consisting of a basal layer of cuboid cells covered by several layers of flattened elongated cells (Fig. 5C,i). Suprabasal cells showed typical ultrastructural signs of epithelial differentiation, such as desmosomes, cytoplasmic filaments, and apical microvilli. Basal cells appeared to be firmly attached to the LN-511-E8 containing fibrin gels by formation of hemidesmosomes and newly produced BM, whereas they appeared to only loosely adhere to LN-free fibrin gels where no BM deposition was evident (Fig. 5C,ii).Immunofluorescence analysis of epithelial constructs showed expression of corneal epithelial differentiation marker CK3 in superficial layers and expression of progenitor cell markers CK15 and p63α in (supra)basal layers (Fig. 5D). The cell-matrix receptors α3, α6 and ß1 integrin could be mainly immunolocalized to the basal aspects of epithelial sheets, which also provided evidence of endogenous expression of LN-α5 and -α3. Protein expression was found to be generally more pronounced in epithelial constructs established on LN-511-E8 containing gels than on pure fibrin gels. These data suggest that LN-511-E8-coated fibrin gels promote ex vivo-expansion of LEPC and the generation of a stratified, firmly adherent, corneal epithelial-like cell sheet containing both differentiated and undifferentiated cells, which appears amenable for transplantation onto the corneal surface.", "Methods": "MethodsHuman tissues and study approvalHuman donor corneas (n = 5 for LCM, n = 10 for immunohistochemistry) not suitable for transplantation with appropriate research consent were procured by the Erlangen Cornea Bank. In addition, organ-cultured corneoscleral tissue (n = 42) with appropriate research consent was provided by the Erlangen Cornea Bank after corneal endothelial transplantation. Informed consent to corneal tissue donation was obtained from the donors or their relatives. Experiments using human tissue samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical Faculty of the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (No. 4218-CH) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.Laser capture microdissection (LCM) and amplification of RNALCM and amplification of RNA was performed as previously described32. Briefly, corneal specimens destined for LCM were obtained from five donors (mean age, 69.6 ± 10.4 years) within 15 hours after death. After labeling of the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants of donor globes, tissue sectors were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek Europe) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial cryosections of 12 μm thickness were obtained under RNAse-free conditions from the superior or inferior quadrants, placed onto UV-irradiated (3000 mJ/cm2) PEN (polyethylene naphtalate) Membrane Slides (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Göttingen, Germany), and stained with 0.01% cresyl violet. The PALM MicroBeam IV system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) was used to isolate clusters of basal limbal epithelial cells (LEPC) and basal epithelial cells from central cornea (BCEC). From each donor eye, 100 cryosections were dissected (50 from the superior and 50 from the inferior quadrants, respectively) yielding a total of 500 cryosections used for sample collection.RNA isolation from these specimens was achieved using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including an on-column DNase digestion step according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control was performed on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples with an RNA concentration of 650–2,000 pg/µl and a RIN (RNA integrity number) of ≥7.0 were used for further analysis. Following RNA-amplification using the MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, aRNA (amplified RNA) concentration was measured on a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and quality control was again performed using Agilent technology.Real time RT-PCRFirst-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 5 µg of aRNA from tissue samples or RNA from cultured cells and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) as previously described32. PCR reactions were run in triplicate in 1× TaqMan Probe Mastermix (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) or 1× SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, München, Germany), respectively, according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Primer sequences (Eurofins, Anzing, Germany) are given in Table 2. For normalization of gene expression levels, ratios relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH were calculated by the comparative C T method (ΔΔC T). Genes were considered as differentially expressed when their expression levels exceeded a two-fold difference in all specimens analyzed.Immunohisto- and immunocytochemistryCorneoscleral tissue samples obtained from 10 normal human donor eyes (mean age, 72.3 ± 11.6 years) and 3D-cultures were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and frozen in isopentane-cooled liquid nitrogen. Cryosections of 4 μm thickness were cut from the superior or inferior quadrants, fixed in cold acetone for 10 minutes, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and incubated in primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Antibody binding was detected by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and nuclear counterstaining was performed with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). Immunolabelled cryosections and cultured LEPC were examined with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) or a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss Microscopy). In negative control experiments, the primary antibodies were replaced by PBS or equimolar concentrations of an irrelevant isotypic primary antibody.Cell cultureLEPC clusters were isolated from 42 corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 69.2 ± 7.1 years) as previously described32. Briefly, organ-cultured corneoscleral tissue with appropriate research consent was provided by the Erlangen Cornea Bank after corneal endothelial transplantation. After rinsing in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, the tissues were cut into 12 one-clock-hour sectors, from which limbal segments were obtained by incisions made at 1 mm before and beyond the anatomical limbus. Each limbal segment was enzymatically digested with 2 mg/mL collagenase A at 37 °C for 18 hours to generate epithelial-mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell clusters. Cell clusters were isolated from single cells by using reversible cell strainers with a pore size of 37 µm (Stem Cell Technologies, Köln, Germany). Isolated cell clusters were further dissociated into single cells by digestion with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37 °C for 10–15 min. Single cell suspensions were seeded into T75 flasks (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) in Keratinocyte serum free medium (KSFM) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies) and 1× penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B mix (Pan Biotech) to enrich epithelial cell population (LEPC) and the flasks were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. To enrich the associated mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSC), single cell suspensions were seeded into T75 flasks in Mesencult media (Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The media was changed every second day. Cultivated cells were used for real time PCR (n = 10), flow cytometry (n = 3), functional assays (adhesion: n = 4, integrin blocking: n = 4, migration: n = 3, proliferation: n = 13) and tissue engineering (n = 5).Flow cytometryLEPC cluster derived and enriched mesenchymal cells (LMSC, P1) were isolated from 3 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 66.5 ± 4.6 years) and characterized by flow cytometry using anti-CD90, -CD73, -CD105, -CD44, -CD34, -CD45, -CD31 and isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). LEPC were characterized using anti-α3 integrin-APC, anti-α6 integrin-APC, anti-β1 integrin-FITC and anti-β4 integrin-eFluor660 antibodies (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany). Single cell suspensions (0.5–1 × 106 cells) were incubated with saturating concentrations of respective primary antibodies or conjugated antibodies in 100 µl PBS, 0.1% sodium azide and 2% fetal calf serum for 40 min. After three washes, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Primary antibody reactions were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Cells were then washed and re-suspended in ice-cold PBS. After addition of 5 µl of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) to exclude dead cells, cytometry was performed on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) by using FACS Diva Software. A total of 10,000 events were acquired to determine the positivity of cell surface markers.Cell adhesion assayLEPC isolated from 4 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 74.2 ± 5.8 years) were seeded onto 96 well-plates coated with recombinant LN-111, -211, -332, -411, -421, -511, -521 (1.0 µg/cm2; BioLamina, Sundbyberg, Sweden) and recombinant LN-511-E8 (0.5 µg/cm2; Nippi, Tokyo, Japan) as per manufacturers’ recommendations. Coating solutions were prepared in 1x DPBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline) with calcium and magnesium and incubated in culture wells either for two hours at 37 °C (fast coating) or overnight at 4 °C (slow coating) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (P1-P2) were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 and left to adhere for 30 and 60 min at 37 °C. Standard tissue culture treated plates were used as control. After incubation, plates were washed with DPBS using a Static Cell Adhesion Wash Chamber (Glycotec, Maryland, USA) to remove non-adherent cells, and the adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. After three washes with water, stained cells were extracted with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and quantified by measuring optical density (OD) at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). All experiments (n = 4) were performed in quadruplicates. The fold change values were calculated as OD of the LN/OD of control.The effect of an interaction between cellular integrins and extracellular LNs on cell adhesion was evaluated by seeding LEPC (50,000 cells/cm2) in 96-well plates coated with recombinant LN-332, -511, -521, and LN-511-E8 in the presence or absence of integrin-neutralizing antibodies, i.e., anti-α3 integrin (20 µg/ml) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-α6 integrin (20 µg/ml) (Merck Millipore) and anti-β1 integrin (2.5 µg/ml) (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). 60 minutes after seeding, the numbers of adherent cells were determined as described above. LEPC used for integrin blocking assays were isolated from 4 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 67.7 ± 6.1 years) and all experiments were performed in quadruplicates.Cell migration assayTo exactly measure the change in the cell-covered area over time, 2 well-culture inserts with a defined cell-free gap were used (ibidi GmbH, Planegg, Germany). Briefly, the wells were coated with LN isoforms as described above and seeded with 70 µl of a LEPC suspension containing 5 × 105 cells/ml. LEPC were isolated from 3 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 71.3 ± 6.1 years). After formation of a cellular monolayer (24 hours), the silicone inserts were removed and the culture medium was supplemented with 2.5 µg/ml of soluble LNs. Images of each well were acquired immediately following insert removal (0 hours) and after 3 and 6 hours by using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus). Image analysis software Cell F (Olympus) was used to measure areas that were free of migrating cells. All experiments (n = 3) were performed in triplicates.Cell proliferation assaysLEPC used for cell proliferation assays were isolated from a total of 13 corneoscleral buttons after corneal endothelial transplantation (mean age, 70.0 ± 8.0 years).The effect of LNs on LEPC proliferation was quantified using the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Colorimetric Assay Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells (P1-P2) were seeded into 96-well plates, coated with LN isoforms as described above, at a density of 5000 cells/well, cultured for 48 and 72 hours, and labeled with BrdU according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum), and fold change values were calculated as described above. Experiments (n = 5) were performed in quadruplicates.For immunocytochemical analysis of cell proliferation, LEPC (n = 3) were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well into 4 well- glass chamber slides (LabTek; Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany), cultured for 72 hours, and stained with antibodies against Ki-67 (Abcam; Cambridge, UK). Ki-67 positive cells were counted in the 4 wells using CellF image analysis software (Olympus). Ki-67 expression was also analyzed by real time PCR as described above (n = 5).In addition, cell numbers were counted after trypsinization of LEPC 7 days after seeding (5 × 104 cells/well) in 6-well culture plates using CASY technology (Schärfe System GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) (n = 3).Tissue engineering of epithelial constructsScaffolds for tissue engineering and 3D-cell culture were prepared from fibrin as previously described38. Briefly, the gels were prepared by dissolving fibrinogen and thrombin stock solutions (Tisseel; Baxter Deutschland GmbH, Unterschleißheim, Germany) in 1.1% NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml fibrinogen and 3 IU/ml thrombin. Recombinant LN-511-E8 (10 µg/ml) was incorporated into the gels, which were placed into 24 well-culture inserts and allowed to polymerize at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, gels were additionally coated with LN-511-E8 (5 µg/ml) overnight. LN-511-E8 free gels served as controls. LEPC (P1) were isolated from 5 organ-cultured corneoscleral buttons (mean age, 65.0 ± 7.5 years) and seeded onto coated and uncoated control gels at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultivated in KSFM media under low calcium concentrations (0.09 mM Ca2+) for 5 to 6 days. Culture conditions were switched to DMEM/Ham’s F12 (Hyclone; GE Health Care Life Sciences, Freiburg, Germany) supplemented with Human Corneal Growth Supplement (Life Technologies), 10% FCS (GE Health Care Life Sciences), and high calcium concentrations (1.2 mM Ca2+) in order to promote cell differentiation. After another 6 to 8 days of cultivation, gels were fixed for immunohistochemistry as described above and for light and electron microscopy.For light and electron microscopy, gels were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin or epoxy resin, respectively, according to standard protocols. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate and examined with an electron microscope (EM 906E; Carl Zeiss Microscopy).Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad InStat statistical package for Windows (Version 5.04; Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean from individual experiments. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess statistical significance.

This sensitivity is specific to glycolysis-related metabolites: the paqr-2 mutant is not more sensitive to other types of stressors such as osmotic or oxidative stress (paraquat), inhibition of the respiratory chain or mevalonate pathway, or toxic doses of DMSO (S1 Fig). The glucose-related stressors, like glucose itself, also cause rigidification of membranes in the paqr-2 mutant (Fig 2).The E. coli diet is responsible for metabolite toxicityOthers have shown that glucose shortens the lifespan of C. elegans by acting directly on the worms [13,14]. We were therefore surprised to discover that glucose is not toxic to paqr-2 mutants grown on an E. coli strain carrying a ΔPTS mutation that prevents glucose uptake (Fig 3A). This mutation specifically abolishes glucose toxicity, and has no effect on glycerol or pyruvate toxicity (S2A Fig). To better understand the role of the bacteria in mediating metabolite toxicity, we took advantage of the Keio collection of E. coli deletion mutants [15]. This collection is derived from the BW25113 E. coli strain, a food source that does not attenuate the cold sensitivity or tail tip defects of the paqr-2 mutant grown on NGM plates (S2B and S2C Fig). Of five metabolites tested (glucose, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, lactate and pyruvate) that are toxic to the paqr-2 mutant grown on a standard diet of OP50 E. coli, only two (glucose and glycerol) are toxic to paqr-2 mutants grown on a diet of BW25113 (S2D Fig). Additionally, mutations in several E. coli genes important for the metabolism of glucose or glycerol abrogated the toxicity of these dietary supplements on paqr-2 mutants fed BW25113 (Fig 3B–3D; S3 Fig). E. coli metabolism is therefore responsible for the toxicity of several dietary metabolites in the paqr-2 mutant. Conversely, a normal function of PAQR-2 must be to protect against such dietary toxicity.PAQR-2 prevents the lipotoxicity of diets with high SFA/MUFA ratiosThe metabolites toxic to paqr-2 mutants can all be readily converted into acetyl-CoA, a precursor for fatty acid synthesis (Fig 3B). To better understand the nature of the dietary toxicity, we analyzed the fatty acid composition of E. coli grown with different supplements or mutations. We found that dietary E. coli containing elevated SFA/MUFA ratios are toxic to the paqr-2 mutant (Fig 4A; complete lipidomics values are provided as a separate supplementary dataset file). Specifically, a dietary SFA/MUFA ratio higher than ~1.8 results in an excess SFA in the worm phospholipids that is almost always lethal to paqr-2 mutants (Fig 4A and 4B and S4A Fig). Interestingly, evaluating the simpler palmitic acid (PA; 16:0)/cis-vaccenic acid (CVC; 18:1 delta 11) ratio was equally predictive of lethality (Fig 4A). The only exception was the pfkA E. coli mutant grown on glucose that supported the growth of paqr-2 mutant worms in spite of an elevated PA/CVC ratio (S4A Fig); this pfkA E. coli mutant had a very unusual glossy appearance indicative of complex metabolic reprogramming (see Fig 3C).To test directly the effect of SFAs, we developed a protocol to pre-load E. coli with the SFA PA (Fig 5A), resulting in a doubling of dietary PA content (Fig 5B). Using this method, we found that ≥1 mM PA during the cultivation of the E. coli produces a diet that is extremely toxic to the paqr-2 mutant but harmless to wild-type worms (Fig 5C). This toxicity is accompanied by an increase in PA among phospholipids in the worms that is more pronounced in paqr-2 mutants (Fig 5D), and confers a dramatic decrease in membrane fluidity in the paqr-2 mutant (Fig 5E and 5F). Consistently, wild-type worms respond to PA-loaded E. coli by strongly upregulating a GFP-reporter of the Δ9-desaturase FAT-7, which the paqr-2 mutant fails to do (S5 Fig). paqr-2 is therefore required for the upregulation of desaturases that prevent membrane rigidification by dietary SFAs. Importantly, preloading the bacterial diet with a combination of PA and oleic acid (OA; 18:1 delta 9), and thus re-setting the 16:0/18:1 ratio (S4B Fig), greatly reduces toxicity and rigidification of the membrane in paqr-2 mutants (Fig 5G–5I).Mammalian AdipoR2 counters membrane rigidification by exogenous SFAsOthers have shown that the addition of PA to mammalian cells causes membrane rigidification [16–18]. We were able to verify this in human HEK293 cells using the FRAP assay, and also found that the inclusion of OA counters the rigidifying effects of PA (Fig 6A and 6B and Table 1). To test whether the AdipoRs provide protection against the rigidifying effects of PA, we optimized conditions to knockdown the levels of the AdipoRs and other genes using siRNA (Fig 6C). AdipoR2 knockdown (but not AdipoR1 knockdown) caused a clear disorganization of the cellular appearance when HEK293 cells are treated with PA, suggesting a toxic effect (Fig 6D–6G and S6A–S6D Fig). Inhibition of AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 using two independent sets of siRNA oligonucleotides had no effects on the membrane fluidity of HEK293 cells grown under normal conditions (Fig 6H and 6I; S6E and S6F Fig). In contrast, AdipoR2 knockdown (but again not AdipoR1 knockdown) caused a dramatic increase in membrane rigidification of PA-treated HEK293 cells (Fig 6J and 6K; S6G and S6H Fig). As controls, inhibition of the non-essential gene GAPDH had no effect on membrane fluidity, while inhibition of SCD, encoding a stearyl-CoA desaturase, caused the expected reduction of membrane fluidity when HEK293 cells are challenged with PA (S6I and S6L Fig). Additionally, FCCP, an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, did not affect membrane fluidity; this demonstrates that toxicity in itself is not sufficient to lower membrane fluidity (Table 1), as others have also shown [19]. To summarize, among all our FRAP experiments only AdipoR2 and SCD knockdown enhanced the rigidifying effects of PA (Table 1).As mentioned earlier, lipidomics analysis in C. elegans revealed that PAQR-2 is essential to keep phospholipid SFAs below a critical threshold when the worms are fed a SFA-rich diet. We found that a similar phenomenon occurs in HEK293 cells: there is a dramatic increase in the SFA content among PCs, PEs and TAGs when HEK293 cells are incubated in the presence of PA, and this effect is exacerbated when AdipoR2 is knocked-down using siRNA (Fig 6L–6N). Note that AdipoR2 siRNA causes an increased SFA content in PCs, PEs and TAGs even when PA is not added but that the effect is then more modest. Given the proposed ceramidase activity of AdipoR2 [3,8], we also examined the levels of ceramides in our experiments. PA is a precursor for the synthesis of ceramides and we were therefore not surprised that their relative levels were increased in PA-treated cells (Fig 6O). However, the ceramide levels in PA-treated cells did not increase as much when AdipoR2 had been knocked-down by siRNA, which is somewhat surprising if AdipoR2 acts as a ceramidase (Fig 6O).Up to this point, our experiments using PA employed concentrations of 400 μM, which is the concentration at which a detectable rigidifying effect occurs on normal cells. However, we reasoned that if AdipoR2 acts by preventing membrane rigidification, then cells where AdipoR2 has been knocked-down using siRNA should be sensitive to lower amounts of PA. This is indeed the case: 200 μM PA causes a dramatic decrease in membrane fluidity in AdipoR2 siRNA-treated cells but not in control cells (Fig 6P and 6Q), and this rigidification is accompanied by an equally dramatic increase in the SFA content in both PCs and PEs (Fig 6R and 6S). Altogether, these results demonstrate that AdipoR2, like its C. elegans homolog PAQR-2, is required to prevent membrane rigidification by exogenous SFAs.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsC. elegans strains and cultivationThe wild-type C. elegans reference strain N2 and the mutant alleles studied are available from the C. elegans Genetics Center (CGC; MN; USA). The pfat-7::GFP (rtIs30) carrying strain HA1842 was a kind gift from Amy Walker [31], and its quantification was performed as previously described [10]. C. elegans strains maintenance and experiments were performed at 20°C using the E. coli strain OP50 as food source, which was maintained on LB plates kept at 4°C (re-streaked every 6–8 weeks) and single colonies were picked for overnight cultivation at 37°C in LB medium then used to seed NGM plates [56]; new LB plates were streaked every 3–4 months from OP50 stocks kept frozen at -80°C.Plates with supplementsStock solutions of supplements (1M glucose, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and lactate; 5 M NaCl and KCl; 50 mM fluvastatin) were filter sterilized then added to cooled NGM after autoclaving; 100 mM paraquat, 30 mM FCCP (in ethanol), pure DMSO and pure glycerol were used without sterilization.Seeding of NGM plates with E. coli mutantsThe Keio collection of E. coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockouts was used as source of E. coli mutants and kept in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin [15]. Mutants were picked as single colonies from LB plates and cultivated overnight at 37°C in LB then seeded onto NGM plates with or without additives. All mutants were confirmed by PCR.MacConkey agar assayE. coli strains were streaked onto MacConkey agar plates with 0.4% glucose, grown at 37°C over night and scored for colony color.Growth and tail tip scoring assaysFor length measurement studies, synchronized L1s were plated onto test plates seeded with E. coli, and worms were mounted then photographed 96 hour (oleic acid rescue experiments) or 72 hours (all other experiments) later. The length of >20 worms was measured using ImageJ [57]. Quantification of the withered tail tip phenotype was done on synchronous 1-day old adult populations, i.e. 72 h post L1 (n≥100) [10].Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)FRAP experiments in C. elegans were carried out using a membrane-associated prenylated GFP reporter expressed in intestinal cells, as previously described and using a Zeiss LSM700inv laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion objective [11,58]. Briefly, the GFP-positive membranes were photobleached over a circular (7 pixel radius) using 20 iterations of the 488 nm laser with 50% laser power transmission. Images were collected at a 12-bit intensity resolution over 256x256 pixels (digital zoom 4X) using a pixel dwell time of 1.58 μsec, and were all acquired under identical settings. For FRAP in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were stained with BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 (4,4-Difluoro-5-Methyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3-Dodecanoic Acid) (Invitrogen) at 2 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min at 37°C. FRAP images were acquired with an LSM880 confocal microscope equipped with a live cell chamber (set at 37°C and 5% CO2) and ZEN software (Zeiss) with a 40X water immersion objective. Cells were excited with a 488 nm laser and the emission between 493 and 589 nm recorded. Images were acquired with 16 bits image depth and 256x256 resolution using a pixel dwell of ~ 1.34 μs. Ten pre-bleaching images were collected and then the region of interest was beached with 50% of laser power. The recovery of fluorescence was traced for 25 seconds. Fluorescence recovery and Thalf were calculated as previously described [11].Pre-loading of E. coli with fatty acidsStocks of 0.1 M palmitic acid or 0.5 M oleic acid dissolved in ethanol were diluted in LB media to final concentrations of 0.25–2 mM, inoculated with OP50 bacteria, then shaken overnight at 37°C. The bacteria were then washed twice with M9 to remove fatty acids and growth media, diluted to equal OD600, concentrated 10X by centrifugation, dissolved in M9 and seeded onto NGM plates lacking peptone (200μl/plate). Worms were added the following day.LipidomicsFor worm lipidomics, samples were composed of synchronized L4 larvae (one 9 cm diameter plate/sample) grown overnight on OP50-seeded NGM, NGM containing 20mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate, or plates lacking peptone but seeded with fatty acid-supplemented bacteria. Worms were washed 3 times with M9, pelleted and stored at -80°C until analysis. For bacterial lipidomics, E. coli liquid cultures grown overnight at 37°C were seeded on NGM, NGM containing 20 mM glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 20 mM pyruvate or concentrated (as described above) and seeded on plates lacking peptone for lipid-supplemented cultures, kept upside-down at 20°C then washed off 96 h later using pure water, pelleted then frozen at -80°C until analysis. For HEK293 lipidomics, cells were cultivated in serum-free media with or without fatty acids for 24 h prior to harvesting using TrypLE Express (Gibco). For lipid extraction, the pellet was sonicated for 10 minutes in methanol and then extracted according to published methods [59]. Internal standards were added during the extraction. Lipid extracts were evaporated and reconstituted in chloroform:methanol [1:2] with 5 mM ammonium acetate. This solution was infused directly (shotgun approach) into a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrophotometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a Nanomate Triversa (Advion Bioscience, Ithaca, NY) as described previously [60]. Phospholipids were measured using multiple precursor ion scanning [61,62]. Ceramides from HEK293 cells were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry according to previous publication [63]. The data was evaluated using the LipidView software (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The complete lipidomics dataset is provided in the supplementary S1 File.Cultivation of HEK293HEK293 were grown in DMEM containing glucose 1 g/l, pyruvate and GlutaMAX and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, HEPES 10 mM and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) at 37°C in a water humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were sub-cultured twice a week at 90% confluence. Cells were cultivated on treated plastic flask and multi-dish plates (Nunc). For FRAP experiments, HEK293 were seeded in glass bottom dishes (Ibidi) pre-coated with 0.1% porcine gelatin (Sigma).siRNA in HEK293 cellsThe following pre-designed siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon: AdipoR1 J-007800-10-005 (set 1) and J-007800-09-0002 (set 2), AdipoR2 J-007801-10-0005 (set 1) and J-007801-09-0002 (set 2), GAPDH D-001830-10-05, Non-target D-001810-01-05 or D-001810-10-05, and SCD J-005061-07-0005. Transfection of 25 nM siRNA was performed in complete media using Viromer Blue according to the manufacturer’s instructions 1X (Lipocalyx). Knockdown gene expression was verified 48 h after transfection.Quantitative PCR in HEK293 cellsTotal cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific). cDNA was obtained using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem) with random hexamers. qPCR were performed with a CFX Connect thermal cycler (Bio Rad) using Hot FIREpol EvaGreen qPCR SuperMix (Solis Biodyne) and standard primers. Samples were measured as triplicates. The relative expression of each gene was calculated according to the ΔΔCT method [64]. Expression of the housekeeping gene PPIA was used to normalize for variations in RNA input. Primers used were: AdipoR1-For (CCATCTGCTTGGTTTCGTGC) and -Rev (AGACGGTGTGAAAGAGCCAG), AdipoR2-For (TCATCTGTGTGCTGGGCATT) and -Rev (CTATCTGCCCTATGGTGGCG), GAPDH-For (GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT) and -Rev (TAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAGG), PPIA-For (GTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAG) and -Rev (GGACAAGATGCCAGGACCC), and SCD-For (TTCGTTGCCACTTTCTTGCG) and -Rev (TGGTGGTAGTTGTGGAAGCC).HEK293 fatty acid and FCCP treatmentPA and OA were dissolved in sterile DMSO (Sigma) then mixed with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in serum-free medium for 20 min at room temperature. The molecular ratio of BSA to fatty acid was 1 to 5.3 (except in the experiment using using 200 μM PA in which case the ratio was 1 to 2.65). Cells were then cultivated in this serum-free media containing the fatty acids for 24 h prior to analysis, and with 400 μM PA or OA being used unless stated otherwise. FCCP was dissolved in ethanol to produce a 30 mM stock and used at a concentration of 10 μM in serum-free-media for 4 hours prior to analysis.StatisticsError bars for worm length measurements show the standard error of the mean, and t-tests were used to identify significant differences between worm lengths. SFA/MUFA ratios were normalized using a logN conversion prior to test for significance using a t-test. Error bars for the frequency of the tail tip defect show the 95% confidence interval and significant differences determined using Z-tests. t-tests were also used to determine significance in FRAP experiments, and the lipidomics data in HEK293 cells was analyzed using ANOVA and a Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. All experiments were repeated several times with similar results.

Prior to enrichment, all rats were housed in standard opaque plastic cages (45 × 27 × 22 cm high) in groups of three or four, from weaning until placement in enrichment at the stated ages. For each age group, on the first day of enrichment, 24 rats were re-housed in two enrichment cages (12 per cage) for either 14 or 28 days (1 cage per time-period; Enriched-14-day and Enriched-28-day). Twelve remaining rats were re-housed with new cage mates in standard cages (3 rats per cage) for the same time periods (2 cages per time-period; 6 rats total per time-period; Standard-14-day and Standard-28-day). All rats were rehoused with novel cage mates. Rats were maintained on a reversed light-dark cycle (lights off 08:00–20:00 h) and colony rooms were maintained at 22°C and 48% relative humidity. Food and water were available ad libitum. All procedures conformed to the NIH guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the University of Canterbury Animal Ethics Committee.EnrichmentA standardized enrichment protocol developed at the University of Canterbury was used (Harland et al., 2014; and see http://www.psyc.canterbury.ac.nz/Standardized%20Enrichment.shtml for details of, objects, arrangements and procedures). Enrichment cages were made of wire mesh with a sawdust covered metal floor and measured 85 cm x 60 cm x 30 cm high. Each day of enrichment consisted of a different combination of “junk” objects such as ceramic figurines, metal chains, PVC pipes and junctions and other small items, along with an ever-present wooden block to discourage chewing of enrichment objects. Enrichment configurations differed over 40 different days (though a maximum of 28 was used here) and ensured no object was repeated within 5 days of itself. On every seventh day, PVC pipes and junctions were presented in a “tubing only” day, and on every eighth day, all objects (except the wooden blocks) were removed from the cage. Additionally, food and water positions were changed daily, and cages were rotated through one of four possible positions in the colony room every fourth day. Objects were changed at the start of the dark period (between 09:00 and10:00h), during which rats from one enrichment cage were held together in a large opaque plastic cage (62 × 40 × 22 cm high).Sacrifice and tissue extractionAfter either 14 or 28 full days of enrichment, or the same period of standard housing with new cage mates, rats were placed in standard cages at the same time enrichment objects were usually changed and held in a novel, dimly lit room separate to both the colony room and tissue dissection room. Rats from Enriched and Standard Housing were euthanised throughout a single day, with two Enriched rats sacrificed per one Standard Housed, and order of sacrifice randomized within these groups of three. Rats were deeply anesthetised with an overdose of Sodium Pentobarbitone (1mL, 300 mg/mL, ip). Once unresponsive to both tail pinch and plantar reflex (~5 min following injection), with no discernible heartbeat, rats were decapitated, and brains rapidly removed from the skull and placed in a brain matrix (Ted Pella). An initial coronal cut was made at the level of the optic tract. Additional coronal cuts were made 5 mm anterior and posterior to the initial cut, resulting in two “slabs” of fresh tissue (anterior extent approximately equivalent to Bregma +3.20 mm; posterior extent approximately equivalent to Bregma −6.30 mm; from the atlas of Paxinos and Watson, 1998). These tissue slabs were placed anterior-face-upwards on a glass petri dish, previously sterilized with 70% ethanol and rinsed with saline. Sterilization and rinsing was repeated between rats. Microdissection scissors were used to acquire tissue samples from seven regions of interest, starting in the posterior slab, in the order: occipital cortex, retrosplenial cortex (containing both dysgranular and granular B tissue), dorsal hippocampus (left and right hemispheres separately), mammillary bodies, hypothalamus and medial prefrontal cortex. Tissue samples were placed in pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes, weighed, and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen, within 15 min post-sacrifice, before long-term storage at −80°C.Tissue preparation and peptide measurementsCNP and NTproCNP were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), described in detail in (Yandle et al. (1993) CNP) and (Yandle et al. (1993) NTproCNP). Prior to assay, frozen tissue samples were transferred to dry ice chilled scintillation vials, then 10 mL of boiling distilled water containing 0.01% Triton X-100 was added and the vials were held at 98°C in a water bath for 5 min. Samples were acidified with 610 μL glacial acetic acid and homogenized prior to extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Following extraction, samples were dried under an air stream and frozen for later re-suspension in assay buffer for RIA. All tissues from an individual rat were processed in the same extraction, with tissues from housing groups counterbalanced across extractions.CNP assayCNP-22 is identical in all mammals studied thus far. CNP-22 and the amino terminal extended form CNP-53, both contain the 17-amino acid ring essential for bioactivity and show 100% cross reactivity in the assay used to measure CNP. Antiserum to CNP-22 (G-012-03, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) was diluted 1:2,000 with assay buffer. Labeled CNP was prepared by chloramine-T iodination of [Tyr0] CNP-22 (Peninsula Labs) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fifty microliters each of antiserum and CNP standard (0.7–235 pmol/L) or sample extract (all in duplicate) were mixed and incubated for 22–24 h at 4°C, followed by addition of 50 μL labeled CNP containing 2,000 cpm for 22–24 h at 4°C. Bound and free labeled CNP were separated by a solid-phase secondary antibody method (Sac-cell, Rabbit-Anti Goat, IDS Ltd., England). CNP assays had a detection limit of 0.6 pmol/L and ED50 of 7.3 pmol/L; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5.9 and 7.4%, respectively, at 17 pmol/L.NTproCNP assayFor NTproCNP an in-house antiserum was used that recognizes the C-terminal epitope in the region of proCNP (38–50), which is identical in human, mouse, and rat (Prickett et al., 2012). Fifty microliters of sample extract or 0.5–372 pmol/L proCNP(36–50) standards (again in duplicate) were incubated with 50 μL ovine antiserum (Sheep43) for 22–24 h, followed by addition of 50 μL tracer solution (proCNP(38-50)-[125I]Tyr37) containing 2,000 cpm for 22–24 h at 4°C. Bound and free labeled proCNP were separated by solid-phase second antibody method (Sac-cell, Donkey-Anti Sheep, IDS Ltd., England). NTproCNP assays had a detection limit of 0.4 pmol/L and ED50 9.9 pmol/L; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 6.8 and 7.5%, respectively, at 45 pmol/L.Statistical analysesCNP and NTproCNP concentrations were expressed as femtomoles per gram of wet tissue (fmol/g). NTproCNP:CNP ratio was calculated by dividing NTproCNP concentration by CNP concentration. In young rats, CNP assay failed in one sample from each of retrosplenial (Standard-14-day group) and occipital (Enriched-14-day group) cortices and data was excluded, reducing sample Ns in these regions. In aged rats, a portion of one sample from the hypothalamus (Enriched-28-day group) was lost, and data subsequently excluded. Two tissue samples had NTproCNP concentrations beyond the detection limit of the assay: one from mammillary bodies (Enriched-14-day group) and one from hypothalamus (Enriched-28-day group). Thus, sample Ns for aged rats are reduced for each of these regions (mammillary bodies and hypothalamus). In both age groups, final Ns for all other regions were: Enriched-14-day, N = 12; Enriched-28-day, N = 12; Standard-14-day, N = 6; Standard-28-day, N = 6. Initial analysis indicated there were no differences in any measure (CNP, NTproCNP or ratio) between left and right hemispheres of the dorsal hippocampus. Data was averaged across hemispheres for each rat and analyzed as a single value. Data acquisition and analysis for Young rats was conducted prior to acquisition of Aged rat data. As the Null Hypothesis was rejected in most cases for Young rats (see results), data from Aged rats were compared directly using cohen's d effect sizes. Analysis of data for Young rats was by Robust 2-way ANOVA with 20% trimmed means (after Mair and Wilcox, 2016; using WRS2 package for “R”). The statistical outcome measure of this test—Q—is interpreted in the same fashion as the traditional F statistic. Post-hoc testing of Young rats and Aged rat comparisons by effect size (cohen's d [± 95% CI]) calculations were all based on trimmed measures (using compute.es package for “R”). Figures provide boxplots displaying trimmed mean, standard error and 95% confidence intervals, overlaid with all data points (constructed using ggplot2 for “R”).", "Results": "ResultsNTproCNP concentrationsFor Young rats, NTproCNP concentrations did not vary in occipital cortex (Figure 1; overall M [95% CI] = 749.38 [691.36, 807.40]), medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 2; overall M [95% CI] = 1847.26 [1739.99, 1954.53]), or mammillary bodies (Figure 4; overall M [95% CI] = 4938.76 [4519.69, 5357.83]). NTproCNP concentrations also did not vary for Aged rats in occipital cortex (Figure 1; overall M [95% CI] = 854.61 [801.54, 907.68]), medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 2; overall M [95% CI] = 1599.42 [1448.72, 1750.12]), or mammillary bodies (Figure 4; overall M [95% CI] = 4245.68 [3547.89, 4943.48]). Concentrations of NTproCNP for Aged rats were higher than for Young rats in occipital cortex (Figure 1; d = 0.62 [0.14, 1.11], p = 0.01), lower than Young rats in medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 2; d = 0.62 [0.14, 1.10], p = 0.01), and equivalent in mammillary bodies (Figure 4). In retrosplenial cortex of Young rats (Figure 3), NTproCNP concentrations were lower at 14 days after rehousing than 28 days after rehousing, in Standard cages only (Housing x Time Interaction: Q(1, 31) = 6.40, p = 0.026; Young-Standard-14-day vs. Young-Standard-28-day (d = 2.12 [0.41, 3.83], p = 0.02). No significant between group differences were identified for NTproCNP for Aged rats in retrosplenial cortex (Figure 3). In dorsal hippocampus, NTproCNP concentrations were lower in Enriched housing than Standard housing, regardless of Time since rehousing (Figure 5; Main effect of Housing: Q(1, 32) = 7.55, p = 0.017; Young-Enriched vs. Young-Standard d = 0.87 [0.12, 1.62], p = 0.02). Again, no effects were identified in Aged rats (Figure 5). In hypothalamus, NTproCNP concentrations were higher following 14 days of rehousing than 28 days, regardless of Housing condition (Figure 6; Main effect of Time Q(1, 32) = 11.05, p = 0.01; Young-14-day vs. Young-28-day d = 1.13 [0.4, 1.86], p < 0.001). This effect was also not apparent in Aged rats (Figure 6).CNP concentrationsFor Young rats, significant two-way interactions (Housing × Time) were identified in occipital cortex [Q(1, 31) = 16.77, p = 0.001], medial prefrontal cortex [Q(1, 32) = 12.56, p = 0.003], retrosplenial cortex [Q(1, 31) = 4.45, p = 0.055] and mammillary bodies [Q(1, 32) = 7.41, p = 0.015]. In each region (Figures 1–4), CNP concentrations were elevated in Young-Enriched-14-day rats compared to all other groups of rats (between group comparisons, Table 1). Additionally, in retrosplenial cortex CNP concentrations were reduced across time since rehousing for Standard Housed rats (Young-Standard-14-days vs. Young-Standard-28-days d = 1.37 [0.21, 2.54], p = 0.02). In dorsal hippocampus, higher concentrations of CNP were seen 14 days after rehousing with new cage mates, regardless of type of Housing [Figure 5; Main Effect of Time: Q(1, 32) = 5.74, p = 0.03; Young-14-day vs. Young-28-day d = 0.7 [0, 1.4], p = 0.05]. Although there was no significant effect of Housing, highest concentrations of CNP occurred within Young-Enriched-14-day rats (Figure 5). In hypothalamus, significant Main Effects of Housing [Q(1, 32) = 12.66, p = 0.002] and Time [Q(1, 32) = 21.00, p = 0.001] were such that CNP concentrations were higher in Enriched rats than Standard Housed rats, and higher 14 days following rehousing with new cage mates (Figure 6). The additive nature of these effects was reflected in significantly higher concentrations of CNP in Young-Enriched-14-day rats vs. all other groups (between group comparisons, Table 1).For Aged rats, CNP concentrations did not vary significantly in any region, in individual group comparisons (Figures 1–6). The sole effect on CNP concentrations identified within Aged rats was in medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 2), wherein CNP concentrations were higher 14 days after rehousing with new cage mates than at 28 days of rehousing (d = 0.68 [−0.01, 1.38], p = 0.005). CNP concentrations for Aged rats overall were lower than the peak seen in Young-Enriched-14-day rats in occipital cortex, retrosplenial cortex, mammillary bodies and hypothalamus (between group comparisons, Table 1). In occipital and retrosplenial cortices (Figures 1, 3), CNP concentrations were higher in Aged rats than for other Young rats (i.e., excluding Young-Enriched-14-day rats; between group comparisons, Table 1). In the Aged hippocampus, concentrations of CNP were equivalent to Young rats rehoused for 14 days (d = 0.12 [−0.46, 0.47], ns), but higher than Young rats rehoused for 28 days (d = −1.01 [−1.62, −0.4], p < 0.001).NTproCNP:CNP ratioFor Young rats, significant two-way interactions were identified in occipital cortex [Q(1, 31) = 14.76, p = 0.004], medial prefrontal cortex [Q(1, 32) = 49.00, p = 0.001], retrosplenial cortex [Q(1, 31) = 5.55, p = 0.039] and mammillary bodies [Q(1, 32) = 9.20, p = 0.009]. In each region (Figures 1–4) NTproCNP:CNP ratio was reduced in Young-Enriched-14-day rats compared with all other Young rats (between group comparisons, Table 2). In dorsal hippocampus (Figure 5), NTproCNP:CNP ratio was lower 14 days following rehousing than at 28 days of rehousing [Main Effect of Time: Q(1, 32) = 15.87, p = 0.003] and lower in rats housed in Enrichment than in Standard cages [Main Effect of Housing: Q(1, 32) = 7.03, p = 0.026]. Lowest ratio values therefore occurred in Young-Enriched-14-day rats, but this difference was not significant compared with Young-Standard-14-day rats (between group comparisons, Table 2). In hypothalamus (Figure 6), NTproCNP:CNP ratio was lower in Enriched rats than Standard Housed rats [Main Effect of Housing: Q(1, 32) = 12.08, p = 0.005]. However, an overall mean comparison was not statistically significant (Young-Standard vs. Young-Enriched d = 0.55 [−0.18, 1.28], p = 0.14). Only Young-Enriched-14-day rats had lower ratio values than Young Standard Housed rats (between group comparisons, Table 2).NTproCNP:CNP ratio did not generally vary across groups for Aged rats (Figures 1–6). Overall, NTproCNP:CNP ratio for Aged rats was lower than Young rats (excluding Young-Enriched-14-day rats) in occipital, medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices, and hypothalamus (between group comparisons, Table 2), but not in mammillary bodies or dorsal hippocampus."}, "stats": {"Methods": {"chars": 9161, "tokens": 1419, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 6248, "tokens": 970, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience", "year": "2018", "doi": "10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00142", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Patient 1 (P1) carried a heterozygous mutation 2249G > A in the TSC1 gene, resulting in a de novo mutation W750X reported earlier (Jones et al., 1999); Patient 2 (P2) had a single nucleotide duplication (1563dupA in TSC2 gene resulting in frameshift mutation H522T). Control iPSC lines were generated from one infant (C1) and two teenagers (C2, C3). Several iPSC clones were obtained from each patient and control fibroblast line and verified by sequencing (Figures 1A–1C). To characterize TSC patient and control iPSCs for pluripotency, we performed standard assays, including immunocytochemistry for markers OCT3&4, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-80, and expression of alkaline phosphatase (Figures S1A–S1F).To investigate how the patient TSC mutations change TSC1 and TSC2 protein expression, we performed western blot analysis (Figures 1D and 1E). The stoichiometric ratio of TSC1 and TSC2 proteins are known to be tightly regulated in the cell, so changes in the level of one TSC protein could be expected to lead to changes of the other TSC protein level. Indeed when we investigated the TSC1 and TSC2 proteins of both patients we found this to be the case. The level of one TSC patient was obtained by averaging the levels of different iPSC clones of that patient: four clones for both P1 and P2 (Figures 1D–1F). By comparing the average levels of the patients (P1 and P2) to the average levels of the controls (C1–C3), we found a significant reduction in both TSC1 (p < 0.03) and TSC2 (p < 0.004) in TSC iPSCs (Figures 1D and 1E). The TSC protein levels are controlled for loading and blotting, by measuring the total protein content on the blot, as described by previous studies (Gurtler et al., 2013, Rivero-Gutierrez et al., 2014), although a protein control actin is shown in Figure 1F. We selected two iPSC clones hVS-233 (P1A) and hVS-248 (P1B) from P1, one iPSC clone hVS-417 (P2C) from P2, and control iPSC clones hVS-88 (C1), hVS-228 (C2), and hVS-421 (C3) for the following experiments. Overall, the TSC patient iPSCs showed a significant reduction in both TSC1 and TSC2 proteins compared with the controls, but expressed normal stem cell properties, justifying a combined study of both TSC1 and TSC2 patients.Increased Neuronal Activity in TSC Patient iPSC-Derived Neuron Mono-culturesNetwork hyperexcitability has been reported in several models of TSC (Bateup et al., 2013, Lasarge and Danzer, 2014, Wang et al., 2007). To investigate neuronal activity in TSC patients, we generated neuronal cultures from controls C1, C2, and C3, and patient lines P1A, P1B, and P2, according to established protocols (Nadadhur et al., 2017). At day 56, we measured spontaneous calcium transients in the neuronal cultures (standard [Std] conditions; Figures 2A and 2C). Under Std conditions, the spontaneous calcium influx frequency in the networks was significantly higher (p < 0.01, post hoc test) in the TSC neurons (0.12 ± 0.01 Hz; Figures 2C and 2E) compared with the control neuron cultures (0.065 ± 0.008 Hz; Figures 2A and 2E). We further studied whether mTOR pathway inhibition, by administration of Rapa (Std + Rapa) or IGF-1 (Std + IGF-1), modulated the spontaneous calcium transients (Figures 2B and 2D). The frequency of calcium transients in TSC neuron cultures treated with Rapa (Figure 2D) or IGF-1 (Figures S2G and S2L) reduced to around 0.09 ± 0.006 and 0.089 ± 0.01 Hz, respectively, whereas the frequency in control neurons after Rapa and IGF-1 treatment remained around 0.069 ± 0.009 and 0.07 ± 0.008, respectively (Figures 2B and S2F). The reduction in the total event area in the TSC cultures (2.3 ± 0.3) compared with control cultures (4.2 ± 0.9) under Std conditions showed a trend toward statistical significance (p = 0.08; Figures 2F and S2M). Lastly, event amplitudes between TSC and control neurons were similar (Figures 2G and S2N). Overall, the increased event frequency in the TSC neurons suggests an increase in neuronal activity, i.e., spontaneous firing, which was diminished by treatment with Rapa or IGF-1.To further assess activity, we measured spontaneous action potential firing of neuronal cultures from controls C1, C2, patient lines P1A and P2, differentiated and plated on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). At day 106 under Std conditions, the neuronal firing (measured as spike rate) was significantly higher in TSC neurons (p < 0.03, unpaired t test; 1.09 ± 0.14 Hz; Figure 2K) compared with the control cells (0.53 ± 0.14 Hz; Figure 2I), which significantly reduced to control levels, i.e., 0.52 ± 0.08 Hz upon Rapa treatment (p < 0.02, unpaired t test; Figures 2L and 2H). ANOVA analysis between the four groups did not show a statistically significant difference. Altogether, we found higher spontaneous neuronal firing in TSC neuron mono-cultures suggesting an increased neuronal activity, which was modulated to control levels after Rapa treatment.Morphological Analysis Only Reveals Increased Dendritic Arborization in TSC Neuron Mono-culturesTo investigate whether TSC patient iPSC-derived neuron cultures show morphological changes, we measured the axonal density in the cultures under Std, Std + Rapa, and Std + IGF-1 conditions at day 56 (Figures 3A and S2A). No significant changes in axonal densities (SMI312-positive pixels/DAPI-positive cell) were observed in the TSC (Figure 3D) compared with the control neuron mono-cultures (Figures 3B–3E). As hypertrophy is a known phenotype of TSC (Ruppe et al., 2014), we further measured neuronal soma size (Nissl-positive pixels/DAPI-positive cell). We did not observe differences in the soma size in the TSC compared with the control neuron cultures, under Std or Std + Rapa (Figure 3J), or under Std + IGF-1 conditions (Figure S2H). To assess differences in dendritic and synaptic density between TSC patient and control neuron cultures, we performed staining for dendritic marker MAP2 and pre-synaptic marker Synaptophysin1 (Figures 3F–3I, S2D, and S2E). No significant changes in the synaptic (Figure 3M) and the dendritic densities (Figure 3L) were found between the TSC and control neuron mono-cultures under Std, Std + Rapa, or Std + IGF-1 conditions (Figures S2K and S2J). To study changes in basal dendritic branching, prominent in TSC (Jaworski and Sheng, 2006), we utilized NeurphologyJ, an ImageJ plugin, to measure the number of dendritic branches per neuron (i.e., attachment points per cell; Figures 3O and S2P), and the ratio between number of branches per neuron and the dendritic ends (i.e., attachment points/endpoints; Figures 3N and S2O). Interestingly, the TSC cultures showed a significant increase in the dendritic branching, as measured by attachment points per cell (p < 0.02, ANOVA: p < 0.02; Tukey's post hoc test), and attachment points/endpoints (p < 0.0002, ANOVA: p < 0.0002, Tukey's post hoc test) compared with control neuron cultures, which was normalized after Rapa treatment (Figures 3N and 3O). The total number of neurons in the cultures (Figures 3P and S2Q) remained around 50 to 65 per field of view (FOV) for all groups. Altogether, although neurite densities did not change and hypertrophy was not observant, the TSC neurons do exhibit an increased basal dendritic branching compared with control neuron mono-cultures.TSC Neuron-OL Co-cultures Show Hypertrophy and an Increased Neurite DensityAxonal changes and hypertrophy have been reported in brain tissue of TSC patients (Ruppe et al., 2014) and TSC mouse models (Meikle et al., 2007). Considering the white matter defects in TSC (Ruppe et al., 2014) and the mTOR pathway involvement in OL development and maturation (Meikle et al., 2007, Wahl et al., 2014), we examined whether neuronal abnormalities increase through complex interactions with OLs. To measure morphological changes in neuron-glia cultures, we grew co-cultures of neurons and OLs from TSC and control cells (CN + CO, CN + PO, PN + CO, and PN + PO). We first generated neurons and OLs separately and later co-cultured neurons (day 37) and OLs (day 65) under Std conditions for another 28 days and included treatments with Rapa (Std + Rapa) or Guana (Std + Guana) from day 7 of co-culture on (Figures 4A and S4A). Since IGF- administration could affect OL generation, we used Rapa and Guana as mTOR pathway modulators. The axonal density significantly changed between the different co-cultures (p < 0.004, ANOVA; Figures 4A–4D and 4I). The PN + PO culture showed a statistically significant 4-fold increase in axonal density compared with the CN + CO (p < 0.01, Tukey's post hoc test). CN + PO cultures appeared to be similar to control co-cultures and statistically different from PN + PO (p < 0.03, Tukey's post hoc test) cultures (Figures 4A–4D and 4I). This suggested that the increased axonal density did not increase just through elevated signaling from TSC OLs. Consistent with this hypothesis, PN + CO cultures showed a 3-fold increase in axonal density compared with CN + CO and CN + PO cultures, although not significant with a post hoc test. Treatments with Rapa or Guana did not suppress the increased axonal density (Figures 4I and S4B). The total number of cells in the co-cultures under Std and treated conditions remained the same (Figure S4F). Therefore, when co-cultures contained both TSC neurons and TSC OLs, the axonal density significantly increased compared with cultures containing control neurons, which was unaffected by treatment with Rapa or Guana.The soma size also significantly changed between the different co-cultures (p < 0.007, ANOVA; Figures 4E–4H and 4J). There was a statistically significant difference in soma size between PN + PO and CN + CO cultures (p < 0.02, Tukey's post hoc test), and between the Std and the Std + Rapa condition in the PN + CO culture (p < 0.04, Tukey's post hoc test; Figure 4J). The decrease between the Std and the Std + Rapa condition in the CN + PO and PN + PO cultures was not statistically significant (Figure 4J). Treatments with Guana did not normalize increased soma size (Figure S4C). Altogether, when co-cultures contained both TSC neurons and TSC OLs, the soma size significantly increased compared with cultures containing control neurons and control OLs. Rapa showed regulating effects on soma size when co-cultures contained TSC neurons and/or TSC OLs.To study how interactions between TSC neurons and TSC OLs affect the density of neuronal processes after long periods of time, we transplanted control (CN + CO) and TSC (PN + PO) neuron-OL populations into the brain of immunocompromised RAG2null mice. After transplanting neuronal populations, we observed an abundant incorporation of human (HN-positive) cells in the mouse brain at 2.5 months post-transplantation (Figures S5A and S5B). To identify the human neurons in the mixed neuron-OL grafts, they were labeled with Synapsin-GFP viral construct before transplantation of mixed neuron-OL populations. HN-positive and GFP-positive cells were spread over several brain regions including the cerebral cortex (Figures S5C–S5F), the caudate putamen, and the olfactory bulb. While the total number of grafted control and patient neurons remained the same (Figure S5G), the average neurite length (GFP pixel density per HN-positive soma) in the PN + PO grafts (7,349 ± 1,247) was significantly higher (p < 0.02) compared with the CN + CO grafts (3,504 ± 233; Figure S5H). Therefore, mixed TSC neuron-OL populations showed increased neurite densities compared with control neuron-OL grafts at 2.5 months post-transplantation. Overall, changes in neurite density and hypertrophy in TSC patient cells can be measured in mixed neuron-OL populations both in vitro and in vivo, which can be partially altered by mTOR regulators.Altered OL Properties in Mixed TSC Neuron-OL PopulationsAs TSC patients show glial dysfunctions, we further investigated whether TSC neuron-OL co-cultures show OL abnormalities. To study whether TSC neuron-OL co-cultures affected OL maturation, we analyzed the ratio of MBP/OLIG2-positive cells in the different co-cultures with and without Rapa or Guana treatment (Figures 5B–5F and S4D). While ANOVA analysis did not show significant changes (Figure 5F), t test analysis showed a significant decrease in OL maturation in PN + PO (0.04 ± 0.003) compared with CN + CO (0.13 ± 0.03; p < 0.03, t test) cultures, which improved after treatment with Rapa and Guana (0.10 ± 0.03 and 0.07 ± 0.004, respectively; Figures 5F and S4D). Overall, TSC neuron-OL co-cultures showed reduced maturation, which was improved by Rapa and Guana treatment.To study whether co-cultures with TSC neurons and/or OLs affected OL proliferation, we measured the number of OLs in mono- and co-cultures. In mono-cultures, we found a significant 2-fold increase in the number of OLIG2-positive cells in TSC (OLIG2/DAPI cells; p < 0.02, unpaired t test, Figures S3A–S3C) compared with control. We further found an increase in the number of the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells 2 hr post addition in the TSC cultures (Figures S3D–S3F), confirming increased proliferation. However, there were no changes in the number of BrdU-positive cells 1 week post BrdU labeling (Figures S3G–S3I), suggestive of cell death in TSC cultures, which was further confirmed by an increase in the cleaved caspase 3-positive cells in TSC glial cultures (Figures S3J–S3L). In co-cultures, we also found significant changes in the number of OLs (OLIG2/DAPI cells) between the different groups (one-way ANOVA; p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis showed a 4-fold significant increase (p < 0.0002, Tukey's post hoc test) in the number of OLIG2-positive cells in the PN + PO (0.22 ± 0.05; Figures 5E and 5G) compared with the CN + CO (0.048 ± 0.01; Figures 5B and 5G) cultures. In addition, when the TSC OLs were co-cultured with control neurons (CN + PO; 0.15 ± 0.01; Figures 5C and 5G), a three-times significant increase (p < 0.01, Tukey's post hoc test) in the OLIG2/DAPI-positive cells compared with CN + CO cultures was observed. The PN + CO cultures (Figure 5D) showed no significant changes in the OLIG2/DAPI-positive cells compared with CN + CO cultures (Figure 5G), indicating that TSC patient neurons do not affect proliferation levels of control OLs. Interestingly, PN + PO cultures under Std + Rapa conditions were significantly reduced compared with PN + PO cultures under Std conditions (p < 0.04; Tukey's post hoc test; Figure 5G). Treatment with Guana did not normalize OL numbers (Figure S4E). Hence, TSC patient OL cultures show increased proliferation, which increased in co-culture with control and TSC neurons, which was modulated by Rapa.To study proliferation of TSC OLs in vivo, transplanted control (CN + CO) and TSC (PN + PO) neuron-OL populations were studied 2.5 months post-transplantation. Human OL somas were traced by OLIG2 and HN double labeling. The numbers of TSC OLs in the PN + PO grafts (0.33 ± 0.02) were significantly increased (p < 0.02) compared with OL numbers in the CN + CO grafts (0.12 ± 0.03; Figure S5I). So, after in vivo transplantation, the number of OLs increased in the grafted mixed TSC neuron-OL populations.Altogether, TSC patient OLs showed a significantly increased proliferation when co-cultured with control neurons, which further increased by the addition of TSC patient neurons both in vitro and in vivo, and could be normalized by Rapa treatment.", "Experimental Procedures": "Experimental ProceduresiPSCs and Neuronal CulturesTSC patient (P1, GM06149; P2, GM03958) and control fibroblasts (C3, GM23973) were obtained from the Coriell Biorepository (all teenage donors), and controls C1 (infant) and C2 (teenage) were obtained from anonymous control donors. The selected TSC patients were reported with mental retardation and seizures along with other TSC-related abnormalities. iPSC reprogramming was done based on polycistronic construct with OCT3/4, c-MYC, SOX2, and KLF4 (Warlich et al., 2011). All the iPSC lines were cultured in Essential 8 medium (Gibco) on Geltrex LDEV-free (Gibco). Generation of in-direct contact iPSC-neuronal mono-cultures was performed as described earlier (Nadadhur et al., 2017) with slight modifications. Neuronal mono-cultures with a density of 62.5 K/2.0 cm2 in the Std condition medium contained Neurobasal composition with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (20 ng/mL; Peprotech) and cAMP (1 μM; Sigma). The Std + IGF-1 and Std + Rapa conditions contained Std medium with IGF-1 (10 ng/mL; Peprotech) or Rapa (30 nM; Sigma), respectively. For detailed culturing methods and culture conditions for MEA experiments please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Glial Cells and Co-culturesOLs were obtained as described previously (Izrael et al., 2007). Before neuron-OL co-cultures were generated, we first separately created neuron mono-cultures (62.5 K/2.0 cm2 density) until day 37 (Nadadhur et al., 2017) and OL progenitors until day 65. To generate neuron-OL co-cultures, the neuronal coverslips were removed from rat astrocyte feeder plates and OL progenitors were passaged with Accutase (Millipore) and plated at a density of 200 K/2.0 cm2 on neuronal coverslips. The co-cultures were maintained in Std co-culture medium (DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal [1:1; both Gibco], 1% N1 supplement [in-house], 2% B27 supplement [Gibco], 1% NEAA [Gibco], 60 ng/mL T3 [Sigma], 100 ng/mL Biotin [Sigma] medium with NT3 [10 ng/mL; Peprotech], mouse laminin [1 μg/mL; Sigma], BDNF [20 ng/mL], and cAMP [1 μM]). From day 1 to 7 of co-culture, all cells were refreshed with Std medium. From day 8 to 28 of co-culture, cells were refreshed with either Std, Std + Guana (5 μM; Sigma) or Std + Rapa (10 nM) medium twice a week. At day 28 of co-culture, the cell culture coverslips were processed for immunocytochemistry.Calcium ImagingAt day 56, neuronal mono-culture coverslips were incubated with Fluo-5-AM ester 1 μM in Neurobasal medium without growth factors for 5 min at 37°C and imaged under constant perfusion at 0.5 mL/min rate with Tyrode's solution (119 NaCl. 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 30 glucose; all in mM) in an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× oil objective (numerical aperture 1.3; Zeiss), a Polychrome IV light source (TILL Photonics), a 488/6 nm excitation filter (Semrock), a 525/50-nm emission filter (Semrock), and a 500-nm beam splitter (Semrock). Images (1 image/s) were acquired using a Cascade 512 EM-CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and Metamorph 6.2 software (Molecular Devices). The total length of 4.5 min was recorded per FOV, and a minimum of five FOVs per coverslip was recorded each from two to four differentiations for three controls and three TSC lines. For analysis, image series were stacked using z stack projection in ImageJ, and regions of interest were placed on a minimum of 12 neurites per FOV. Calcium traces were detected using “event detection analysis (EVA)” with previously described methods in MATLAB (Hjorth et al., 2016).MEA60MEA200/30iR-Tigr MEAs were used. Spontaneous activity was recorded, for a period of 10 min, every 10 days at 37°C using MC Rack at a sample rate of 25,000 Hz. Electrode data were filtered online with a 200 Hz high pass and a 5,000 Hz low pass filter (both second-order Butterworth). Data were stored as .mcd files, which contain the filtered continuous traces for each electrode together with the spikes detected using the online threshold detection built into MC Rack. After selecting electrodes for analysis, chosen data were converted to asci files for offline analysis using the MC Data tool. Offline analysis was achieved with custom scripts written in MATLAB. Spikes were detected from filtered data using an automatic threshold-based method set at −5.5×σ, where σ is an estimate of the noise of each electrode. Spike timestamps were analyzed to provide statistics on the general excitability of cultures. The average spike rate (Hz) represents the median of the average spike rate for all electrodes (AvgSpkRateE1-n). The average spike rate for each electrode (AvgSpkRateE) was calculated as AvgSpkRateE = number of spikes/tmax, where tmax is the total length of the recording in seconds. This is used to control for particularly high or low firing rates.ImmunofluorescenceFor immunocytochemistry, neuronal mono-cultures and neuron-OL co-culture coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min and processed for staining. For immunohistochemistry, slides were washed with PBS (6 times for 5 min each in PBS 1×), optionally treated for 2 min with citrate buffer (0.01 M [pH 6]) for antigen retrieval, followed by washing in PBS (5 min for 1 time). All the coverslips/slides were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in blocking buffer (5% NGS, 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS 1×), incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Next day, after washing again with PBS (6 times for 5 min each), the coverslips/slides were incubated with secondary antibody solution for 2 hr, washed again (6× for 5 min), and then mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) on glass slides (VWR; Super frost plus)/glass coverslips. Images were acquired from stained slides using either a Carl Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope with 40× (1.2 numerical aperture) oil objective or a Leica DM6000B fluorescent microscope with 10×, 20×, and 40× magnification. For details of primary antibodies used please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Cell Property AnalysisCell properties such as axonal density, dendritic density, soma size, and the number of synapses; OLIG2- and MBP-positive cells were measured using Columbus 2.5 online software. Precisely, images acquired with confocal and fluorescent microscope were analyzed with algorithms for morphology, soma recognition, and co-localization tools using pixel density measurement and the number of objects present, respectively. To quantify the soma sizes and morphological parameters, pixel densities were measured in each FOV (6–10 per condition/coverslip) with images of 20× or 40× magnification. To quantify dendritic branching, the NeurophologyJ tool was used in ImageJ.Western Blot AnalysisCell lysates were collected from feeder-free iPSCs at day 3 or 4 after passage and from neuroepithelial stem cells between P1 and P5. SDS-PAGE was run on Bolt 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween, followed by primary antibody incubations at 1:1,000 concentration in 5% BSA in TBS-0.05% Tween and incubated ON at 4°C (primary antibodies are listed in Supplement Information). The blots were then washed thrice for 10 min with TBS-Tween and incubated with secondary antibody in milk-TBS-Tween for 1 hr at RT. After washing thrice again, bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific) on Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR). Primary antibodies against TSC1 (no. 6935) and TSC2 (no. 4308; both from Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1,000 concentrations.

SNV profiles have been used earlier to re-identify the lung and colorectal cancer cell lines as well as HeLa contamination but these studies were limited to only few cell lines [5, 11]. In this study we have made an attempt to use variants derived from RNA-seq data for large-scale cell line authentication.Variant analysisRNA-seq data for 934 cell lines available from the NCI GDC legacy portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) were downloaded and bam files were processed to call variants using an in-house pipeline described earlier in the methods section. Additionally, WES data for 326 cell lines available from GDC were also obtained and variants were identified. A total of 1,027,428 of variants were identified across all the cell lines with an average of 27,310 variants per cell line. As shown in Fig. 1a, all variant profiles of RNA-seq samples will be used to determine their correlation coefficient distribution and its corresponding significance level from CCLE collection, and the process to determine the CeL-ID accuracy and its robustness, followed by a validation procedure utilizing a collection of independently obtained MCF7 and HCT116 cells processed with different treatment [24, 25], and down-sampling of RNA-seq samples to explore how little sequence reads are required to achieve the equivalent identification accuracy.Cell line authentication using variant comparisonsWe performed the pair-wise comparisons of variant profiles of all the 934 cell lines and computed correlation coefficients. It is interesting to note that only a few pairs of cell lines showed high correlation coefficients (ρ > 0.8) whereas most other pairs show poor correlation (Fig. 2a and b). Moreover, most of the top identified cell line pairs with correlations (ρ > 0.9) were turned out to be known replicates, subclones, derived from same patients or have been known in the literature to share high SNP identity (CCLE legacy archive (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/data); Fig. 2a and b). As can be seen in Fig. 2a, correlation coefficients were used as distance metric to carry out hierarchical clustering. CCLE dataset happened to include replicates for two cell lines sequenced at different time and our CeL-ID method correctly identified these two pairs: G28849.HOP-62.3 & G41807.HOP-62.1 (ρ = 0.97), and G27298.EKVX.1 & G41811.EKVX.1 (ρ = 0.96). Moreover, pair – G20492.HEL_92.1.7.2 & G28844.HEL.3 also identified to be very similar (ρ = 0.96; Fig. 2c) are known to be subclones, whereas cell line pairs: G27249.AU565.1 & G27493.SK-BR-3.2, G30599.WM-266-4.1 & G30626.WM-115.1 and G28607.PA-TU-8988S.1 & G41691.PA-TU-8988 T.5 (cell line names are shown in Fig. 2a) were known to be derived from the same patient and hence share high variant identity. Additionally, other four pairs including the cell line pair G41726.MCF7.5 & G28020.KPL-1.1 were known to share high SNP identity and in some cases literature indicates that they are same or likely to be the same, for example, G27305.HCC-1588.1 is likely to be G41749.LS513.5 and G28614.ONCO-DG-1.1 is likely to be G26222.NIH_OVCAR3.2 (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/data). Majority of cell line pairs rightly show poor correlation (ρ < 0.6, Fig. 2a and b). The only anomaly we observed is from a subset of six cell lines (G27483.S-117.2, G28592.NCI-H155.1, G28551.MHH-CALL-2.1, G28045.KYSE-270.1, G27239.ACC-MESO-1.1 and G28088.LOU-NH91.1), which show pretty high correlation with each other (ρ = 0.83–0.89) but have different cells of origin and derived from different cancers. These cell lines may just happen to share high variant identity or somewhere during the cell culturing and maintenance cells got contaminated with each other. As expected, correlated cell lines tend to share more common mutations (Fig. 2b).Transcriptome profiles of any given cells are known to change during various treatments, and adapt to their environment as well. For base-line expression data provide through CCLE project, we can see their correlation holds for pair G20492.HEL_92.1.7.2 & G28844.HEL.3 (ρ = 0.95, Fig. 2d), and the next-to-best correlated sample is also NCI-H1155 (ρ = 0.787). Notice the difference of correlation coefficients of the best sample and the next-to-best samples are much smaller than those derived from variant profiles.Furthermore, we analyzed WES data for 326 cell lines available from NCI GDC. These 326 cell lines include 112 cell lines from the RNA-seq dataset. All the variants from WES data were identified using pipeline showed in Fig. 1a. We used variants derived from WES data to compare it with those of RNA-seq and a high degree of concordance was observed.Determination of the significance of correlation coefficientMoreover, to determine the significance of a detected correlation coefficient for a given cell line, all pair-wise correlations for 934 cell lines were generated. Distribution plot of correlation follows normal distribution N(μ,σ) (Fig. 3a, light blue histogram). Similar distribution is also observed in pair-wise correlation from WES samples (Fig. 3a, dark blue histogram). To estimate parameter distribution, we used truncated normal distribution model by removing correlation coefficients less than 0 (unlikely) and greater than 0.8 (replicate and derivative cell-lines in CCLE collection). For variant profiles derived from RNA-seq, parameters are (μ, σ) = (0.464, 0.047). Therefore, at L0.001 = 0.609, two samples will be considered similar with p < 0.001, or at L10-6 = 0.686 two samples will be unlikely similar (p < 10− 6). As a comparison, between RNA-seq and WES variant profiles (μ, σ) = (0.275, 0.042), excluding all pair-wise comparison between same cell lines (see Fig. 3a, left pink histogram).COSMIC SNVs and cell line re-identificationWe constrained the variants being used for correlation calculation to only those present in COSMIC70 and COSMIC83 databases [18]. This led to a huge reduction in number of variants. Only 4% of total variants matched to COSMIC70 and 14% matched to the latest cosmic database COSMIC83 (Table 1). To test the validity of using only the cancer mutations, we selected 6 pairs of cell lines that have either replicate or derivative cell lines in CCLE dataset (G41807.HOP-62.1, G28844.HEL.3, G27298.EKVX.1, G28607.PA-TU-8988S.1, G26187.MONO-MAC-1.2 and G26218.HEC-1-A.2, highlighted in brown color in Fig. 2a). Interestingly, we observed that only COSMIC matched variants are sufficient to correctly re-identify the cell lines (Fig. 3b). Only COSMIC70 showed relative poor performance with 2nd best match (beyond the pair) due to its lower number of SNPs for comparison. We note that using COSMIC mutation takes much less computation time for correlation coefficient evaluations across all cell lines.Robustness of the modelWe tested the robustness of CeL-ID method by adding noise (Gaussian noise with zero mean) to the allele frequency of variant data for six pairs of cell lines as aforementioned. As evident from the Fig. 4a, correlation drops significantly with increasing noise level and by the noise level σ = 15~20 cell line pair is not identifiable. Additionally, to estimate the false positive rate, we randomly permuted the mutation positions in these six cell lines and tried to find the other pair. We repeated it 100 times and as can be seen in Fig. 3b (last bar), with very low correlation coefficient (on average, ρ = 0.14).Moreover, we tested the robustness of CeL-ID method on two independent test sets. First independent test set comprises of 12 RNA-seq datasets for MCF7 cells, which were downloaded from GEO (GSE86316) and represents mRNA expression profiles in MCF7 cells after silencing of MEN1 using small hairpin or chemical inhibition that affected expression profile of selected group of transcripts [24]. The second independent set consists of 8 RNA-seq datasets for HCT116 cells. These were also obtained from GEO (GSE101966) and depict mRNA expression profiles in HCT116 cells after loss of ARID1A and ARID1B [25]. Variants were called using pipeline (Fig. 1a, light blue boxes) and as can be seen in Fig. 4b and c, even variants derived from altered mRNA expression profiles are sufficient for authentication/re-identification of cell lines. Additionally, it may be noted that even the use of a different aligner RSEM do not affect cell re-identification potential. As mentioned earlier, MCF-7 and KPL-1 are known to share high SNP identity and hence both rightly passed threshold for unique identification. We removed variants that shared between these two cell lines with difference FREQ greater than 10 and high coverage depth requirement, reducing 17,730 variants in first pass to 2631. Detail analysis results are provided in Table 2. Notice that second pass p-value is much higher, which is due to the removal of common variants, only assess the agreement with variant sites perhaps differentiate MCF7 and KPL-1. Similar results were also obtained for HCT116 cells and are provided in Additional file 2.Furthermore, to test the robustness of the system, effect of sequencing depth on the results was checked. We randomly selected nine cell lines and randomly subsampled it to 1 million (1 M), 2 million (2 M), 5 million (5 M), 10 million (10 M), 25 million (25 M), and 50 million (50 M) reads and ran the pipeline on subsampled subset of reads. As evident from the Fig. 4d, even smaller subset of up to 5 M reads covering only around 15% of total variants (red line/right axis, Fig. 4d) are enough for cell line authentication (top blue line/left axis, Fig. 4d). Similar results were observed for all subsampled sets from all nine cell lines, as indicated by small error bars (Fig. 4d), demonstrating that our method is robust enough up to 5 M reads sequencing depths. Only notable observation is the variation of correlation for the second best-match (lower blue line/left axis, Fig. 4d) increases with the reduction of total read counts, particularly at 1 M and 2 M read count levels, indicating lower read counts will render much fewer unique variants available for mutation calling, and increases the chance of false positive.Sample mix-up and contamination estimationCell line contamination is a major issue facing biomedical sciences [1, 9]. Human error and oversight are thought to be the main cause of cell line mix-ups and contamination. It’s necessary to have means to quality control these errors rapidly and periodically. Henceforth, we have developed a linear regression model (see Methods section, Fig. 1b) to estimate the level of mix-ups and contamination using variant frequencies from RNA-seq data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the deconvolution method, we first simulated observed data by mixing two selected frequencies datasets using Eqs. 4a and 4b. The exact steps are provided below:For example, we select G20492.HEL_92.1.7.2 as test sample (x1), and G20469.JHOS-2.2 as contaminant candidate (x2);Generate proportion q1 from a normal distribution with mean 0.85 and standard deviation 0.05 (or q1 ~ N(0.85, 0.05), and q2 ~ N(0.15, 0.05). We also tested proportion of 0.70/0.30, as shown in Fig. 5;Following Eq. 4a, we have z = q1 ∙ x1 + q2 ∙ x2 for both FREQ and DP;For each standard deviation σnoise = (0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20), we perform,4.1.Following Eq. 4b, we obtained y = z + N(0, σnoise) only for FREQ, and then reset y to 0 if y < 0, and 100 if y > 100;4.2.Calling function CCLE_Identification() to identify dominant cell-line, or provide cell line identification. For our particular example selection and for σ = 0.01, we obtained:1st match cell-line = G20492.HEL_92.1.7.2, with ρ = 0.97, p = 9.762 × 10− 272nd match cell-line = G28844.HEL.3, with ρ = 0.90, p = 1.768 × 10− 203rd match cell-line = G25242.K-562.3, with ρ = 0.47, p = 0.514Note that 2nd matched cell line (HEL.3) is the cell line that has a high correlation with HEL_92.1.7.2 (See Fig. 2a), and we expect it to be identified before the 3rd best match;4.3.Calling function CCLE_MixtureEstimate() to identify contaminant and q1 and q2. Results for our demonstrated case with (σ = 0.01, and 85/15 mixture);The possible mixture is G20469.JHOS-2.2, with proportion q2 = 82.3%, with t-stat = 210.0, p-value 0.000000e+00The identified cell line is the same as we started with, and proportion is 82.3% (or − 0.27 below the targeted 0.85 level); and5.Report estimate results in Fig. 5.As evident from Fig. 5, that the linear model regression method can correctly estimate the level of contaminator to an extent. The linear model tends to slightly under-estimate the proportion (about 3%, for both 70%/30 and 85%/15% mixtures, blue line, Fig. 5) for simulated noise σ from 0 to 6. With the increase of the s, the t stats for each proportion variable estimate decreases (2 red lines, Fig. 5), at some noise level, the proportion will over-estimate the correct level (blue lines cross zero, Fig. 5), which indicates the inability of the linear model regression to identify a correct contaminator from 934 cell-line collections (indicated by a blue circle, Fig. 5). The best case scenario would have been to show the estimation accuracy on a real mixed test dataset and we will continue to investigate the availability of such dataset.", "Methods": "MethodsCCLE datasetThe Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) is a collaborative project focused on detailed genomic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer cell lines in order to link genomic patterns with distinct pharmacologic vulnerabilities and to translate cell line integrative genomics into clinic [19, 20]. Genomic data for around 1000 cell lines are available for public access and use. To be precise, National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) legacy archive hosts RNA sequencing data for 935 cell lines, whole exome sequencing (WES) data for 326 cell lines and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for 12 cell lines (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). The names of cell lines are used as is listed in NCI GDC archive and are listed in Additional file 1. We were able to download the RNA-seq bam files for all cell lines except one cell line named ‘G27228.A101D.1’ and whole exome sequencing bam files for all 326 cell lines. These bam files were processed using our in-house pipeline for variant calling. Variant calling process included removal of duplicate reads (samtools [21] and picard [https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard]), followed by local re-alignment and re-calibration of base quality scores (GATK [22]), and finally variant calling using VarScan [23] which includes both SNP and Indels. Downstream filtering (region-based to only include exome regions, sufficient coverage, and detectable allele frequency) and all other analyses were done using in-house Perl and MATLAB scripts. No filtering based on mutation types (specific to missense, nonsense or frameshift indels) or allele types (such as bi-allelic) were applied to CCLE samples. An illustrative depiction of the overall pipeline is shown in Fig. 1a. CCLE gene expression data were collected from (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/data) and it contains RPKM values for all the genes in 1019 cell lines, covering all 935 CCLE RNA-seq set.Independent RNA-seq datasetsWe also used two publicly available RNA-seq datasets from GEO as independent test sets. First one is comprised of 12 MCF7 cell lines (GSE86316) whereas the second one has data for eight HCT116 cell lines (GSE101966) [24, 25]. These were generated to profile mRNA expression levels in MCF7 cells after silencing or chemical inhibition of MEN1 [24] and in HCT116 cells after loss of ARID1A and ARID1B [25], respectively. We downloaded the fastq files for all these samples; aligned using RSEM [26] to align all reads to UCSC hg19 transcriptome, followed by variant calling using pipeline described earlier (Fig. 1a). We purposefully used a different aligner, RSEM [26], here to check the effect of different read aligners.Correlation and hierarchical clusteringTo assess the confirmation of two cell-lines to be either identical or highly similar in terms of their sequence variation profiles genome-wide or their expression levels, we choose to use Pearson Correlation to evaluate altered allele frequencies (FREQ) across two cell-lines or expression levels, facilitated by the number of non-zero FREQ shared between two cell-lines with at least 10 fold coverage in both cell lines. We choose FREQ, instead of direct counting of altered allele depth (AD), because that majority of altered allele fractions does not change with the expression level, and allele-specific expression may appear in cell lines with certain treatments but hopefully it will be a small proportion over a typically massive number of SNPs under consideration. To be specific, for any two cell lines 〈 i, j 〉, the variants to be tested are1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ V\\in \\left\\{{V}_k,\\kern0.5em where\\kern0.5em {d}_{i,k}\\ge \\kern0.5em 10\\kern0.5em \\&\\kern0.5em {d}_{j,k}\\ge 10\\kern0.5em \\&\\kern0.5em \\left({f}_{i,k}>10\\%\\left|{f}_{j,k}>10\\%\\right.\\right)\\right\\} $$\\end{document}V∈Vkwheredi,k≥10&dj,k≥10&fi,k>10%fj,k>10%where di,k and fi,k are the depth of coverage (DP) and altered allele frequency at genomic location k of ith cell line, respectively. Note that we require variant has to exist in at least one cell line with 10 fold coverage. If a gene does not express, all mutations within this gene will not be considered unless its partner cell-line expresses this gene at a sufficient level. Therefore, the expression difference is already embedded in Pearson correlation, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ {\\rho}_{ij}={\\sigma}_{ij}^2/{\\sigma}_i{\\sigma}_j $$\\end{document}ρij=σij2/σiσj, where covariance and standard deviations will be evaluated over all variants in V. Similarly, correlations over gene expression levels between two cell lines are evaluated also by Pearson correlation coefficient, with requirement that genes with expression level > 0.1 (RPKM level) in at least one cell line. Hierarchical clustering was performed using MATLAB, using Pearson correlation of FREQ as the distance measure (over SNPs determined by Eq. 1), and with average linkage method.To determine the significance of a detected correlation coefficient for a given cell line, we generated all pair-wise correlations for 934 RNA samples, and its distribution follows normal distribution N(μ, σ). Similar distribution is also observed in pair-wise correlation from WES samples. To estimate distribution parameters, we removed correlation coefficients less than 0 (unlikely) and greater than 0.8 (most likely due to replicate and derivative cell lines in CCLE collection), therefore it forms a truncated normal density function within an interval (a, b), as follows,2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ f\\left(x;\\kern0.5em \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, b\\right)=\\frac{\\phi \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)/\\sigma }{\\left(\\Phi \\left(\\frac{b-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)-\\Phi \\left(\\frac{a-\\mu }{\\sigma}\\right)\\right)} $$\\end{document}fxμσαb=ϕx−μσ/σΦb−μσ−Φa−μσwhere we fixed cut-off a = 0, and b = 0.8. ϕ and Φ are standard normal density and distribution functions, respectively. We chose b = 0.8 as a cut-off threshold since pairs with correlation > 0.8 are derived from same parental lines or with some other biological relevance (see subsection Cell line authentication using variant comparisons in Results Section). Maximum-likelihood estimate (using MATLAB mle() function) was employed in this study, and distribution parameters from distribution (scaled to match the histogram setting) for CCLE collection were estimated. For any given correlation coefficient ρi for the test sample against ith sample in CCLE, its p = P(ρ ≥ ρij) = 1 − F(ρij; μ, σ, a, b), where F is the cumulative distribution function of Eq. 2, we consider they are possibly related if p < 0.001, and they are most likely derived from same cell origin if p < 10− 4. Multiple samples are identified as matching cells, we can revise Eq. 1 to exclude all variants that shared from these matching cells, and then repeat the process.For gene expression level, the distribution of pair-wise correlation coefficient is more skewed towards 1.0; therefore, it is difficult to separate matching cells from mismatch cells (data not shown).Contamination estimation using linear mixture modelIn addition to authenticate cells, one may also want to know whether or not the processed cells are contaminated by other cells, possibly from CCLE or additional cell lines collected in the lab, along with RNA-seq data. Assuming the test sample is a mixture of cell lines x1 and x2, with unknown proportion q1 and q2, and we denoted the mixture cell as y, or,3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ y\\sim {q}_1{x}_1+{q}_2{x}_2+e $$\\end{document}y~q1x1+q2x2+ewhere y, x1, x2 are vectors of FREQs from selected variant sites of test mixture sample and CCLE cell lines. Eq. 3 can be re-formatted into matrix Y = qX, where q = [q1, q2, …], if more than two cell mixture is hypothesized. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, our current implementation takes top 200 sites, each direction that has most difference in FREQ comparing two samples (total of 400 SNPs). To further simplify the procedure, we also use our CeL-ID to identify the dominant cell, say x1 first. Following the similar studies for de-convoluting cell type proportions [27, 28], we then test all 934 cell lines within CCLE collection, as x2, using robust linear model regression method (implemented in MATLAB fitlm() function) to estimate q1 and q2, provided q1 + q2 ≤ 1. Slightly different to typical cell-type deconvolution methods, after determining the first contaminator, we can iteratively add other candidates from the entire CCLE collection and perform linear regression, and terminate the process until q value becomes negative or regression fails (Fig. 1b).We designed a simulation procedure to evaluate the effectiveness of the robust linear model y, by the following method,4a\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ z={x}_1\\bullet N\\left({q}_1,{\\sigma}_{q_1}\\right)+{x}_2\\bullet N\\left({q}_2,{\\sigma}_{q_2}\\right) $$\\end{document}z=x1∙Nq1σq1+x2∙Nq2σq24b\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ y=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}0& N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)<0\\\\ {}N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)& 0\\le N\\left(z,{\\upsigma}_f\\right)\\le 100\\\\ {}100& N\\left(z,{\\sigma}_f\\right)>100\\end{array}\\right. $$\\end{document}y=0Nzσf<0Nzσf0≤Nzσf≤100100Nzσf>100where, in Eq. 4a, N(μ, σ) is the Gaussian noise we added to q values (vectorized to the size of number of variants, each taking a Gaussian random number with mean of q1 and q2, normalized such that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ \\frac{1}{L}\\left(N\\left({q}_1,{\\sigma}_{q_1}\\right)+N\\left({q}_2,{\\sigma}_{q_2}\\right)\\right)=1 $$\\end{document}1LNq1σq1+Nq2σq2=1 .

The genomic DNA of MAFF 305635-RFP was extracted from fungal tissue using CTAB and Qiagen Genomic-tip 500/G (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described for the 1,000 fungal genomes project (http://1000.fungalgenomes.org; last accessed on April 26, 2019). Genomic DNA was extracted from other strains using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR to detect genes on minichromosomes and highly variable effector candidate genes with presence/absence polymorphisms was performed using KOD FX Neo (Toyobo, Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers are listed in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online. Fungal strains for infection assays were grown on potato dextrose agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 24 °C for 12 h under black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions for 1 week.Genome Sequencing and AssemblyWhole genome shotgun sequences were obtained using a PacBio RSII sequencer (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). The filtered subreads (3.47-Gb, 65× average coverage) from three single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells were assembled using the RS_HGAP_Assembly.2 protocol in SMRT Analysis v2.3.0 by setting the estimated genome size to 53.4 Mb, which is the reported genome size of C. higginsianum IMI 349063 (O’Connell et al. 2012). This whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number MWPZ00000000. The version described in this article is version MWPZ01000000. To evaluate the coverage of gene-coding regions in the assembly, BUSCO v3.0.2 (Simão et al. 2015) was utilized to search Pezizomycotina universal single-copy orthologs using default settings. Additional SOLiD reads were generated from the MAFF 305635 wild-type strain (BioProject accession: PRJNA352900). Genomic DNA for preparing this library was obtained as described by Gan et al. (2013). Genomic sequencing was performed using a SOLiD3 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a 600–800-base pair (bp) insert mate-paired library with 50-bp read lengths. A total of 109,156,072 paired-reads were generated.Gene Prediction and Functional AnnotationThe BRAKER1 (Hoff et al. 2016) pipeline was utilized for gene prediction using the ab initio gene predictors Augustus-3.1.0 (Stanke et al. 2006) and GeneMark-ET v.4.30 (Lomsadze et al. 2014) with additional evidence from transcriptome data derived from IMI 349063 published by O’Connell et al. (2012) (SRR364392.sra, SRR364393.sra, RR364394.sra, SRR364395.sra, SRR364396.sra, SRR364397.sra, SRR364398.sra, SRR364399.sra, SRR364400.sra, SRR364401.sra, SRR364402.sra, SRR364403.sra, SRR364404.sra, SRR364405.sra, SRR364406.sra, SRR364407.sra, SRR364408.sra, and SRR364409.sra). RNA-seq reads were aligned to the MAFF 305635-RFP assembly using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.6 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) and TopHat2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al. 2013) with the default settings for both programs. These programs were also utilized for gene prediction. Some gene structures were manually corrected by referring to closely related fungal species. To examine the conservation of IMI 349063 minichromosome-encoded genes in MAFF 305635-RFP, reciprocal best hit analysis was performed with BlastP (cutoff E-value = 10−6) as described by Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer (2008) using all the predicted protein sequences from both strains. Only MAFF 305635-RFP proteins that were reciprocal best hits of proteins encoded by genes located on the minichromosomes of IMI 349063 were considered as potential homologs of minichromosome genes.Whole-Genome AlignmentsWhole-genome alignments were performed with nucmer in MUMmer 3.23 (Kurtz et al. 2004) using –mumreference (default settings). To remove spurious hits, the alignments were subsequently filtered by length, retaining alignments with ≥99% identity and ≥15 kb referring to Faino et al. (2016). Shared genomic regions were calculated after combining overlaps in aligned regions using BEDTools version 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the merge option. Strain-specific regions were defined as genomic regions that were not aligned to the other genome after filtering. To confirm large-scale rearrangements, PacBio and SOLiD reads were mapped using SMRT analysis v2.3.0 and CLC Genomics Workbench8 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark), respectively, using the default settings for both programs and visually examined using Integrated Genome Browser 9.0.1 (Freese et al. 2016). Whole-genome alignments were also performed in three additional fungal pathogenic fungi, V.dahliae (VdLs17 and JR2) (Faino et al. 2015), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (4287 and D11) (Ayhan et al. 2018), and M.oryzae (BTJP4-1 and BR32) (Win et al. 2019). Mapping analysis using Illumina MiSeq reads derived from MAFF 305635 wild-type (CK7444), vir-49, and vir-51 generated by Plaumann et al. (2018) (.fastq accessions: SAMN08226879, SAMN08226880, and SAMN08226881) was performed using Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) with default settings.Prediction of Transposable ElementsTransposable elements (TEs) were predicted as described by Castanera et al. (2016). TEs in the two C. higginsianum genome assemblies were predicted using RECON version 1.08 (Bao and Eddy 2002), RepeatScout version 1.0.5 (Price et al. 2005) (integrated into the RepeatModeler pipeline), and LTRharvest from GenomeTools-1.5.9 (Ellinghaus et al. 2008) with default settings for all programs. The results from LTRharvest were used as queries for BlastN (cutoff E-value = 10−15) against the genome assembly and for BlastX (cutoff E-value = 10−5) against the Repbase peptide database (downloaded on February 1, 2014) (Bao et al. 2015). Only sequences longer than 400 bp with more than five copies or yielding a significant hit to the described sequences in Repbase were further analyzed. The outputs from the genome assemblies of the two strains using the three programs were merged and identical sequences were eliminated using USEARCH v9.1.13 (Edgar 2010) with the -fastx_uniques option. The obtained sequences were clustered at 80% similarity using USEARCH v9.1.13 with the -cluster_smallmem option to create a custom TE library. Consensus sequences in the library were classified using BlastX (cutoff E-value = 10−5) against the Repbase peptide database, and the final libraries were used as input for RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org; last accessed on November 25, 2016). Consensus sequences without similarity to any Repbase entry were removed from the library. RepeatMasker outputs were parsed using the One_code_to_find_them_all version 1.0 (Bailly-Bechet et al. 2014) to reconstruct TE fragments into full-length copies. Among the reconstructed fragments of TEs, those longer than 400 bp were used for analysis. To perform Monte Carlo tests, 1,000 trials to model TEs randomly located on the genome were generated using BEDTools version 2.25.0 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the shuffle -noOverlapping option. Overlap between TEs and strain-specific regions were calculated using BEDTools version 2.25.0 with the coverage option. As the default settings of nucmer ignores nonunique sequences in the reference, to analyze regions regardless of their uniqueness in the reference strain, we repeated nucmer with the –maxmatch settings and redefined strain-specific regions. Then, Monte Carlo tests were repeated as described above.Analysis of Genome CompartmentalizationFlanking intergenic regions (FIRs) were calculated using R scripts as described by Saunders et al. (2014). Two-dimensional plots were created by referring to Frantzeskakis et al. (2018). Distances from genes to the nearest TEs were calculated using BEDTools version 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with the closest -D a -iu -a or -D a -id -a option. Fungal universal single-copy orthologs in the two strains were identified as the best hits from BlastP (cutoff E-value = 10−5) results using fungi_odb9 sequences provided in BUSCO v3.0.2 (Simão et al. 2015) as queries and C. higginsianum predicted proteomes as references. For synteny analysis, Easyfig 2.2.2 (Sullivan et al. 2011) was used with an identity cutoff of 70%.Comparative Secretome AnalysisTo predict secreted proteins, SignalP 4.1 (Petersen et al. 2011), TMHMM 2.0 (Krogh et al. 2001), and big-PI Fungal Predictor (Eisenhaber et al. 2004) were used with the default settings. In this study, effector candidate proteins were defined as predicted secreted proteins (with a signal peptide present but no transmembrane domains and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchors) with lengths of <300 amino acids. To assess the overlap between effectors predicted with our pipeline and those predicted by the effector prediction programs EffectorP 1.0 and 2.0 (Sperschneider et al. 2016, 2018), we ran both versions of EffectorP using the default settings. To examine whether effector candidates show similarity to known proteins, BlastP analysis using the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded at October 22, 2016) was performed (cutoff E-value = 10−5). To detect variations in effector candidates, the protein sequences of effector candidates from each strain were queried against the genome assembly of the other strain using exonerate version 2.2.0 (Slater and Birney 2005) with the protein2genome option. Query coverage values of homologous sequences were calculated by reciprocally performing BlastP between effector candidates and exonerate-predicted protein sequences. The results were inspected and manually corrected. A dendrogram based on the presence/absence patterns of highly variable effector candidate genes was drawn using the R package heatmap.2 from gplots v3.0.1.Conservation Patterns of Highly Variable Effector Candidate GenesThe details of the genome and proteome sequences of 25 ascomycetes used in this analysis are shown in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online. To identify orthogroups containing highly variable effector candidates among the 25 ascomycetes, orthoMCL v2.0.9 (Li et al. 2003) was used with an E-value = 10−5 as the threshold and inflation value of 1.5. The alignment of CH35J_007515, CH35J_007516, and their homologs was generated using protein sequences with their predicted signal peptides removed. Sequence alignments were performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench8 (CLC bio).Phylogenetic AnalysesThe phylogenetic tree to classify 16 C. higginsianum strains was generated based on the combined alignments of actin (ACT), chitin synthase I (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone H3 (HIS3), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and tubulin-2 (TUB2). This tree was drawn using previously identified sequences from other species in the Colletotrichumdestructivum complex (Damm et al. 2014). The DNA sequences of 16 strains were determined by direct Sanger sequencing of PCR products amplified with KOD -Plus- Neo (Toyobo) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers are listed in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online. The phylogenetic tree of 25 ascomycetes was generated based on the combined alignments of single gene orthogroups conserved in all 25 ascomycetes obtained from the orthoMCL results. For both trees, DNA or protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7.215 (Katoh et al. 2002) with the auto setting and trimmed using trimAL v1.2 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009) with the automated1 settings. The concatenated trimmed alignments were then utilized to estimate the maximum-likelihood species phylogeny with RAxML version 8.2.11 (Stamatakis 2014) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To generate the maximum-likelihood tree of species in the C. destructivum complex, the GTRCAT model was used. To generate the maximum-likelihood tree of 25 ascomycetes, PROTGAMMAAUTO was used to find the best protein substitution model and autoMRE was used to determine the appropriate number of bootstrap samples. Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences were used as the outgroup in this tree. Trees were visualized using iTOL version 4.1 (Letunic and Bork 2016).Infection AssaysPlants were grown at 22 °C with a 10-h photoperiod for 4 weeks. Three leaves per plant were inoculated with 5-μl droplets of conidial suspensions at 5 × 105 conidia ml−1. Plants were maintained at 22 °C with a 10-h photoperiod under 100% humidity conditions after inoculation. The symptoms were observed at 6 days after inoculation and lesion areas were measured using the color threshold function in ImageJ 1.51k (Schneider et al. 2012) using the following settings: Hue, 0–255; saturation, 110–140; and brightness, 0–255 with a square region of interest.", "Results": "ResultsGenome Assembly of C. higginsianum Isolated from JapanThe genome of C. higginsianum MAFF 305635-RFP was sequenced using a PacBio RSII sequencer. Filtered subreads were assembled using a hierarchical genome-assembly process (Chin et al. 2013). The genome assembly contained 28 contigs with a total length of 49.8 Mb (N50 = 5.06 and L50 = 5) (table 1). The completeness of the assembly was evaluated by searching Pezizomycotina universal single-copy orthologs using BUSCO (Simão et al. 2015). This analysis estimated that the assembly included 99.0% complete/0.3% partial assessed loci, indicating that the assembly covered most gene-coding regions. A total of 12,915 protein-coding genes were predicted in the assembly, which was comparable to other closely related Colletotrichum fungi, such as C. graminicola M1.001, C. incanum MAFF 238712, and C. higginsianum IMI 349063 possessing 12,006, 11,852, and 14,651 protein-coding genes, respectively (O’Connell et al. 2012; Gan et al. 2016; Zampounis et al. 2016).Extensive Genomic Variations between C. higginsianum StrainsTo examine genomic differences between the two sequenced strains of C. higginsianum, whole-genome alignments were performed following Faino et al. (2016) (fig. 1) . The two strains shared 88.2% in MAFF 305635-RFP and 86.6% in IMI 349063 of their total contig lengths (≥99% identity, ≥15 kb). The percentages of shared genomic regions are comparable to other plant pathogenic fungi, such as V.dahliae (93.2% in VdLs17; 92.8% in JR2), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (93.3% in 4287; 86.0% in D11), and M.oryzae (75.9% in BTJP4-1; 81.4% in BR32) when the same cutoffs were applied (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). Whole-genome alignments also revealed that the two C. higginsianum strains contained strain-specific regions (<99% identity, <15 kb) with lower sequence similarity compared with the other strain (11.8% in MAFF 305635-RFP and 13.4% in IMI 349063 of the total genomes). It is noted that the amounts of strain-specific regions increase when more stringent cutoffs were applied on whole-genome alignments (supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). Whole-genome alignments also detected 19 synteny breakpoints resulting in large-scale genomic rearrangements between the two strains. The 19 synteny breakpoints included ten large-scale rearrangements between the two strains including six interchromosomal translocations and four intrachromosomal inversions. Remapping of the PacBio reads derived from MAFF 305635-RFP and SOLiD reads derived from MAFF 305635 wild-type to the genome assembly of IMI 349063 confirmed that at least 11 of these sites were not caused by misassembly and are present in the wild-type strain (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). In addition, mapping of SOLiD reads derived from MAFF 305635 wild-type to the genome assembly of MAFF 305635-RFP also indicated that the RFP expression cassette was inserted into the genome without causing a rearrangement (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online).Notably, chromosomes 11 and 12, which are known as minichromosomes in IMI 349063, were the two largest strain-specific regions. Indeed, only 19 of 271 genes on the minichromosomes of IMI 349063 showed reciprocal best hits in MAFF 305635-RFP (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Recently, Plaumann et al. (2018) reported that MAFF 305635 also contains two minichromosomes, chromosomes 11 and 12. The same study identified vir-49 and vir-51 as MAFF 305635-derived virulence mutants lacking chromosome 11. Mapping of the Illumina MiSeq reads derived from MAFF 305635 wild-type (CK7444), vir-49, and vir-51 from their study to the genome assembly of MAFF 305635-RFP revealed that no contigs showed reduced read coverage per gene compared with the average coverage of all genes (supplementary fig. S5, Supplementary Material online). To confirm the presence or absence of chromosomes 11 and 12 in MAFF 305635-RFP, PCR was also performed using the primer sets described by Plaumann et al. (2018) and newly designed primer sets to amplify selected genes from chromosome 12 of IMI 349063. PCR products were not detected in MAFF 305635-RFP with any primer sets designed to amplify genes on the minichromosomes whereas PCR products were detected in MAFF 305635 wild-type (supplementary fig. S6, Supplementary Material online). Taken together, these results suggest that MAFF 305635-RFP lacks the minichromosomes reported in MAFF 305635 wild-type (CK7444) used by Plaumann et al. (2018).Association between Genomic Variations and TEs in C. higginsianumTEs are known to contribute to the generation of genomic variations. Thus, we predicted that TEs are a driving force in generating genomic variations in C. higginsianum in the absence of meiosis. To test this hypothesis, the TEs of C. higginsianum were predicted de novo using the pipeline described by Castanera et al. (2016). The genome coverage of TEs was estimated to be 4.6% and 5.1% in MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063, respectively. Both assemblies contained several shorter contigs or chromosomes with higher TE coverage compared with the rest of the genome (supplementary fig. S7, Supplementary Material online). Notably, in IMI 349063, the two minichromosomes showed higher TE coverage (37.3% in chromosome 11 and 21.2% in chromosome 12). Predicted TEs were classified into four types: Copia, Gypsy, and Tad1 from Class I TEs and TcMar-Fot1 from Class II TEs. Among the four types of TEs, TcMar-Fot1 showed the highest genome coverage in both strains (3.49% in MAFF 305635-RFP and 4.23% in IMI 349063) (supplementary fig. S8, Supplementary Material online).The association between genomic variations and TEs was assessed (fig. 2A and supplementary fig. S9, Supplementary Material online). The results showed that eight of ten large-scale rearrangements were within 10 kb of the nearest TE in MAFF 305635-RFP (fig. 2B and supplementary fig. S10, Supplementary Material online). Additionally, 29.5% and 29.8% of strain-specific regions were occupied by TEs in MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063, respectively. This rate is significantly higher than if the TEs were randomly distributed in both genomes (highest coverage in 1,000 trials = 7.5% and 7.2% in MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063, respectively, P = 0.001, Monte Carlo test) (supplementary fig. S11, Supplementary Material online). In this study, we defined strain-specific regions using the default settings of the genome alignment program nucmer, which only considers matches of sequences that are unique in the reference. However, this may result in repeat sequences being overrepresented as strain-specific regions. Therefore, we repeated nucmer with different settings to include sequences that are not unique in the reference as well. In this case, we found that 19.2% in MAFF 305635-RFP and 25.1% in IMI 349063 of strain-specific regions were occupied by TEs, indicating that these rates are still significantly higher than random chance in both genomes (P < 0.001, Monte Carlo test) (supplementary fig. S11, Supplementary Material online). Compartmentalization of Effector Candidate and Housekeeping Genes in the C. higginsianum GenomeTo determine whether the C. higginsianum genome contains regions enriched with effector genes, we predicted the effector candidates of C. higginsianum. Proteins were classified as effector candidates if they were predicted to be secreted proteins with lengths of <300 amino acids. This analysis revealed that both C. higginsianum strains have a similar number of effector candidates (582 in MAFF 305635-RFP and 576 in IMI 349063). Using version 1.0 or 2.0 of the effector prediction program EffectorP (Sperschneider et al. 2016, 2018), 378 (64.9%) in MAFF 305635-RFP and 353 (61.3%) in IMI 349063 proteins were also predicted as effector candidates (supplementary tables S6 and S7, Supplementary Material online). BlastP analysis using the Swiss-Prot database (cutoff E-value = 10−5) revealed that 428 (73.5%) and 427 (74.1%) effector candidates in MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063, respectively, are of unknown function (supplementary fig. S12, Supplementary Material online).Next, we assessed the FIRs of effector candidate genes, fungal universal single-copy orthologs, and randomly sampled genes excluding these two classes to determine if these genes are in gene-dense or gene-poor genomic regions. The distributions of FIRs are significantly different between effector candidate genes, randomly sampled genes, and fungal universal single-copy orthologs in both strains (Wilcoxon rank sum test with adjustment by Holm’s method) (fig. 3A and supplementary fig. S13A, Supplementary Material online). Two-dimensional plots describing 5′ and 3′ FIRs also indicated that fungal universal single-copy orthologs tended to be closer to flanking neighboring genes, whereas effector candidate genes were further apart from their nearest gene neighbors (supplementary fig. S14, Supplementary Material online). The distances between the three categories of genes and their nearest TEs were also investigated. The distributions of distances from the nearest TEs are significantly different between all pair-wise combinations of the three categories (Wilcoxon rank sum test with adjustment by Holm’s method) (fig. 3B and supplementary fig. S13B, Supplementary Material online). In both strains, the median distances between effector candidate genes and their neighboring TEs are lower than the median distances between fungal universal single-copy orthologs or randomly sampled genes and their closest TEs. Variations in Effector Candidate Genes between C. higginsianum StrainsTo provide insight into the adaptative evolution of C. higginsianum effectors, variations in effector candidates were investigated (fig. 4A and supplementary tables S6 and S7, Supplementary Material online). To eliminate predicted gene variations related to differences in the annotation programs used, protein sequences of effector candidates from each strain were queried against the genome assembly of the other strain. Based on this analysis, 474 (81.4%) and 469 (80.6%) effector candidates in MAFF 305635-RFP and in IMI 349063 were identical in the other strain, indicating that the two strains generally contain a similar repertoire of effector candidates. However, 8 (1.37%) MAFF 305635-RFP and 18 (3.09%) IMI 349063 candidates were highly variable between the two strains, defined here as having ≤90% query coverage. Among them, ten candidates were detected as presence/absence polymorphisms and seven candidates showed lower query coverages because of frameshifts (supplementary table S8, Supplementary Material online). A total of 100 (17.2%) MAFF 305635-RFP and 89 (15.3%) IMI 349063 effector candidates were also polymorphic (containing at least one nonsynonymous substitution and >90% query coverage). To examine whether these genes varied from those in other strains of C. higginsianum, ten highly variable effector candidate genes with presence/absence polymorphisms were assessed by PCR in 16 C. higginsianum strains isolated from different geographic locations, including MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063 (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Molecular phylogenetic analysis, using all available sequences from strains from the C. destructivum species complex described by Damm et al. (2014), confirmed that all 16 strains were classified as C. higginsianum (supplementary figure S15, Supplementary Material online). Amplification of these effector candidate genes by PCR revealed that their conservation patterns varied within other strains as well (fig. 4B and supplementary fig. S16, Supplementary Material online). Nine strains isolated in Japan showed different patterns for the presence/absence of these genes. Notably, we found that MAFF 305635 wild-type has four of five highly variable effector candidate genes that were absent in MAFF 305635-RFP. In contrast, three strains from Trinidad and Tobago showed the same presence/absence patterns. In addition, we tested a strain subcultured from IMI 349063 that has lower conidia production rates than MAFF 305635-RFP and that causes less severe infection symptoms than MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063 (supplementary fig. S17, Supplementary Material online). The results showed that this strain appears to lack chromosome 12, as no PCR bands were detected in all tested genes in chromosome 12 (supplementary figs. S16 and S18, Supplementary Material online). Thus, this strain was named IMI 349063Δ.Conservation of Highly Variable C. higginsianum Effector Candidate GenesTo explore the potential mechanisms of how C. higginsianum acquired highly variable effector candidate genes, we investigated the conservation patterns of these genes amongst 25 ascomycetes (fig. 5 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). The results showed that CH35J_003318 from MAFF 305635-RFP and CH63R_09232, CH63R_09755, CH63R_14384, CH63R_14389, CH63R_14470, and CH63R_14558 from IMI 349063 were found only in either of the two strains among the tested ascomycetes. In contrast, CH35J_011924 and CH35J_002132 from MAFF 305635-RFP and CH63R_14516, CH63R_05497, CH63R_04687, and CH63R_06433 from IMI 349063 were relatively conserved in Ascomycota but absent from MAFF 305635-RFP or IMI 349063. The remaining highly variable effector candidate genes showed uneven conservation patterns that did not follow the species’ phylogenetic relationships. Among them, CH35J_007515 and CH35J_007516 were found to be paralogs based on OrthoMCL analysis. Interestingly, the paralogs showed high similarities to proteins found only in Bipolaris maydis as shown in figure 5. Querying the protein sequences of the paralogs against the NCBI nucleotide collection revealed that only Bipolarismaydis, Bipolarisoryzae, Bipolarisvictoriae, Bipolariszeicola, Bipolarissorokiniana, Aspergillus novofumigatus, and Aspergillusterreus have similar sequences (TBlastN, E-value ≤2 × 10−28) (supplementary fig. S19, Supplementary Material online). Synteny of Genomic Regions Encoding Highly Variable Effector CandidatesTo investigate the associations between effector candidate genes and TEs, synteny analysis of genomic regions containing highly variable effector candidate genes was performed (fig. 6 and supplementary fig. S20, Supplementary Material online). Syntenic regions containing 17 of 26 highly variable effector candidate genes were reconstructed. We found that eight (six in MAFF 305635-RFP and two in IMI 349063) of 17 such genes were in synteny-disrupted regions associated with TEs. However, nine highly variable effector candidate genes were not associated with synteny-disrupted regions (two in MAFF 305635-RFP and seven in IMI 349063). Notably, seven of these effector candidate genes (two in MAFF 305635-RFP and five in IMI 349063) were highly variable because of frameshifts. No syntenic region was identified for the remaining nine highly variable effector candidate genes. These genes in the two minichromosomes of IMI 349063 and syntenic regions could not be reconstructed because of the loss of minichromosomes in MAFF 305635-RFP. Interestingly, in IMI 349063, 9 of the 18 highly variable effector candidate genes were in its two minichromosomes. Of these, five genes were completely absent from MAFF 305635-RFP. However, despite the lack of minichromosomes, related sequences were identified for four of these genes in MAFF 305635-RFP (supplementary table S9, Supplementary Material online).Both Sequenced C. higginsianum Strains Showed Similar Virulence Levels toward A. thaliana Ecotypes Ws-2 and Ler-0To examine the impact of the genetic differences observed between the two sequenced isolates, we assessed the ability of both strains to cause lesions on A. thaliana ecotypes Ws-2 and Ler-0. A previous report showed that Ws-2 and Ler-0 were resistant and susceptible, respectively, to C. higginsianum IMI 349061 (Birker et al. 2009). To quantify these differences in pathogenicity, lesion areas caused by MAFF 305635-RFP and IMI 349063 were measured on Ws-2 and Ler-0. Both strains showed significantly larger lesions on Ler-0 compared with Ws-2. However, no significant differences were detected between the strains (supplementary figs. S21 and S22, Supplementary Material online)."}, "stats": {"Materials and Methods": {"chars": 12911, "tokens": 1843, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 16379, "tokens": 2353, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Genome Biology and Evolution", "year": "2019", "doi": "10.1093/gbe/evz087", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Margate, UK) ages 10–12 weeks (22–26 g) were used (n = 132 in total) for all protocols.In vitro production and labelling of MVsTo provide a defined, inflammation-relevant and abundant source of MVs for in vivo tracking studies in mice, we used the semi-adherent J774A.1 macrophage cell line (ECACC, UK: ECACC-91051511) which produces EVs rapidly in response to extracellular ATP stimulation via the P2X7 receptor signalling pathway [26]. Activation of the P2X7 receptor by a typical danger signal ATP is a potent stimulus for MV release and is central to the development of sterile and infectious inflammation and tissue injury [31]. Confluent cells in 60 mm tissue culture dishes were rinsed multiple times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, with calcium and magnesium) to remove any cellular debris and EVs, and then stimulated for 30 min, with 3 mM ATP (Bio-Techne, UK) in PBS at 37°C. Although more prolonged exposure (>2 h) to ATP at this concentration can produce non-apoptotic cytotoxicity in J774 cells [32], and other cell types [33], viability was high (>90%) in cells harvested from plates after this brief ATP stimulation, in agreement with the previous study [32]. Released EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation in an Eppendorf angle rotor (FA45-30-11) microfuge at 300 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet cells, followed by medium speed centrifugation of the supernatant at 20,800 × g at 4°C for 15 min to enrich MVs in pellets. EV preparations were labelled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK), a lipophilic, far-red fluorescent dye previously used in in vivo and in vitro EV uptake studies [34–36] The pellet was resuspended with PBS, 0.5% clinical-grade human albumin solution (HAS) and incubated at room temperature with DiD, prediluted (30 µM) in Diluent C (Sigma), at a final concentration 5 µM for 7 min. The mixture was then further diluted with PBS-HAS and washed twice by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 15 min) with careful removal of supernatant to remove unbound DiD. MV-specific DiD staining was assessed by flow cytometry in combination with plasma membrane markers and comparison to typical exosome markers. To assess levels of MV incorporated DiD versus unbound DiD, labelled and washed preparations were incubated with anti-CD11b immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 1 × 108 DiD/CD45/CD11b-positive events per 50 µl of microbeads for 30 min at 4°C. Application to magnetized LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) was followed by collection of unbound flow-through and column-bound fractions. DiD fluorescence was measured in PBS, Triton X-100 (0.5%) at 635 nm/680 nm excitation/emission in a Biotek FLx800 plate reader.LiposomesLiposomes were supplied by Encapsula NanoSciences (Brentwood, TN, USA) as phosphatidylcholine only (PC-liposomes) and phosphatidylcholine and PS at a 1:1 molar ratio (“PS-liposomes”) sized to 100 nm using high-pressure argon extrusion. DiD labelling of PS-liposomes for in vivo experiments was performed as for MVs.In vivo model of subclinical endotoxemia and MV challengeSub-clinical endotoxemia was induced by single, low-dose LPS (20 ng, Ultrapure Escherichia coli O111:B4; InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) i.v. injection [21]. For determination of MV uptake, a standardized dose of DiD-labelled MVs (2.4 × 105 fluorescence units/200 µl, equivalent to a count of ~1.0 × 108 MVs) suspended in PBS was injected i.v. via the tail vein to either untreated or LPS-pretreated mice. After 1 h, mice were anesthetized, heparinized and exsanguinated, before rapid excision and processing of total lung and spleen, and a weighed portion of the liver, for flow cytometric analysis.Macrophage depletion in vivoIntravascular-resident macrophages and monocytes were depleted by i.v. injection of 0.2 ml of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA). MV challenge experiments were performed after 72 h when vascular Ly6Chigh monocytes were repopulated from the bone marrow reservoir but before significant restoration of blood Ly6Clow monocytes [21,37,38], or liver and splenic macrophages (Supplementary Figure S1) [39,40].Isolated perfused lung (IPL)For assessing pulmonary intravascular uptake of MVs in isolation from the systemic circulation, mouse IPL was performed as described by us in recent publications [41,42]. In brief, untreated or low-dose LPS pretreated (i.v., 20 ng, 2 h) mice were injected i.p. with xylaxine (13 mg/kg)/ketamine (130 mg/kg) to induce general anaesthesia, injected i.v. via a tail vein with 20 IU of heparin, and the trachea intubated and connected to the ventilator on continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H2O. After exsanguination via the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary artery and left atrium were cannulated and perfusion performed with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 4% clinical-grade human albumin solution at a slow rate of 0.1 ml/min increasing gradually to a constant flow rate of 25 ml/kg/min with an open, non-recirculating circuit to remove blood and loosely marginated cells in a total perfusate volume of 3 ml. Perfusion was then switched to the closed, recirculating circuit (volume 2.5 ml) and the same fluorescence-standardized dose of MVs as used in vivo was infused via the perfusion circuit reservoir and recirculated for 1 h.In vitro MV uptake assayMechanisms of MV uptake were investigated in vitro using leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation as the most anatomically relevant and abundant source, contrasting with blood where monocytopenia severely limits cell recovery during endotoxemia. Following terminal anaesthesia and heparinization, inflated lungs were perfused with HBSS (without Ca2+/Mg2+)-albumin (4%) via the pulmonary artery at a high constant flow of 50 ml/h for 12 min for maximal recovery of blood and marginated cells from the left atrium. Based on preliminary evaluations of MV uptake (Supplementary Figure S2), in vitro incubations of MVs with washed perfusate cells were performed at standardized density of 5 × 104 Ly6Chigh monocytes/ml in HBBS-HAS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) in Eppendorfs with continuous mixing for 1 h.Flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions were prepared from excised tissue as described previously [43] with minor modifications. Tissues were disaggregated in formaldehyde fixative in MACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) with a gentleMACS™ Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Ltd., Bisley, UK) for 1 min. For cell counts, ice-cold flow cytometry wash buffer (PBS, 2% FCS, 0.1 mM sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA) was added directly to suspensions, or for DiD detection, after a further 5 min fixation at room temperature. This method of combining rapid tissue disaggregation and cell dispersal with simultaneous fixation aimed to minimize any MV binding and internalization at the point of tissue harvest, contrasting with standard enzyme-based tissue disaggregation methods that require relatively prolonged incubations at 37°C. For quantification of cell surface receptor expression, single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzyme digestion with collagenase A (1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNAse1 (0.1 mg/ml, Roche) at 37°C for 20 min. Cell suspensions were sieved through a 40 µm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-One, UK) and washed prior to antibody staining. The following specificity fluorophore-conjugated rat anti-mouse (unless stated otherwise) mAbs were used: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (BM8), Ly-6G (1A8), Ly-6C (HK1.4), NK-1.1 (PK136), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), CD31 (MEC13.3), CD41 (MWReg30), MerTK (2B10C42), TIM4 (RMT4-54), CD51 (RMV-7), CD9 (MZ3), CD63 (NVG-2), LAMP2 (M3/84), hamster anti-CD61 (HMβ3-1), CD68 (FA-11), CD36 (HM36), CD81 (Eat-2) all from Biolegend (London, UK); human anti-CD204 (REA148) from Miltenyi Biotec Ltd.; and anti-MARCO (ED31) from Bio-Rad (Watford, UK). Gating strategies for intravascular monocyte subsets and neutrophils were based on CD11b, Ly6G, Ly6C, F4/80, MHCII, NK1.1 staining as previously described [41,43,44]. Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages were identified as CD45+, CD11b-low/med and F4/80+ [45] (Supplementary Figure S1) and endothelial cells as CD31-positive and CD41/CD45-negative [22]. Cell counts were determined using Accucheck counting beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were acquired using a Cyan ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), with EV events acquired using a side scatter trigger threshold. Analysis of data was performed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). MV uptake for each cell population was quantified as cell-associated DiD mean (geometric) fluorescence intensity (MFI). Total MV uptake per organ was calculated as: [cell-associated DiD MFI for each mouse – group mean background fluorescence (untreated mice) MFI] × group mean cell count/organ.Confocal microscopyCell suspensions were treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (Miltenyi Biotech Ltd.) and leukocytes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Washed cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Ly6C biotin-conjugated mAb (clone HK1.4, BioLegend) at 4°C overnight, followed by Alexa Fluor-488 streptavidin (BioLegend) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were cytospin-centrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides (Sigma) and mounted with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope, with Zeiss KS-300 software and analysed using FIJI software.Data analysisNormality was determined using QQ plots and Shapiro–Wilk tests using IBM SPSS 25 software. Group comparisons were made by Student’s t-tests, by ANOVA with Bonferroni tests, or by Friedman with Dunn’s tests, using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Data are presented as mean ± SD or median with interquartile ranges (median ± IQR). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.", "Results": "ResultsProduction and characterization of fluorescently labelled J774-derived EVsEVs were generated in vitro from the mouse macrophage J774 cell line via ATP stimulation of the P2X7 receptor inflammatory signalling pathway [26]. Cell-depleted supernatants were centrifuged at medium speed (20,800 × g) for MV enrichment and labelled with DiD. Flow cytometric analysis indicated the majority of DiD-positive events were <1 µm (Figure 1(a)) and therefore unlikely to be apoptotic bodies [46]. Expression of plasma membrane surface markers, CD11b and CD45 (Figure 1(b)) on EVs was consistent with the “right-side-out” membrane orientation of MVs from myeloid cells [1]. Staining of the DiD-labelled EVs for previously described exosome markers, the tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 [47], and the lysosome-associated membrane protein, LAMP2 [48] indicated that although CD9, CD81 and LAMP2 were clearly detectable on EVs they were also expressed at high levels on the plasma membrane of untreated parent J774 cells. By contrast, surface CD63 was absent from both EVs and cells. Similarities between expression profiles of tetraspanins on EVs and the parental cell membrane have been described previously in other cell lines [49]. Finally, staining with annexin V indicated exposure of the membrane phospholipid, PS, a more generic marker of MVs [50] than of exosomes [51]. Similar marker profiles were observed on EVs released from LPS-stimulated J774s (Supplementary Figure S3), but this method of production required longer incubation times (≥4 h) for significant EV yield, increasing the likelihood of apoptotic body formation.To further characterize the preparation, we quantified the amount of DiD fluorescence associated with the CD11b-positive EV fraction by binding to anti-CD11b immunomagnetic microbeads. The majority of DiD fluorescence was associated with the column-bound and eluted CD11b microbead fraction (Figure 1(c)), with only a minor fraction remaining unbound in the column flow-through. Based on these analyses and the steps taken to reduce apoptotic body formation (brief stimulation period) and exosome recovery (medium centrifugation speed), we concluded that the DiD-labelled material prepared for uptake experiments was enriched with “MVs” as defined as plasma membrane-derived EVs [46,52].In vivo uptake of circulating MVs during low-grade systemic inflammationTo assess in vivo cell- and organ-specific uptake of exogenously administered MVs in mice under inflamed or diseased states, we used low-dose LPS i.v. injection to induce a sub-acute, systemic intravascular inflammation. We have previously shown that such subclinical endotoxemia produces a marked expansion of the marginated pool of monocytes within the pulmonary microvasculature that were functionally primed towards secondary stimuli [21]. Freshly generated J774 MVs were DiD fluorescence-labelled and injected i.v. into untreated or LPS-pretreated (2 h) mice, and cell-associated DiD fluorescence in the lungs, liver and spleen quantified by flow cytometry (Figure 2).In normal mice, MV uptake was highest in the liver Kupffer cells (Figure 2(c)), consistent with a previous study assessing uptake of i.v.-injected erythrocyte-derived MVs [14]. Significant, but lower-level MV uptake was also observed in other resident intravascular cell populations: hepatic endothelial cells and splenic macrophages. In the lungs, where significant numbers of marginated monocytes and neutrophils are already present under baseline conditions [41,44], MV uptake was evident in both monocyte subsets (Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow), but not in neutrophils, pulmonary endothelial cells, or alveolar macrophages (Figure 2(a,b)). Alveolar macrophages were analysed as an extravascular phagocytic population not exposed directly to circulating MVs in vivo, and therefore their complete lack of DiD staining ruled out the possibility of any artefactual uptake of MVs/DiD by all cells with the rapid, non-enzymatic method of tissue disaggregation and fixation used here. Following low-dose LPS injection, MV uptake increased in both monocyte subsets in all organs, but this was most pronounced in lung-marginated Ly6Chigh monocytes. Low-level MV uptake by neutrophils was also detectable in the lungs and spleen. Unexpectedly, MV uptake by liver Kupffer cells was decreased by ~50% (p < 0.001) during endotoxemia (Figure 2(c)).Cell numbers in tissue single-cell suspensions were determined in a separate group of mice to assess the net contribution of each cell population within each organ to MV uptake under normal and LPS-treated conditions (Figure 3). At 2 h post-LPS, prior to injection of MVs, substantial increases in Ly6Chigh monocyte numbers occurred in the lungs and liver but not in the spleen (Figure 3(a–c)). In the exsanguinated blood (Supplementary Figure S4), only a fraction of the monocytes found in organs were present, whereas neutrophil numbers increased in all organs and blood. Estimation of cellular MV uptake per organ (cell-associated DiD MFI in Figure 1(a–c) × cell count/organ in Figure 3(a–c); see methods) indicated a clear and dramatic increase (>20-fold) in the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 3(d)), attributable almost solely to the marginated Ly6Chigh monocyte pool. Reduced MV uptake by Kupffer cells during endotoxemia translated into reduced liver uptake overall, despite an increased contribution from Ly6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils (Figure 3(e)). In the spleen, total MV uptake increased moderately during systemic inflammation due to increased monocyte and neutrophil uptake (Figure 3(f)), but with no change in resident macrophage uptake.MV uptake by lung-marginated monocytes vs. intravascular macrophagesThe inverse effects of endotoxemia on MV uptake by Ly6Chigh monocytes and Kupffer cells suggested a dynamic and reciprocal relationship, with the potential for competition between the two cell populations. To elucidate this relationship, we performed MV challenge experiments in mice pretreated with clodronate-liposomes. This treatment initially depletes all intravascular mononuclear phagocytes including monocytes, but after 72 h intravascular Ly6Chigh monocytes are re-populated by a newly differentiated population from the bone marrow reserve whereas Ly6Clow monocytes and intravascular macrophages (Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages) remain depleted (Figure 4(a), Supplementary Figure S1) [21,37–40]. In clodronate-pretreated mice, in which higher levels of MVs remained present in plasma 1 h after injection (Figure 4(b); Supplementary Figure S5), there was a substantial increase in MV uptake by lung-marginated Ly6Chigh monocytes compared to normal mice (Figure 4(c)). These data suggest that marginated monocytes can uptake more MVs when they are exposed to higher circulating MV levels. Subclinical endotoxemia in these macrophage-depleted mice induced a further increase in MV uptake by lung-marginated Ly6Chigh monocytes (MFI: 476 ± 116), even exceeding the level observed in Kupffer cells in both normal and LPS-challenged mice (MFI: 350 ± 100 and 166 ± 60, Figure 1(a)), indicating that MV uptake capacity of these monocytes per se is substantively enhanced in response to inflammatory stimuli. The combination of macrophage depletion with endotoxemia also produced significant increases in MV uptake by endothelial cells within the lungs, higher than in normal mice (Figure 1(a)), further demonstrating the importance of “MV availability” in the regulation of MV uptake by intravascular cells.MV uptake in isolated perfused lungs ex vivoNext, we performed pulmonary vascular MV uptake experiments using our established isolated perfused lung (IPL) system [41,42], as a novel approach to analyse organ-specific MV uptake by which all systemic variables are eliminated, including potential non-specific effects of the intravascular macrophage depletion procedure. Lungs from normal untreated or low-dose LPS-challenged mice were flushed briefly at low flow rates to remove only the residual blood and loosely marginated blood cells [41], followed by infusion of DiD-labelled J774-derived MVs and recirculating lung perfusion (using serum-free buffer, under mechanical ventilation for 1 h). Cell-associated DiD fluorescence analysed in lung cell suspensions (Figure 5) indicated that MV uptake was almost exclusive to Ly6Chigh monocytes and clearly higher in lungs from endotoxemic mice, confirming the direct effects of inflammation on the MV uptake capacity of these monocytes. With sustained availability of MVs in the IPL closed system (MVs were detectable in perfusate at the end of experiments), DiD fluorescence in Ly6Chigh monocytes reached levels (MFI: 447 ± 164) comparable to those observed in vivo in macrophage-depleted mice (MFI: 476 ± 116, Figure 4).In vitro assessment of MV uptake by lung-marginated Ly6Chigh monocytesTo further address the mechanisms of MV uptake by lung Ly6Chigh monocytes, we developed a novel in vitro assay using cells obtained by pulmonary vascular perfusion as an anatomically relevant (as well as abundant) source of monocytes. Lung-marginated leukocytes were harvested from untreated and low-dose LPS-challenged mice by ex vivo pulmonary perfusion and incubated in vitro with DiD-labelled J774-derived MVs. Under these conditions, the relative differences in uptake between subsets and increases due to endotoxemia were similar to those in vivo (Figure 6(a)). Internalization of MVs by Ly6Chigh monocytes was observed by confocal microscopy as punctate marks separated from plasma membrane anti-Ly6C antibody staining (Figure 6(c)), as well as by the robust resistance of cell-associated DiD signal when cells were treated with trypsin post-MV incubation (Figure 6(d)). Significant inhibition of MV uptake by low temperature, energy depletion treatments (incubation with NaF, NaN3 and antimycin A), and cytochalasin D and dynasore treatments to inhibit active endocytic processes [53], provided further evidence that internalization of MVs was unlikely to involve passive processes (such as MV-cell membrane fusion) or an artefact related to binding of any free DiD to the monocyte membrane. This latter possibility was also excluded by the lack of any significant cell-associated fluorescence following incubation of perfusate cells with DiD dye-only preparations, produced by the same incubation and centrifugation steps used for MV staining (Supplementary Figure S2: C&D).Using this in vitro assay system, we investigated the receptor-based mechanisms involved in MV uptake by Ly6Chigh monocytes. First, we measured expression of several known PS and scavenger receptors on lung monocytes and, for comparison, Kupffer cells, both harvested from untreated or LPS-treated mice. Of the receptors expressed on monocytes (Figure 7(a,b)) and Kupffer cells (Supplementary Figure S6), there was no substantial change in their levels during endotoxemia. There was, however, a clear heterogeneity of expression between monocyte subsets: Ly6Chigh monocytes expressed higher levels of integrin subunit β3 (CD61) involved in PS recognition [54] (p < 0.01) and scavenger receptor class A type I/II (CD204) (p < 0.01); while scavenger receptor class B (CD36) was almost exclusively expressed by the Ly6Clow subset (p < 0.01). We then assessed the effects of various inhibitors for these receptors on MV uptake by perfusate Ly6Chigh monocytes. Pre-incubation of perfusate cells with PC:PS-liposomes, but not PC-only liposomes, entirely abolished MV uptake by Ly6Chigh monocytes, and pre-incubation with the integrin-binding RGD motif peptide (RGDS) [54] resulted in nearly complete ablation of the uptake (Figure 7(c)), together strongly indicating an essential role for PS-αVβ3 integrin-dependent mechanisms. Pre-incubation with scavenger receptor A blockers, i.e. polyinosinic acid and dextran sulphate, partially inhibited MV uptake, by ~50%, compared to the respective negative control polymers (polycytidylic acid and chondroitin sulphate) (Figure 7(d)), also suggesting a contribution of CD204 in this MV uptake process.Uptake of PS-liposomes in vivoPS is present on the surface of most MVs, including the J774-derived MVs used here Figure 1(b)) and is a critical determinant of MV uptake by various target cell types in vivo and in vitro [14,15,55,56]. To assess the importance of PS recognition on redistribution of MV uptake during endotoxemia, we investigated in vivo uptake of PS-enriched liposomes labelled with DiD. As with J774-derived MVs, endotoxemia resulted in enhanced uptake of PS-liposomes by lung-marginated Ly6Chigh monocytes (Figure 8(a,d); Supplementary Figure S7) and their diminished uptake by Kupffer cells (Figure 8(b)). There were some qualitative differences from J774-derived MVs, most notably that PS-liposome uptake was not significantly increased in Ly6Clow monocytes or neutrophils during endotoxemia."}, "stats": {"Materials and methods": {"chars": 10023, "tokens": 1467, "source": "regular"}, "Results": {"chars": 12894, "tokens": 1844, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Journal of Extracellular Vesicles", "year": "2020", "doi": "10.1080/20013078.2019.1706708", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Strains carrying Phsp-6::GFP [20] or Ptbb-6::GFP [16] (reporters for UPRmt or MAPKmt, respectively) were tested in parallel (Fig. 1c–f). With the exception of sodium azide (which did not activate the MAPKmt pathway, but did activate the others), each drug significantly activated all three pathways (Fig. 1a, c, e, quantifications in Fig. 1b, d, f). Activation of endogenous ESRE genes measured via qRT-PCR following rotenone treatment confirmed reporter results (Additional File 1: Fig. S1). Interestingly, spg-7/SPG7(RNAi), which is a strong activator of both the UPRmt [21] and the MAPKmt pathways [16], did not trigger expression of the 3XESRE::GFP reporter in otherwise healthy worms (Fig. 1g, quantification in Additional File 1: Fig. S2A). SPG-7 is the C. elegans ortholog of the human Paraplegin protein, an inner mitochondrial membrane-localized protease involved in mitochondrial protein quality control [32, 33]. This was not an artifact caused by the minimal promoter construct used; spg-7/SPG7(RNAi) also failed to activate a Phsp-16.1::GFP reporter (Fig. 1g, quantification in Additional File 1: Fig. S2A). This construct contains a native, full-length promoter; responds to ESRE stimuli (Additional File 1: Fig. S2B); and contains two ESRE motifs [27]. In addition, the 3XESRE::GFP reporter was robustly activated by other mitochondrial toxins.To determine the breadth of ESRE surveillance, we tested whether other mitochondrial perturbations activated the 3XESRE::GFP reporter. RNAi was used to knock down several mitochondrial components, including cco-1/COX5B (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B), mrps-5/MRPS5 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5), tomm-20/TOMM20 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20), and tomm-22/TOMM22 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 22). In each case, the ESRE reporter remained dim (Additional File 1: Fig. S3A), further differentiating this surveillance network from UPRmt and MAPKmt which both showed strong response to each knockdown (Additional File 1: Fig. S3B, C).To ensure that ESRE pathway expression was being triggered by mitochondrial insults rather than general cell stress, worms carrying the 3XESRE::GFP reporter were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib, which induces proteasomal stress, or the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, which induces ER stress [34]. Although neither compound activated 3XESRE::GFP expression during a 20-h course of treatment, they did activate Prpt-3::GFP [35] and Phsp-4::GFP [34] control reporters, showing that they were behaving as expected (Additional File 1: Fig. S4). As ESRE activation usually occurs within 6–10 h, it is unlikely that this time frame was insufficient.We also tested each of the three reporters with a variety of abiotic stresses that activate the ESRE stress response network [27–31], including ethanol, sodium selenite, phenanthroline (an iron chelator), and heat shock (Additional File 2: Table S1). Generally, significant overlap in activation was observed amongst ESRE, UPRmt, and MAPKmt, but disparities were easily identified, suggesting that these pathways likely have both shared and independent functions.Reductive stress induces ESRE activationRotenone is the most potent activator of the minimal 3XESRE::GFP reporter that we have observed. Consistent with earlier findings for ESRE activation [28, 36], 3XESRE::GFP expression became noticeable after approximately 8 h of treatment and stayed high until death. Since complex I poisoning by rotenone is known to trigger release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) into mitochondria [37], we hypothesized that ROS production may be involved in ESRE pathway activation. To test this prediction, two antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, a precursor for glutathione [38]) and ascorbate (vitamin C [39, 40]), were added during rotenone treatment to determine if scavenging ROS would limit ESRE activation. The addition of ascorbate to 3XESRE::GFP worms treated with rotenone had the anticipated effect and reduced GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly however, the addition of 5 mM NAC had the opposite effect and increased, rather than reduced, ESRE activation (Fig. 2b). GFP expression was detectable earlier (6 h instead of 8 h), and the intensity was three times higher than with rotenone alone. Reducing the NAC concentration by half, to 2.5 mM, still increased GFP expression compared to rotenone only, but allowed direct comparison of treatments at 8 h (Fig. 2a, c). In contrast, the addition of NAC to rotenone had no effect on the activation of the UPRmt or MAPKmt pathways (Additional File 1: Fig. S5). It is unlikely that exacerbation of ESRE activation was due to NAC affecting fluorescence; NAC alone (in DMSO control) did not cause reporter expression for any of the pathways (Fig. 2a, c, Additional File 1: Fig. S5). Adding ascorbate to 3XESRE::GFP worms treated with rotenone and NAC still attenuated ESRE activation (Fig. 2a, c). The explanation for this was not immediately obvious. However, searching the literature, led to a potential explanation. Rotenone poisoning of complex I in mitochondria prevents transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q10, leading to an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio. NAC, which is directly reductive and can be a substrate for glutathione synthesis (another reducing substance), can further increase the available pool of reducing equivalents. These equivalents can deplete the cell of ROS, inducing a state of reductive stress [41–43]. This state can substantially alter the redox chemistry of the cell and can counterintuitively generate ROS by the direct transfer of electrons to O2 ([44], see also the “Discussion” section).To test this hypothesis, the NADH/NAD+ ratio was assessed in worms treated with rotenone, NAC, or both using the Peredox reporter [31, 45]. Fluorescence in this reporter is driven by an NADH-dependent conformational change, providing a semi-quantitative readout of the redox status of the cell. Consistent with our hypothesis, rotenone-triggered Peredox fluorescence was significantly increased when NAC was added (Fig. 2d, e). To confirm that this activity was specific to complex I-related damage, we substituted rotenone with CCCP. In direct contrast to its effect on rotenone treatment, the addition of NAC to CCCP largely eliminated 3XESRE::GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2f, g). Interestingly, the addition of ascorbate had no apparent effect on ESRE activation induced by CCCP. This suggests that the function of different antioxidants depends on biochemical events within the cell and that they should not be considered interchangeable.ESRE network activation correlates with ROS levelAs noted above, the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio and increased ESRE activation after treatment with NAC suggest that the ESRE network may be sensing reductive stress. If this is the case, there should be increased superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide in C. elegans treated with rotenone and NAC. To test whether treatment with rotenone and NAC generated ROS, worms were stained with dihydroethidium (DHE), a redox-sensitive dye widely used for the detection of superoxide. The reaction between DHE and superoxide results in the formation of a fluorescent product 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) that can be easily quantified [46, 47].However, there are concerns regarding the interpretation of DHE fluorescence as a specific indicator of superoxide, since the reaction of DHE with different ROS produces several oxidative products that are difficult to discriminate [46–50]. For example, DHE has been shown to be oxidized to ethidium (E+) by H2O2, which is different from 2-OH-E+ [46, 47] but with overlapping spectra that are exceptionally difficult to deconvolve [51]. Further complicating matters, superoxide is rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), either spontaneously or by superoxide dismutases (SODs) [52], and there is growing evidence that excess hydrogen peroxide can trigger the production of superoxide [53–56]. Consequently, it is difficult to unambiguously identify the ROS present in the worms. For these reasons, the general term ROS will be used to interpret DHE results.Consistent with our predictions, the addition of NAC to rotenone caused a surge of DHE fluorescence (Fig. 3a). In contrast, adding ascorbate reduced ESRE fluorescence and attenuated DHE fluorescence after rotenone treatment, with or without NAC. Both observations corroborate our hypothesis. Since the pattern of ESRE activation using CCCP differed from rotenone, DHE staining was also performed after exposure to CCCP in the presence or absence of either NAC or ascorbate. In this case, NAC, but not ascorbate, significantly reduced DHE signal (Fig. 3b), again matching ESRE fluorescence. Finally, we took advantage of the fact that spg-7(RNAi) did not activate the ESRE reporter to use this as a negative control. We measured basal DHE fluorescence of spg-7(RNAi) worms and saw that they were indistinguishable from vector controls (Additional File 1: Fig. S6). Several mitochondria-damaging conditions induced ROS production and activated all three mitochondrial surveillance pathways. For this reason, DHE fluorescence and reporter expression were measured under a variety of conditions to determine whether a broad correlation exists (Fig. 3c). Across the conditions tested, ESRE expression strongly and significantly correlated with ROS levels as detected by DHE staining; conditions that increased ROS concentration increased ESRE expression to nearly identical levels (e.g., direct linear correlation: ~ 3-fold increase in ROS resulted in ~ 3.5-fold increase in ESRE reporter). Interestingly, UPRmt and MAPKmt reporter upregulation only moderately correlated with ROS levels (e.g., 3.5-fold increase in ROS resulted in 2- and 1.5-fold increase in reporter expression, respectively). Since the pattern of ESRE expression correlated with DHE signals, we hypothesized that the ESRE network may be surveilling reductive stress by monitoring ROS levels.To test whether the ESRE pathway is generally activated by ROS-producing compounds, we tested whether juglone (a well-known producer of ROS) could also activate the ESRE reporter. Consistent with our prior experiments, we observed increases in DHE staining and ESRE gene expression following juglone exposure (Additional File 1: Fig. S7). gst-4, a SKN-1-dependent gene that has been well-characterized to respond to juglone [57] was used as a positive control.In a larger context, SKN-1 is generally considered to be a key regulator of the response to oxidative damage and toxins [58–60]. On this basis, we tested whether the Pgst-4::GFP reporter would respond to the conditions that activated the 3XESRE::GFP. Only juglone activated the Pgst-4::GFP reporter (Additional File 1: Fig. S8). Two explanations for these observations are possible: first, the level of damage inflicted by these compounds could be lower than the threshold for activation of Pgst-4::GFP. Second, it remains possible that the compounds are generating ROS of a particular type or in a particular location that does not activate the SKN-1 response. In either case, these data argue that the ESRE network exhibits selectivity.To further test the relationship between ROS and ESRE, we used 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), a cyclic piperidine nitroxide that mimics the function of SOD enzymes [61–63]. It does this by preferentially scavenging superoxide, although it can also catalyze the metabolism of other ROS [64], predominantly from the cytoplasm. TEMPOL reduced both 3XESRE::GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3d, e) and DHE staining (Fig. 3f) of rotenone-treated worms. A similar phenomenon (decreased 3XESRE::GFP fluorescence after rotenone treatment) was seen when mitoquinol (MitoQ or MQ10) was used instead (Fig. 3g). MQ10, a ubiquinol derivative targeted to mitochondria, acts as a mitochondria-specific scavenger for ROS [65]. These results may indicate that ROS in either compartment is sufficient for ESRE activation or that ROS (or its effects) can travel between the compartments. For example, hydrogen peroxide freely travels through membranes while mitochondrially generated superoxide can travel through the voltage-dependent anion channel [66].As an alternative method to attempt to distinguish the location of ROS that induces ESRE, we obtained knockout mutants for several SOD genes and quantified the mRNA levels of ESRE target genes in these mutants. The loss of both mitochondrial superoxide dismutases (sod-2;sod-3) or, to a some extent, sod-2 alone, increased basal expression of target genes (Additional File 1: Fig. S9). The loss of cytoplasmic SODs (sod-1 or sod-5) or the extracellular SOD (sod-4) had less effect. These results are consistent with, but do not prove, our hypothesis that the ESRE pathway is induced by mitochondrial superoxide. However, it remains unclear whether this occurs directly, indirectly through a mediator, or through the modulation of cytoplasmic ROS level.ESRE responds to exogenous H2O2 but does not correlate with endogenous peroxide levelsIn a further attempt to investigate whether it was superoxide or the resulting hydrogen peroxide that induced ESRE gene expression, worms were treated with exogenous H2O2 and 3XESRE::GFP levels were measured. Exogenous H2O2 triggered expression of both ESRE and UPRmt reporters (Additional File 1: Fig. S10A). However, adding H2O2 increased fluorescence of both DHE and Amplex Red (which exclusively measures cellular H2O2) [67] (Additional File 1: Fig. S10B, C).To attempt to gain insight into the sensitivity of DHE to O2− and H2O2 under our assay conditions, worms were exposed to a gradient of exogenous H2O2 concentrations and then stained with Amplex Red or DHE. As expected, the correlation of Amplex Red fluorescence with H2O2 was almost perfectly directly linear, with a 1:1 ratio (Additional File 1: Fig. S11A). In contrast, the relationship between DHE and H2O2 was clearly non-linear (Additional File 1: Fig. S11B). Instead, DHE fluorescence remained low as the concentration increased, and then began to increase linearly. Two explanations for this phenomenon suggest themselves. First, it may indicate the saturation detoxification process for H2O2, and once saturated, the DHE fluorescence begins to increase. Alternatively, it is possible that H2O2-mediated superoxide production only starts once peroxide reaches a threshold concentration.We compared 3XESRE::GFP expression, which was also measured in the same H2O2 gradient, to staining with Amplex Red and DHE. 3XESRE::GFP fluorescence correlated much more strongly with DHE fluorescence than with Amplex Red staining (Additional File 1: Fig. S11C, D).Finally, the level of H2O2 was measured with Amplex Red after worms were treated with the same panel of mitotoxins as were used earlier in this report (Additional File 1: Fig. S10D). Of the five compounds, only TTFA was different from DMSO, suggesting that the ROS produced by the compounds were not H2O2. We also determined correlation coefficients for each of the three mitochondrial surveillance reporters with Amplex Red fluorescence. In contrast to DHE fluorescence, no correlation was found between Amplex Red fluorescence and any of the mitochondrial surveillance pathways (compare Additional File 1: Fig. S10E and Fig. 3c). Combined, these data argue that the ESRE network is more likely to be responding to superoxide than hydrogen peroxide.UPRmt and the MAPKmt pathways restrict ESRE expression by limiting ROS productionTo test for interactions between mitochondrial surveillance pathways, key regulators for each pathway (when known) were genetically disrupted. First, atfs-1/ATF5 and pmk-3/MAPK were knocked down via RNAi, and (due to the TF for the ESRE reporter remaining unidentified) expression was assessed in RNAi-fed strains under basal and induction conditions.Under basal conditions, ESRE expression was unaffected by the presence or absence of functional atfs-1/ATF5, pmk-3/MAPK, or both (Fig. 4a). In contrast, ESRE activation was significantly affected when these pathways were compromised during mitochondrial stress. For example, the 3XESRE::GFP reporter was activated earlier (4 h after treatment in atfs-1/ATF5(RNAi) mutant, 5–6 h in pmk-3/MAPK(RNAi), compared to 8 h for vector) and fluorescence levels were higher (Fig. 4a, quantifications in Additional File 1: Fig. S12A). Disrupting both UPRmt and MAPKmt created an additive effect. On first glance, the lack of an apparent change in ESRE activation under basal conditions but increased activation under stress may appear inconsistent. However, inactivation of the UPRmt and MAPKmt pathways did result in higher levels of ROS (as measured by DHE staining, Fig. 4b) after stress. This was consistent with observations that both NADH accumulation and mitophagic activation occurred more rapidly after rotenone exposure if the UPRmt or MAPKmt pathways were disrupted (Fig. 4c, d). Next, spg-7/SPG7 was knocked down via RNAi alone or in combination with atfs-1/ATF5. spg-7 disruption had no apparent effect, alone or in combination with atfs-1/ATF5(RNAi), on the expression of the minimal ESRE reporter (Additional File 1: Fig. S12B). As this conflicted with a report from the Rea lab, where the double knockdown induced ESRE gene expression [16], we tested a more biologically accurate reporter construct, the Phsp-16.1::GFP reporter. The promoter region of hsp-16.1 is more complex and includes multiple regulatory elements, including two ESRE motifs [68]. Unlike the 3XESRE::GFP reporter, the Phsp-16.1::GFP reporter was activated by spg-7(RNAi); atfs-1(RNAi) in an ESRE-dependent fashion (Fig. 4e).Intricate genetic interactions exist between the UPRmt and the MAPKmt pathwaysPrevious work claimed that expression of the MAPKmt pathway was enhanced by loss of atfs-1/ATF5 during stress, but that the basal level was unaffected [16]. We attempted to recapitulate these data to gain a finer understanding of the interrelationship of these genetic pathways. In contrast to earlier observations, we saw that atfs-1(RNAi) increased Ptbb-6::GFP expression under non-stressed conditions (Fig. 5a) and that activation was further increased by stress induction with spg-7(RNAi). Combining spg-7(RNAi) with atfs-1/ATF5(RNAi) further increased activation of Ptbb-6::GFP, compared to spg-7(RNAi) alone, as was previously observed [16]. qRT-PCR measuring endogenous expression of MAPKmt target genes under atfs-1(RNAi) condition in the absence of stress confirmed basal upregulation (Additional File 1: Fig. S13A). These data suggest that the UPRmt normally serves to restrict MAPKmt pathway activity, either directly or by limiting the accumulation of MAPKmt pathway activators. We also showed that this repression was dependent on the MAPKmt regulatory network, as pmk-3(RNAi) was epistatic to atfs-1(RNAi). These observations were made for Ptbb-6::GFP (Fig. 5b) and for native MAPKmt targets (Additional File 1: Fig. S13B). We verified that this did not result from an off-target RNAi result by testing a CRISPR-generated deletion in atfs-1/ATF5 (atfs-1(cmh15)) [69], which showed essentially the same results (Additional File 1: Fig. S13C). During our investigation of the interrelationship of these pathways, we identified a full-length, perfect consensus match ESRE motif (TCTGCGTCTCT) in the promoter of atfs-1, located at − 87 to − 73 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Based on our previous experience, the presence of a single ESRE motif can be sufficient to mediate regulation of the gene, suggesting that atfs-1 may be a part of the ESRE network. To test the importance of the motif in atfs-1 expression, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate a precise deletion, removing only these 11 nucleotides (Patfs-1ΔESRE::ATFS-1WT) (Fig. 5c). Crossing this mutant with the Phsp-6::GFP and Ptbb-6::GFP reporter strains allowed us to observe that the expression of the Phsp-6::GFP reporter was decreased after removal of the ESRE site (Fig. 5d) and that atfs-1(RNAi) further diminished fluorescence (Fig. 5d). mRNA levels of atfs-1 and UPRmt targets were also decreased in Patfs-1ΔESRE::ATFS-1WT worms (Fig. 5e, Additional File 1: Fig. S14A). Meanwhile, we observed a moderate increase in the expression of the MAPKmt reporter, Ptbb-6::GFP, and endogenous MAPKmt target expression when Patfs-1ΔESRE::ATFS-1WT worms were reared on spg-7(RNAi) (Fig. 5f, Additional File 1: Fig. S14B). These results indicated the importance of the ESRE motif in the atfs-1 promoter for normal ATFS-1 expression and further indicate the presence of extensive crosstalk amongst mitochondrial surveillance pathways.Human ESRE genes were upregulated by ROSConsidering the high degree of conservation of the ESRE motif in humans [28], we sought to determine whether ROS levels influenced the expression of human orthologs of C. elegans ESRE genes. As noted previously, human orthologs of C. elegans ESRE genes frequently retain both the motif and responsiveness to ESRE-activating stimuli, despite the evolutionary distance [26, 28]. We used bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) and human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) to measure transcription for a panel of 10 human ESRE genes [26] via quantitative RT-PCR after exposure to CCCP (Fig. 6a, b). In general, the expression of ESRE genes in human cells followed the pattern observed in C. elegans. DHE staining verified that CCCP induced ROS production in RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 6c). Next, we measured the expression of the three most strongly induced ESRE genes in RWPE-1 cells treated with CCCP alone or in combination with TEMPOL or MitoTEMPO (a mitochondrial-targeted TEMPOL [54]). Similar to C. elegans, addition of either antioxidant decreased ESRE gene expression following CCCP induction (Fig. 6d). Combined, these data argue that ESRE gene expression is likely to respond to ROS concentration in both humans and C. elegans and that this may be the first stress response system known to be activated by reductive stress.", "Methods": "MethodsC. elegans strainsAll C. elegans strains were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) seeded with Escherichia coli strain OP50 as a food source and were maintained at 20 °C [80] unless otherwise noted.

Prior to experiments, worms were synchronized by hypochlorite isolation of eggs from gravid adults, followed by hatching of eggs in S Basal. Six thousand synchronized L1 larvae were transferred onto 10-cm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or NGM plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1 mM IPTG that were seeded with appropriate RNAi strains. After transfer, worms were grown at 20 °C for 50 h prior to use. Young adult worms were used for all assays unless otherwise noted.Bacterial strainsRNAi experiments in this study were done using RNAi-competent HT115 obtained from the Ahringer or Vidal RNAi library [82, 83]. All plasmids were sequence-verified prior to use.C. elegans chemical exposure assaysPrior to exposure to mitochondrial-damaging agents and/or antioxidants, synchronized young adult worms were washed from NGM plates seeded with OP50, and then resuspended in S Basal supplemented with one of the following: 50 μM antimycin A (Sigma), 50 μM rotenone (Sigma), 3 mM TTFA (Sigma), 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma), 20 μM CCCP (Sigma), 10% ethanol (Fisher), 1 mM phenanthroline (Sigma), 7 mM sodium selenite (Alfa Aesar), 1 mM H2O2 (Sigma), 60 μM tunicamycin (Thermo Fisher), 12.5 μM bortezomib (Thermo Fisher), 50 μM juglone (Sigma), 5 or 2.5 mM NAC (Acros Organics), 25 mM ascorbate (TCI), 5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical), and 10 μM mitoquinol (Cayman Chemical) in the presence of OP50. When specified, treatments were combined (e.g., rotenone/NAC, rotenone/NAC/ascorbate, etc.). Worms were imaged every 2 h for 20 h. Three biological replicates per experiment were performed, with ~ 400 worms per replicate.Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)Six thousand young adult worms were used for RNA purification and subsequent qRT-PCR (performed as previously described [84]). Prior to RNA extraction, worms were grown on RNAi bacteria from L1 stage to young adult stage. Primer sequences are available upon request. For each experiment, at least 3 biological replicates were used.Imaging and fluorescence quantificationFor visualization of the ALF86, CF1553, CL2166, GR2183, NVK90, NVK93, SJ4005, SJ4100, SLR115, WY703, and WY756 young adults exposed to mitochondrial-damaging agents in 96-well plates, Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) was used. All the imaging was performed with identical settings. GFP quantifications were performed by using Gen5 3.0 software and via flow vermimetry on COPAS FP (Union Biometrica). Approximately four hundred worms were used for Cytation 5 imaging and ~ 1000 worms were used for flow vermimetry per biological replicate, and three biological replicates were used for each experiment.ROS quantificationsSuperoxide was measured by using dihydroethidium (DHE) (Thermo Fisher) dye. Amplex Red assay was performed to measure hydrogen peroxide levels as described (Thermo Fisher). Worms were treated with mitochondrial-damaging agents for 10 h in 96-well plate before fluorescence measurement was taken. DHE was added at a final concentration of 3 μM and was let stained for 1 h in the dark. Worms were washed three times before reading to remove any remaining drugs or dye. Fluorescence intensities were recorded by using COPAS Biosort for DHE staining or Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) at 545/590 nm for Amplex Red.

Non-supplemented MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine was used for experiments. Cells were exposed to 20 μM CCCP or DMSO, alone or in combination with 0.5 mM TEMPOL (Cayman Chemical) or 2.5 μM MitoTEMPO (Cayman Chemical) in MEM with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 16 h prior to RNA extraction and purification.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to calculate the significance of a treatment when there were three or more groups in the experimental setting. To follow, Dunnett’s test (R package DescTools, version 0.99.34) was performed to calculate statistical significance or p values between each group of the statistically significant experimental results. Student’s t test analysis was performed to calculate the p values when comparing two groups in an experimental setting.

To obtain a quantitative understanding of substrate unfolding at the translocon, we conducted translocation experiments with murine DHFR (mDHFR, Fig. 1a). We constructed a chimeric translocation substrate protein by fusing mDHFR to the N-terminal 178 amino acids of pOA that included the signal sequence (Fig. 1b). Engineered cysteine residues at positions 122 and 152 in pOA allowed us to form an intramolecular loop by oxidation (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). The disulfide loop creates a physical barrier to translocation progress7,32, stalling the reaction at a position close to residue 122. When a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) is added, translocation resumes and the C-terminal portion of the fusion protein, including mDHFR, is imported (Supplementary Fig. 1).To analyze translocation kinetics at high time resolution, we utilized a recently described assay33 that continuously follows the reaction progress in real-time through light emission by the NanoLuc luciferase. NanoLuc can be split into two asymmetric fragments p86 (11 amino acids) and 11S (159 amino acids), neither of which has significant enzymatic activity. The p86 peptide tag binds 11S with very high affinity (KD = 700 pM)34, restoring luciferase activity. We genetically fused the p86 peptide to the C-terminus of pOA-mDHFR (Fig. 1b) and encapsulated 11S inside proteoliposomes containing reconstituted SecYEG and SecA (Fig. 1c).When the oxidized pOA-mDHFR fusion protein engages with the translocon complex, the pOA portion is translocated up to position 122, where the disulfide loop blocks further translocation (Fig. 1c, ➀). Translocation resumes after the addition of reducing agent until the folded mDHFR reaches the translocon (Fig. 1c, ➁). After mDHFR unfolding (Fig. 1c, ➂), translocation is completed, and luciferase activity is restored (Fig. 1c, ➃), reporting on translocation progress.Figure 1d shows a representative example of a real-time translocation measurement of pOA-mDHFR at room temperature in the absence of stabilizing ligands (“apo”). After addition of DTT to stalled translocon substrate complexes (arrowhead in Fig. 1d), luciferase activity began to increase after an initial delay and leveled off within approximately 30 min. To extract kinetic information from these measurements, we developed a detailed model (see Methods, and Supplementary Methods). The model takes into account the rates for mDHFR unfolding and translocation (kunfold, ktransloc), as well as luciferase substrate depletion and an additional rate that accounts for loss of translocatable substrate over time (“incapacitation”, see next section, Supplementary Fig. 2, and Supplementary Methods). The model fits the data well (Fig. 1d, and Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that it provides a suitable description of our experimental system.We determined the rates of unfolding and translocation to be kunfold(apo) = 0.025 min−1 and ktransloc(apo) = 0.245 min−1 (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for summaries of the fit parameters and their standard deviations). Previously reported translocation rates measured at 30 °C using similarly reconstituted translocon complexes ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 min−1 for substrate proteins that are not expected to contain stable structures35. The translocation rate that we extract from our kinetic data is consistent with these published values that were determined in traditional protease-protection assays.The results from our real-time translocation measurements indicate that unfolding of apo-mDHFR takes approximately 10 times longer than the actual translocation reaction. This result suggests that mDHFR is stably folded and poses a significant barrier to translocation, even in the absence of ligands. After mDHFR unfolding, the protein is fully translocated into the interior of the proteoliposomes. Following translocation continuously (sampling at a rate of ~0.2 Hz in our measurements) makes it possible to dissect the kinetic components of the process.Structure stabilization slows translocationA previous study, using protease protection to follow Sec-dependent import of a DHFR-fused substrate protein, indicated that the translocation of mDHFR is not significantly impaired by the ligand MTX alone, whereas a combination of MTX and NADPH slowed down the reaction26. In the presence of MTX, we observed a reduced overall rate of protein import into proteoliposomes (Fig. 1e). Analyzing the time trajectories obtained with MTX-bound pOA-mDHFR, we find that the unfolding rate is reduced to kunfold(MTX) = 0.012 min−1, approximately half the value obtained for the apo-protein. We therefore observe a small but measurable deceleration of unfolding in the presence of the ligand.A more pronounced effect on the overall rate of substrate import is observed when both MTX and NAPDH (M + N) are added. The unfolding rate is drastically reduced in this case to kunfold(M + N) = 0.0013 min−1, almost 20-fold lower than the rate for apo-mDHFR unfolding (Fig. 1f). The finding that simultaneous binding of MTX and NADPH stabilizes native mDHFR against translocon-mediated unfolding is consistent with previously reported results26. However, the time resolution afforded by our real-time translocation measurements allows us to separate unfolding from translocation kinetically and obtain rates for the two processes individually.Unfolding of mDHFR results in ligand dissociation36. Therefore, the translocated polypeptides are chemically identical in liganded and ligand-free conditions, avoiding the convoluting effects of polypeptide sequence on translocation rates35,37. Based on these considerations, the rate of translocation after unfolding of mDHFR is expected to be constant in all of our measurements. Indeed, fitting our model to the data yields translocation rates that are very similar in the presence (ktransloc(MTX) = 0.239 min−1 and ktransloc(M + N) = 0.230 min−1) and absence of ligands (ktransloc(apo) = 0.249 min−1). The agreement of translocation rates determined in our assay validates the model that we use to interpret our translocation measurements.While the translocation rates are similar, we noted that the amplitudes of the observed signal progressively decrease from the apo to the MTX and the M + N condition. The decrease in the final luminescence signal suggests that unfolding competes with a process that renders the system incapable of translocation. We therefore termed this process “incapacitation”. Incomplete translocation, indicating substrate attrition, is commonly observed in translocation measurements (see ref. 35, and references therein), but typically not accounted for. The incapacitation rates (kincap) are similar for all experimental conditions (kincap(apo) = 0.066 min−1, kincap(MTX) = 0.073 min−1, kincap(M + N) = 0.055 min−1; see Table 1 for standard deviations). However, because ligand binding decreases the unfolding rate while the rate of irreversible incapacitation remains constant, reduced amounts of translocated product are observed.Taken together, we find that the ligands MTX and NADPH stabilize mDHFR against unfolding by the translocon. The experimental design employed here, together with the detailed kinetic model that we have developed, allows us to quantify the unfolding rate at the translocon, which decreases in response to ligand binding, while the rate of translocation remains constant. Unfolding by the translocon has been suggested to be aided by mechanical force generated by SecA using ATP as fuel7,14, but quantitative measurements supporting this idea are lacking. Determining the unfolding kinetics of mDHFR under mechanical load would permit a quantitative comparison with the unfolding rates observed during translocation to test this hypothesis.mDHFR is mechanically stableTo determine the mechanical stability of mDHFR, we characterized its unfolding by single-molecule force spectroscopy with optical tweezers, a powerful tool for characterizing folding energy landscapes38–40. To make the protein amenable to mechanical manipulation, we genetically engineered sites for the attachment of molecular handles41 that link the termini of the protein to two beads, one held in a micropipette and the other in an optical trap (Fig. 2a). By moving the optical trap away from the micropipette, the tethered protein is subjected to mechanical force that acts as a denaturant, biasing the molecule toward unfolding.We carried out “force ramp” experiments by moving the optical trap at a constant velocity of 150 nm/s, while recording the force and the molecular extension. In the resulting force-extension curves, mDHFR unfolding manifests as a “rip” (arrowheads in Fig. 2b), a sudden increase in molecular extension. Figure 2b displays representative examples of initial unfolding events for seven mDHFR molecules. Unfolding occurs in a broad range of forces from approximately 10–55 piconewtons (pN). The mechanical stability of apo-mDHFR is similar to that of several other globular proteins that have been subjected to similar measurements, such as ribonuclease H42, calmodulin43, T4 lysozyme41, or elongation factor G44, which unfold within this force range. Interestingly, a previous study using atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated that Chinese hamster DHFR is mechanically weak29. The difference in mechanical behavior between the mouse and hamster proteins might be due to structural differences that have been observed by crystallography for closely related DHFR orthologs45.Most unfolding transitions observed in our experiments with apo-mDHFR occur in one apparent step. However, in some events occurring at low forces, a transient unfolding intermediate is observed (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The estimated contour length change for the transition from the native to the intermediate state is approximately 20–25 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4b), similar to an intermediate detected in AFM experiments of mDHFR30. The total length change for the initial unfolding events, calculated using a worm-like chain model46 matched the expectation for mDHFR unfolding (Fig. 2e, black dots and black line). The total unfolding length changes (ΔLunfolding) are distributed around ΔLunfolding = 65.8 nm (Fig. 2c, black histogram), very close to the expected value of ΔLunfolding(calc) = 65.4 nm (Fig. 2c, dotted line) calculated from the mDHFR crystal structure45. Taken together, the observed unfolding events are consistent with complete unfolding of natively structured mDHFR.After the initial unfolding event, we relaxed the force to allow refolding. Stretching the protein after holding it at a low force of 2 pN for 15 s yielded force-extension curves (Fig. 2c) with heterogeneous transitions that were either distinct from the initial ones or had similar properties (Fig. 2d, white and gray dots, respectively). Even the events that showed a length change similar to the initial unfolding (Fig. 2d, gray dots) exhibited contour length and unfolding force distributions that overlapped with, but were distinct from, the initial events (Fig. 2e, f). We conclude that mDHFR does not refold efficiently under our experimental conditions and therefore focused our analysis on the initial unfolding events.Unfolding force distributions obtained in force ramp experiments contain information about the underlying molecular process. For an unfolding process with one rate-limiting step, the continuously increasing unfolding rate results in a characteristic skewed distribution of the unfolding force47,48 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The unfolding force distribution of apo-mDHFR does not exhibit this characteristic shape (Fig. 2f). Instead, the distribution is consistent with at least two distinct barriers, resulting either from an equilibrium of states with distinct stabilities or from alternative unfolding pathways (Supplementary Fig. 5). Given the distinct distributions observed for initial and subsequent events (Fig. 2f), our results likely reflect the population of several native states, which has been observed for mDHFR49 and for the orthologous E. coli enzyme50. Unfolding from multiple states yields unfolding forces that are a combination of at least two distributions that cannot be reliably resolved. The apparent structural heterogeneity of apo-mDHFR therefore hampers a quantitative analysis of its mechanical properties.Taken together, our single-molecule unfolding experiments suggest that native mDHFR exists in a conformational equilibrium, populating at least two states that differ in their mechanical stabilities. Either state exhibits significant mechanical stability, which explains the observed slow unfolding during translocation. However, the apparent structural heterogeneity of apo-mDHFR hampers a quantitative analysis of its mechanical properties.Ligands increase mDHFR mechanical stabilityThe effects of ligand binding on the mechanical stability of mammalian DHFR are not well understood. Conflicting results from AFM experiments suggest either stabilization of the native state29, or no effect on native state stability but stabilization of an unfolding intermediate30. Force ramp experiments in the presence of 10 µM MTX (Fig. 3a) yielded transitions with contour length changes of ΔLunfolding = 63.4 nm, close to the expected value (Fig. 3b). As observed with apo-mDHFR, some unfolding traces recorded in the presence of MTX exhibit a transient intermediate (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, the unfolding forces in the presence of MTX are higher than those of apo-mDHFR, ranging from 33 to 57 pN (Fig. 3c). Compared to the scenario of apo-mDHFR, the shape of the unfolding force distribution for MTX-bound mDHFR more closely matches the expectation for unfolding from a single well-defined state (see Supplementary Fig. 5).Adding both MTX and NADPH further stabilizes mDHFR. Some unfolding events occur near the characteristic overstretching plateau of the DNA handles (Fig. 3d). While the distribution of contour length changes is indistinguishable from the MTX condition (Fig. 3e), the unfolding forces are shifted toward higher values (Fig. 3f) that range from 33 to 64 pN. Notably, the unfolding force distributions obtained with liganded mDHFR are consistent with a single folded state, in contrast to the observation of multiple states of the apo protein. The ligand concentrations used here are well above the dissociation constants49, and the enzyme therefore is mostly in the ligand-bound state, which appears to be mechanically very stable. Taken together, our single-molecule experiments reveal that the ligands MTX and NADPH additively stabilize mDHFR against mechanical denaturation.SecA actively promotes unfoldingOur single-molecule measurement demonstrate that ligand binding stabilizes mDHFR (Figs. 2 and 3), which is reflected in slower unfolding of the protein during translocation (Fig. 1). Spontaneous unfolding of mDHFR (as posited by the Brownian ratchet model of translocon activity) or active unfolding (which would indicate that SecA functions as a power-stroke motor) could both explain this observation. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we quantitatively compared unfolding rates from biochemical translocation experiments to the mechanical properties of mDHFR from optical tweezers measurements.To define the unfolding kinetics of mDHFR under force, we utilized the method of Dudko and co-workers48 to convert the unfolding force distributions into native state lifetimes. Their dependence on force was modeled with an approximation51 of Kramers’ theory52, which yields an analytical description for the unfolding rates of mDHFR under mechanical load using the parameters k0 (the intrinsic unfolding rate), ∆x‡ (the transition state distance), ∆G‡ (the barrier height). This analytical description makes it possible to obtain unfolding rates in force ranges that are not directly accessible in pulling experiments.We developed a maximum-likelihood method for analyzing unfolding force distributions of the single (MTX) and double (M + N) ligand conditions (see Methods, and Supplementary Methods). The presence of several native states in apo mDHFR, which cannot reliably be characterized in our experiments, precluded a similar analysis for this data set. To extend the unfolding force range covered in our experiments, we collected data at a lower trap velocity of 20 nm/s. As expected, reduced loading rates result in unfolding at lower forces (Fig. 4a, b, histograms). Globally fitting the Kramers-like model to both the slow and fast pulling rate datasets yielded one set of parameters for each ligand condition (Table 2). The force distributions reconstructed from the fitting parameters match the data reasonably well (Fig. 4a, b, lines), indicating that our approach yields a good description of the mechanical unfolding kinetics of mDHFR over a relatively wide force range.The folded state lifetimes at any given force are higher in the double-ligand condition than in the single-ligand case (Fig. 4c), reflecting the higher average unfolding forces. Having defined the response of mDHFR to force quantitatively, we can relate it to the unfolding rates observed during translocation to estimate the magnitude of mechanical force that might be applied by the translocon. Matching the respective rates to the force-dependent lifetimes, we obtain similar force values of Ftranslocon(MTX) = 10.6 pN and Ftranslocon(M + N) = 11.8 pN (Fig. 4c and d). These results strongly suggest that SecA acts as an active unfoldase, applying the equivalent of approximately 10 pN of constant force to the translocating substrate protein (Fig. 4e). Taken together, our data support a model of SecA acting as a power-stroke motor that unfolds proteins during translocation.", "Methods": "MethodsBacterial strains and primersThe proOmpA-mDHFR fusion protein for translocation measurements was produced in E. coli strain MM523. All other proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21-Gold (DE3) (Agilent). All primers used to construct plasmids for recombinant gene expression were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Their sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Cloning and expression and purification of pOA-mDHFRThe coding sequence for the first 178 amino acids of pOA were amplified by PCR from a parent pOA plasmid using primers for Gibson assembly that added a GSGS linker at the C-terminus. The entire mDHFR ORF was PCR amplified from a mDHFR plasmid with a C-terminal AviTag fused to the mDHFR fragment using Gibson Assembly (NEB). The backbone contained a T7 promoter. Cysteines were added at the desired positions using either site directed mutagenesis or insertion of synthetic DNA fragments (gBlocks, IDT). The p86 peptide sequence VSGWRLFKKIS34 was added to the end of the of the construct via PCR. The resulting plasmid (termed pOA-mDHFR) was transformed into E. coli strain MM52, which contains temperature sensitive SecA allele. A starter culture was grown at the permissive temperature (30 °C) until it reached OD600 of 0.5. The culture was then shifted to the restrictive temperature (37 °C), and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h. The cell pellet was harvested and washed with cold 1X PBS. Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) in 1X PBS pH 7.5. Inclusion bodies were washed with 1X PBS three times. Inclusion bodies were pelleted and frozen in liquid N2. The substrate protein was solubilized from inclusion bodies in 6 M urea before use.Expression and purification of SecYEGPlasmid pSOS334, encoding cysteine-free His-SecY, SecE and SecG, was a generous gift from Dr. Shu-ou Shan. Transformed BL21-Gold(DE3) cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.4–0.6 at 37 °C before expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 30,000g to remove cell debris, membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and solubilized in dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM). SecYEG was isolated by ion exchange chromatography on a sulfo-propyl resin, followed by affinity purification with NiNTA resin. The purified protein was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C in 50 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5, 150 mM KOAc, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.2% DDM.Expression and purification of SecAA plasmid encoding cysteine-free SecA with an N-terminal His tag was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG at 37 °C in cultures with an OD600 of 0.4 to 0.6. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KOAc, 10% glycerol with 1 tablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 °C to remove cell debris, the protein was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography on a NiNTA resin in 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KOAC, 10% glycerol, and eluted with 300 mM imidazole. The eluted product was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer without imidazole. Protein aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C.Cloning and purification of NanoLuc 11 S and GST-darkThe codon optimized 11S sequence was obtained as a synthetic DNA fragment (IDT DNA) and cloned into a His-SUMO backbone (Addgene Plasmid #37507) for expression. The coding sequence for the p86 “dark” peptide (VSGWALFKKIS)33 was inserted into a plasmid encoding glutathione S transferase (GST) to generate a C-terminal fusion in the same backbone and termed “GST-dark.” For expression, plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.2% arabinose at 37 °C when the OD600 reached 0.4–0.6. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction at 37 °C and lysed by sonication in 1x PBS pH 7.5 with 1 tablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 °C to remove cell debris, the protein was affinity purified from the supernatant using a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) in 1XPBS pH 7.5 and eluted with 300 mM imidazole. After cleavage of the His-SUMO tag, pure protein was obtained by reverse Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in 1x PBS pH 7.5. The protein was concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen in liquid N2.Encapsulation of 11S in SecYEG/SecA proteoliposomesUnilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion of E. coli polar lipids (Avanti) suspended in 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl through membranes with a 200-nm pore diameter. In order to swell the liposomes, 4.7 mM DDM was added to 5 mM lipids. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, proteins (5 µM SecYEG, 5 µM SecA, and 50 μM 11 S) were added to liposomes. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by 4 incubations with BioBeads SM-2 (BioRad) to remove the detergent. The proteoliposomes were isolated by centrifugation at 250,000g, 30 min at 4 °C, in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and run over a Sephacryl 200 column in order to remove unincorporated 11S from the proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes were recovered by ultracentrifugation before resuspension. They were flash frozen in liquid N2 for storage at –80 °C.Intramolecular disulfide bond formation in pOA-mDHFRIntramolecular disulfide bond formation in pOA-mDHFR was achieved by incubation with Cu2+/phenanthroline60. 1 mM Cu2+/phenanthroline was added to 10 µM protein and incubated at 4 °C for 18 h. Disulfide bond formation was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Oxidized protein was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until needed for translocation experiments.Protease-protection translocation assayTranslocation substrates were synthesized in vitro using the PURExpress system (NEB) in the presence of [35S]-methionine for 2 h at 37 °C. The translation reaction was transferred to ice and precipitated with three volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate in 20 mM HEPES. Precipitated protein was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 6 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Disulfide bond formation was achieved by incubation with 400 μM sodium tetrathionate for 30 min. Translocation reactions were performed in the presence of 0.2 μM SecYEG in proteoliposomes, 1.2 μM SecA, and in vitro synthesized substrate diluted 1:50, and in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 20 μg ml−1 BSA. After addition of 5 mM ATP, translocation up to the disulfide bond was allowed to proceed for 15 min. Subsequently, the disulfide bond in the substrate was reduced with 50 mM DTT, marking time zero. After translocation at 37 °C, sample were taken at defined time points and the reaction was quenched by addition of 18 mM EDTA and 1.5 M urea. Samples were then treated with 2 mg ml−1 proteinase K on ice for 30 min, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Real-time translocation assayExperiments conducted in the presence of MTX included 10 µM MTX in the buffer. Experiments conducted in the presence of both MTX and NADPH contained both 10 µM MTX and 10 mM NADPH in the buffer. Experiments for the apo conditions did not contain either ligand. For translocation measurements, 11S encapsulated proteoliposomes were incubated with buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 8, 100 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.1% Prionex) and 10 µM GST-dark for 10 min at room temperature. pOA-mDHFR containing a disulfide bond was added along with NanoGlo Live Cell Assay Buffer with NanoGlo substrate. After the addition of 5 mM ATP the reaction was taken to a plate reader (Promega GloMax Navigator) and the luminescence collected for approximately 30 min. During this time, additional GST-dark (0.5 µM) was added. After the luminescence signal plateaued, 1 mM DTT was added to reduce the disulfide bond and restart translocation, followed by luminescence data collection for 30 min. Background luminescence readings were collected in parallel for each reaction, using the same conditions and protocol described above except that water was added instead of ATP. Luminescence readings were collected continuously at a sampling rate of 0.2 Hz.Cloning and expression and purification of mDHFRTo generate an expression construct for mDHFR, we amplified the open reading frame from a mouse cDNA library using polymerase chain reaction and inserted it into a pBAD His6 Sumo TEV LIC cloning vector (Addgene Plasmid #37507) that had been engineered to encode an N-terminal Avi tag and C-terminal ybbR tag61. The mDHFR plasmid was transformed into BL21-Gold(DE3) (Agilent Technologies) host cells, and protein expression was induced with final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose (AMRESCO) at 37 °C when OD600 reached 0.4–0.6. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction at 37 °C. Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin) in 1X PBS pH 7.5 with two tablets of CompleteMini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche). After cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000g, 4 °C to remove cell debris, the protein was affinity purified from the supernatant using a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The protein was dialyzed against 1X PBS overnight in the presence of 1:1000 (w/w) Ulp1 to remove the His6-SUMO tag. The cleaved protein was applied to the HisTrap column again to remove the His6-SUMO moiety and the His6-tagged Ulp1 enzyme. The purified protein in the flow through was then incubated with 1 µM BirA biotin ligase in 1X biotinylation buffer (25 μM d-biotin, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM Mg-acetate) at 25 °C for 1 h to ensure complete biotinylation of the Avi-tagged protein. Insoluble protein was removed via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C. The product was concentrated and loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column, and the flow through collected. After concentration, protein aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C.Derivitization of mDHFRIn order to immobilize mDHFR on polystyrene beads for optical tweezers experiments, we modified the biotinylated, ybbR-tagged protein with a CoA-modified double-stranded DNA (dsOligo-CoA) that also contained a “sticky end” for ligation in an Sfp-mediated reaction61. After the reaction, the sample was centrifuged briefly (10 min, 16,000g, 4 °C) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) to remove Sfp and unreacted dsOligo-CoA. Successful derivatization was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, and the modified protein was flash frozen in small aliquots and stored at −80 °C.Optical tweezers experimentsWe carried out optical tweezers experiments using a single trap optical tweezers instrument with two counter-propagating 845 nm diode lasers62. Single mDHFR molecules were tethered as described by Liu et al.61. All optical tweezers experiments were performed in 1X PBS, 1 mM EDTA and ligand depending on the experimental condition. One bead was held in the optical trap while the other was held on the micropipette. Force ramp data were collected with pulling velocity of 20 nm s−1 or 150 nm s−1 and a trap stiffness of ~0.1 pN nm−1. The force was increased until an unfolding event was observed, after which the force was decreased to 2 pN and the protein was allowed to refold for 15 s. Unfolding forces and extension changes were determined as described in detail in Liu et al.61. Contour length changes were calculated from extension changes using a worm-like chain model with a persistence length of 0.65 nm. Expected contour length changes were calculated using a contour length increment of 0.36 nm per amino acid for the unfolded polypeptide and a native-state end-to-end distance of 1.6 nm, determined from the mDHFR crystal structure coordinates pdb 1u70.Determination of kinetic rates from translocation dataThe time evolution of the luminescence signal in translocation experiments reflects the kinetics of sequential processes that result in substrate protein import, as well as interfering side-processes. The productive processes considered in our mathematical model are translocation, stalling at the disulfide loop, and unfolding. A competing process results in translocon incapacitation, i.e. the irreversible loss of translocation activity. Our model quantitatively describes translocation of pOA-mDHFR as a series of events: translocon engagement, stalling at the disulfide loop, translocation to the folded mDHFR roadblock, mDHFR unfolding and completion of translocation. We also take into account complicating processes that contribute to the total signal, namely the presence of substrate without a disulfide loop, incapacitation, and luciferase substrate depletion. Supplementary Fig. 2 provides a graphical overview of the model. A full description of the mathematical model is provided in Supplementary Methods.Determination of unfolding ratesThe protein unfolding rate in force spectroscopy measurements depends on the applied force. This force dependence is reflected in the distribution of rip forces from force ramp experiments. Dudko et al.48 developed a method to transform unfolding force distributions into force-dependent lifetimes. The force-dependent lifetimes can then be fit with an appropriate model to obtain an analytical expression for the unfolding rate as a function of force. This approach typically requires binning of the unfolding forces, resulting in loss of force resolution due to finite bin size. To avoid this information loss, we developed an analysis procedure that converts the force dependence of the unfolding rate into a probability distribution, which we then fit to our data using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach allowed us to use the experimentally observed loading rate for each molecule individually and calculate a global fit for datasets that cover a wide range of loading rates. A full description of the analysis method is provided in Supplementary Methods."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 17941, "tokens": 2601, "source": "regular"}, "Methods": {"chars": 14029, "tokens": 2205, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-17561-2", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Despite having this system in place, our parallel experiments with VACV were met with little success. For this reason, we set up fluorescent virus systems to quantify the efficiency of any CRISPR/Cas9 activity, starting without a repair template to examine VACV genome editing by NHEJ. To ensure we would have active Cas9/gRNA in the cytoplasm, we transfected these as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes instead of expressing them in cells from plasmids. We infected cells with a VACV expressing mCherry from a disrupted viral thymidine kinase (TK) locus and transfected Cas9 complexes loaded with either an mCherry (mCh)-specific or TK-specific gRNA as test and negative control, respectively (Fig. 1a). After 48 h, the level of red fluorescence appeared to be lowest for the culture treated with the mCh-gRNA by microscopy (Fig. 1b) a result that was supported by flow cytometry (Fig. 1c). The majority of the cells were then frozen and thawed to release the virus, serially diluted and used to infect new wells so that plaques could be scored for loss of fluorescence as evidence of genome editing (Fig. 1d). All plaques from control cultures were fluorescent, but non-fluorescent plaques appeared at ~5% when the mCh-gRNA was used (Fig. 1d). We noted that this low fraction of mCh− VACV plaques did not match the roughly 30% reduction of fluorescence seen by flow cytometry (Fig. 1c). In similar experiments, including many using various plasmids to deliver Cas9/gRNA, this fraction of non-fluorescent plaques has ranged from <1% to as much as 10%, but never approached the routinely high levels (40–60%) seen in previous work when using the same gRNA to target an mCherry-expressing HSV34. A difference in protocol between our HSV and initial VACV experiments was the order of infection and transfection of cultures. However, when the order of these steps was compared directly for VACV we found the same level of editing irrespective of whether infection with parent virus or transfection of Cas9/gRNA was done first (Fig. 1e).To next determine if inefficient gene editing by CRISPR via NHEJ was specific to the mCherry gRNA or the TK locus, we used the same protocol to knock out eGFP when located in three different sites of the VACV genome as fusions to genes F5L, A3L and B5R (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 1). When these viruses were used to infect cells transfected with Cas9/eGFP-gRNA complexes, green fluorescence was reduced (Supplementary Fig. 2), but, regardless of location, recovery of GFP− plaques was low (Fig. 1g)37,38. Together with our experiments with mCherry, these data show that poor CRISPR editing of VACV genomes by NHEJ is a general finding across genome sites and target genes.CRISPR/Cas9 targeting does not improve recombination frequency for VACVNHEJ requires a range of host proteins, not all of which might be available in the cytoplasm. By contrast, VACV proteins are sufficient for homologous recombination. Accordingly, we went on to test whether Cas9 targeting might lead to efficient editing of VACV by HDR. In these experiments, we used a non-recombinant VACV (VACV WR), a repair plasmid with an mCherry expression cassette and homology arms matching sequences either side of the viral TK gene (pSC11-mCh), and a Cas9/TK-gRNA complex (Fig. 2a). Cells were infected with virus and simultaneously transfected with Cas9 complexes and the repair plasmid. After 48 h, virus was harvested and dilutions used to infect new cultures for the assessment of successful insertion of mCherry by microscopy (Fig. 2b). There was no significant difference in the proportion of mCh+ plaques produced with or without the addition of the Cas9/TK-gRNA complexes. This suggests that targeting of Cas9 to the insertion site did little, if anything, to improve upon basal rates of homologous recombination between the VACV genome and HDR repair template.To test if the results above were a function of the site targeted we investigated a second locus in the genome (Fig. 2c)39. In this experiment, the repair plasmid, pBII-ΔR, was used to replace 23 kb at the right arm of the VACV genome, from genes Spi2 (B13R) to C11R in the inverted terminal repeat (ITR), with mCherry. Not only is this a different region of the genome, but the area being manipulated is much larger and so the generation of this virus might be considered more challenging. Nevertheless, the Cas/gRNA complex that we used to target a site in the Spi2 gene that is deleted in the desired recombinant had no significant impact on the frequency with which mCh+ plaques were found (Fig. 2d). Indeed, recombination rates were similar as seen in our previous experiment. These data demonstrate that regardless of site or size of a genetic manipulation, the use of CRISPR does little to increase the frequency of genome editing by HDR for VACV.CRISPR/Cas9 impairs VACV replicationIn the NHEJ experiments above, as well as the substantial reduction of fluorescence in Cas9/mCh-gRNA targeted cultures, we also noticed less cytopathic effect, hinting at reduced virus replication (Fig. 3a). These suggest that there was an effect of Cas9/gRNAs on VACV growth. For this reason, we formally quantified the infectious virus produced in each culture using a standard plaque assay. VACV-mCh production was significantly reduced in cultures transfected with Cas9/mCh-gRNA complexes compared with the irrelevant TK-gRNA or no Cas9 (Fig. 3b). This result was surprising because mCherry is a non-viral gene and so non-essential for VACV replication. This led us to ask whether targeting an essential VACV gene might impact viral replication to an even greater extent. We chose A23R, which (a) encodes a viral transcription factor, (b) is critical for viral replication and (c) has been targeted with CRISPR/Cas9 previously33,40,41. When A23R was targeted in VACV-mCh infected cultures, production of virus was reduced to the same extent as when mCh was the gRNA target (Fig. 3c). These data were again recapitulated when we targeted other sites in the genome by using Cas9/eGFP-gRNA complexes to target eGFP in VACV F5-, A3- and B5-GFP viruses (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that it does not matter if an essential or non-essential gene is targeted by Cas9/gRNA complexes, the outcome will be a similar substantial impairment to VACV replication. This is reminiscent of a study where cells treated with GFP- or A23R-specific gRNAs survived longer after VACV-GFP infection than untreated cells33. Targeting of non-essential genes also leads to reduced replication of adenovirus and HSV-1, but comparisons with the effect of targeting essential genes have not been made for these viruses7. Finally, we examined virus replication when a template for HDR was introduced in addition to Cas9/gRNA targeting. For the two sites in the genome examined in Fig. 2, cell damage and virus growth were inhibited by Cas9/gRNA complexes (Fig. 3e–h). Taken all together, these data demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is active in the context of VACV infection, presumably reducing replication by cutting viral genomes. We speculate that therefore that the inefficiency in Cas9-mediated genome editing for VACV is due to poor repair, rather than an inability of Cas9/gRNAs to access and cut VACV genomes.Cas9 targeting of the VACV genome occurs prior to replicationNext, we wanted to probe the timing of Cas9 activity against VACV. VACV factories are viral replication centres formed within infected cells. Given that formation of these factories begins early after infection, we postulated that they would only be altered if Cas9/gRNAs acted soon after viral entry. Immunofluorescence was used to visualise factory development in cells transfected with Cas9/gRNA complexes and infected with VACV-mCh. Factories were found in all cultures from 4 hpi, but the number of cells with factories and the size of these factories relative to the nucleus were reduced at 6 and 8 hpi in cultures with Cas9/mCh-gRNA (Fig. 4a, b). These results provide evidence that Cas9/gRNA is acting on VACV genomes very early during infection.To demonstrate more directly that VACV genomes can be targeted by Cas9 and that this occurs soon after virus entry, we developed a qPCR strategy using primers spanning Cas9-targeted and non-targeted sites. This allowed us to measure genome cleavage at a particular site as a loss of PCR templates relative to the number of viral genomes. VACV-mCh-infected cells were transfected with Cas9 and mCh-, A23R- or non-targeting-gRNAs, and DNA was extracted at various time-points. Using primers and probes to detect mCherry or A23R, we were then able to determine if these loci were lost and/or replicated poorly in cultures when these sites were targeted by Cas9. In cultures where mCherry was targeted, copies of this site were not obviously lost, but viral replication of this part of the genome was delayed compared with other sites, as quantified by the mCherry and A23R qPCRs, respectively (Fig. 4c, d). Likewise targeting of A23R led to a delayed increase in copy number of this gene, but not mCherry. To directly compare amounts of the targeted gene versus a second site in the genome, we reanalysed the qPCR data from the experiment above to show these relative to each other. This analysis shows that as expected, the two sites of interest maintained a one-to-one ratio throughout the infection in cultures transfected with Cas9/TK-gRNA, which is unable to target the VACV-mCh genome. However, when Cas9/mCh-gRNA was transfected before infection, mCherry amounts fell away relative to A23R and vice versa when Cas9/A23R-gRNA was transfected (Fig. 4e, f). These differences were statistically significant from 3 hpi, demonstrating that Cas9/gRNA targets VACV genomes very early after infection.Taken together, the reduction in number and size of virus factories and loss of uniform genome replication from the earliest times reinforce the idea that Cas9/gRNAs targets incoming VACV genomes. The most likely mechanism of Cas9 action is the cutting of these genomes and separation of the two fragments such that full genome replication cannot be completed and factory development is inhibited. Dissociation of the cut ends of the genome prior to incorporation in a viral replication complex would also explain the failure of efficient repair by HDR as seen in Fig. 2.Cas9 targeting applies selective pressure to VACVsThe two existing hurdles associated with traditional VACV genome engineering are (1) producing initial recombinants and (2) selecting these from a large background of parent virus. Our starting premise was that CRISPR/Cas9 would improve the production of initial recombinants by facilitating recombination, as in other applications, but our results suggest that Cas9 simply inhibits replication of targeted VACV genomes. Putting these together, we proposed that the best use of Cas9 in the process of engineering VACV might be to select, rather than generate, recombinants. The only requirement for such an application would be that the desired recombinant differs from its parent by the loss of a gRNA target site. To test this proposal, the virus populations shown in Fig. 1, that had a low rate of mCherry− mutants (‘initial’ in Fig. 5a), were used to infect cells transfected with Cas9/mCh-gRNA. We also included two negative control gRNAs: TK-gRNA that has no target site on the genome and A23R-gRNA that targets the genome at an irrelevant site. In these cultures, ‘selected’ in Fig. 5a, we saw a distinct pattern where Cas9 targeting of mCherry did not appear to protect cells from cytopathic effect as well as in the initial culture, despite markedly reducing mCherry expression, hinting at the presence of a substantial mCh− population (Fig. 5a). By contrast, the use of Cas9/A23R-gRNA, considerably reduced cytopathic effect in both the ‘initial’ and ‘selected’ cultures. This was confirmed when plaques grown from the selection cultures were scored for fluorescence, revealing that mCh− plaques had increased to 60% when selected by the mCh-gRNA, but remained very low when the TK-gRNA or A23R-gRNA were used (Fig. 5b). Total virus output was also greater from the culture where mCh-gRNA was used for selection, likely reflecting outgrowth of the mCh− population during selection (Supplementary Fig. 3). To demonstrate selection visually, we used traditional homologous recombination to achieve the first step in replacing the mCherry gene in VACV-mCh with Venus. The progeny of this recombination culture were then selected by a round of replication in cells that were transfected with Cas9/mCh-gRNA or control RNPs (Fig. 5c). Live-cell imaging of the selection cultures allowed us to visualise selection of Venus+ VACV in real-time (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Video 1). In cultures transfected with Cas9/mCh-gRNAs, the outgrowth of Venus+ virus was evident after 24 h and continued over the next 2 days. By contrast, when the non-targeting Cas9/TK-gRNA control was used, any Venus+ virus was swamped by the mCherry+ VACV-mCh parent at all times. Finally, Cas9/A23R-gRNA that targets an irrelevant site in the genome inhibited all virus growth as indicated by dramatically reduced cytopathic effect and fluorescence of either colour. Overall, these results demonstrate that Cas9/gRNA complexes can be used as a robust and specific selection tool for rapidly eliminating parent virus from a population, allowing expansion of desired recombinants.Optimised method for generating recombinant VACVs by Cas9 selectionThe ability to rapidly select recombinant VACVs has wide implications for vaccine vector and oncolytic virus development. We thus attempted to develop a streamlined selection pipeline for scientific and therapeutic applications. Our method has three steps, initial recombination then two rounds of Cas9 selection, taking a total of 6 days (Fig. 6a). For initial validation, we used the same fluorescent virus model as in the last figure, replacing mCherry in VACV-mCh with Venus. This allowed the progress of selection to be checked by keeping some virus aside at each step and scoring plaques for fluorescence. After initial recombination, Venus was detected in 5% of the progeny plaques, with some of these being double-positive (DP) for Venus and mCherry (Fig. 6b). The first round of selection with a Cas9/mCh-gRNA reduced the total yield of virus but more importantly increased the fraction of Venus+ plaques dramatically to 80%, the majority of which were Venus+ only (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 4a). One concern with this method is the possibility of editing by NHEJ and outgrowth of these unwanted viruses during the selection steps, which was seen when there is no recombinant virus to be selected (Supplementary Fig. 4b). However, in our main experiment where we were selecting Venus+ virus from a background of mCh+ parent, there was a very low frequency of editing by NHEJ as reflected by plaques with neither fluorescent marker (double-negative) after this first selection step (Fig. 6b). The second selection step then almost completely removed the remaining parental virus, and total virus output was now similar to a non-targeted culture (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 4a). Importantly, there was no significant increase in plaques with no fluorescence, again pointing to very low levels of editing by NHEJ such that these viruses are unable to compete with the desired recombinant VACV during selection and are not a problem. We also tested A23R-gRNA, which cuts VACV genomes at an irrelevant site relative to our desired recombinant. While this reduced virus titre, it did not lead to selection of Venus+ plaques, which were lost completely after the second selection step (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). These data suggest virus selection by this method is gRNA-specific, as expected, and not a side-effect of the reduction of virus growth caused by targeting the genome at other sites. This method generates high frequencies of desired recombinant VACVs in less than a week such that only a handful of plaques would need to be screened to select recombinants for the establishment of clonal stocks.CRISPR/Cas9 selection can be efficiently used to select marker-free virusesOur previous example used fluorescent viruses, but a better test of the method would be to rapidly generate a recombinant VACV with a small edit and no observable phenotype in vitro, something that can often take weeks to months. Marker-free viruses are considered better research tools and marker genes are typically unacceptable in therapeutics and vaccines. VACV Spi2 protein, encoded by B13R, is a serine protease inhibitor that influences viral pathogenesis but not growth or plaque characteristics in vitro and was chosen as a target due to ongoing projects within the laboratory42–50. To construct Spi2-knockout viruses, we designed a recombination vector to replace 20 bp of B13R with a sequence that introduces a premature stop codon, removes the recognition site for a Spi2-specific gRNA and adds two restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 7a). Starting with wild-type VACV, we used this plasmid and Cas9/Spi2-gRNA in the 3-step protocol described in the last experiment, except in this case 10 plaques grown from the progeny of each culture were tested by PCR for evidence of the desired recombinant (Fig. 7b). To ensure we were not seeing a non-specific effect of Cas9, we again used a non-targeting gRNA (mCh-gRNA) as a control. Compiling data from two independent experiments, we detected Spi2 recombinant viruses by PCR at a frequency of 55% after two rounds of Cas9/Spi2-gRNA selection (Fig. 7c). Again, selection of desired recombinants was accompanied by reduction in total virus production, implying suppression of parent virus replication (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We also confirmed the identity of the Spi2 recombinant viruses by restriction digest and DNA sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Of the 20 plaques from the two experiments, all had either parent or desired recombinant sequence, as expected from the initial PCR screen and confirmed by restriction digests. Notably, none of these sequences showed evidence of editing by NHEJ, again suggesting that this process is not a confounder in our selection method. To gain a better estimate of the efficiency of Cas9/Spi2-gRNA selection, we screened an additional 100 plaques grown from the progeny of the recombination and second selection cultures. Using this method, we found that Spi2-knockout frequency in the population increased from 4 to 71% after Cas9-mediated selection (Fig. 6c, grey boxes). These data demonstrate that our method using Cas9 selection allows reliable generation and initial plaque isolation of a marker-free VACV in less than one week. Further, the frequency of desired recombinants after two selection steps is high enough that it would be feasible to identify these isolates directly by DNA sequencing.", "Methods": "MethodsCell lines and virusesCell lines used in this study include 293A (human embryonic kidney cells) and BS-C-1 (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells). Both lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, high glucose (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) (D10). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for the duration of experimentation.A number of VACVs were used within this study. Non-recombinant, VACV Western Reserve strain (VACV WR), was a kind gift of B. Moss, NIH. A recombinant virus possessing lacZ and mCherry gene insertions within the thymidine kinase (TK) gene was denoted VACV-mCh. This virus was generated by homologous recombination using the pSC11-mCh plasmid described below, and screened for fluorescence prior to plaque purification. VACV F5-GFP and VACV-A3-GFP have been described previously, and express eGFP fusions at the carboxy-terminus of F5 and amino-terminus of A3, respectively37,38. VACV B5-GFP has the same eGFP construct as A3, but fused to the 3′ end of gene B5R in its native location. This virus has not been described elsewhere but was made by conventional homologous recombination with a transfer plasmid by published methods61. The identity of VACV B5-GFP was verified by PCR fragment length and sequencing of the region of the genome that was manipulated. VACV infections were carried out as follows. Briefly, cells were exposed to virus diluted in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (D0) for 1 h before rescuing with 2% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM (v/v) L-glutamine-containing DMEM (D2). Virus titres were quantified by standard plaque assay on BS-C-1 cells, whereby confluent cell monolayers were infected with 10-fold serially diluted virus in D0 for 1 h, before media removal and overlay with 0.4% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose in D2. At 48–72 h post-infection (hpi), plaques were either visualised microscopically or by crystal violet staining using a 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet and 15% (v/v) ethanol fixing solution.Plasmids and single-guide RNAs (gRNAs)Four homologous recombination plasmids were used for the majority of the work in this study. Briefly, pSC11-mCh contained an mCherry gene (NCBI #MK160997.1) under the control of a p7.5 early VACV promoter, which has been inserted into a previously characterised pSC11 VACV recombination vector62,63. This backbone possesses a lacZ gene under the control of a p11 late VACV promoter and regions of homology to the TK gene of VACV64. The pSC11-Venus plasmid was created from the same backbone, but instead possesses a venus gene (NCBI #DQ092360.1) under the p7.5 promoter. pBII-ΔR was used previously to generate a recombinant VACV with a 23 kb deletion in the right arm of the genome39. In this case, recombination was utilised to replace VACV WR genes from Spi2 to C11R with mCherry. Alternatively, the pSpi2 plasmid was synthesised by Integrated DNA Technologies, and contains a modified Spi2 gene insertion in a pUCIDT-Amp commercial vector backbone. The gene insert has 500 bp homology arms which flank a region of interest in Spi2. This 20 bp sequence contains a premature stop codon at position 147, introduced EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites and bases that have been altered for evasion of recognition by the Spi2-gRNA (5′-AAAGGAGGAGAACATGGATA-3′).Other gRNA sequences used in this study include those specific to TK (TK-gRNA: 5′-TCACAGAATTCAACAATGTC-3′), mCherry (mCh-gRNA: 5′-GGATAACATGGCCATCATCA-3′), eGFP (eGFP-gRNA: 5′-GCTGAAGCACTGCACGCCGT-3′)33 and A23R (A23R-gRNA: 5′-GAAAGAACGCATTTCCTCAG-3′)33. All gRNA sequences were ordered as single RNA molecules, where the gene-specific sequence prefaced a common tracrRNA sequence (5′-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCCGTTATCAACTTGAAAAAGTGGCACCGAGTCGGTGC-3′). A list of each virus used in this study can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1.CRISPR/Cas9 transfectionsThe standard method for the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in this study followed an infection/transfection approach. Briefly, a 1 h VACV infection (MOI 0.05) preceded transfection of sub-confluent 293A cells with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and in some cases templates for homologous recombination. These pre-formed RNP complexes contained Cas9 nuclease (20 μM) lacking a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) (New England Biolabs) and 2 μg of appropriate gRNAs. Complex formation was allowed to progress for 30 min prior to transfection. All transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in D0 media for 4 h, before replacement with fresh D2 media and incubation for 48 h. At this point, wells were imaged to assess fluorescence and cells and supernatant were retained for further analysis. Virus titres and CRISPR-editing capacity were monitored using flow cytometry. Briefly, scraped cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and resuspended in 2% (v/v) FBS-containing PBS. Venus and mCherry expression, as well as cell counts were captured with an ACCURI (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Cytometry data was compiled using FlowJo software (v10.6.2). In addition, plaque assays (described above) were used to titrate viruses on BS-C-1 cells and count edited viral plaques. Note, for experiments involving recombination, plasmids were first linearised by overnight digestion and then co-transfected with the Cas9/gRNA complexes.To investigate the temporal effects of transfection and infection on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, this protocol was reversed. That is, cells were first transfected for 4 h before reagents were removed and the appropriate virus was added to cells. Again, transfection/infections were allowed to progress for 48 h.Cas9 selectionFor Cas9 selection experiments, sub-confluent 293A cells were first infected with VACV (MOI 0.05) for 1 h, then transfected with linearised plasmid alone for 24 h. Cells and supernatant were obtained as before and used to infect fresh 293A cells that had been pre-transfected with Cas9/gRNA complexes. At 48 h, this process was repeated to give a total of two rounds of CRISPR/Cas9 selection and analysed by fluorescence or PCR screening techniques. Note that at each point, virus titres were determined by plaque assay.Viral genome quantitation by qPCRTo assess genome copy numbers and relative proportions of whole and cleaved genomes, two qPCR analyses were performed using TaqMan probe chemistries. To enhance the sensitivity of these assays, the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection/infection protocol above was followed with minor changes. First, 293A cells were transfected for 4 h, as before, with pre-formed Cas9/gRNA complexes. Subsequently, infections were carried out with a higher titre of VACV-mCh virus (MOI 1) for a shorter period of time (10 min). At this point, cells were washed in PBS to remove unattached virions and re-supplied with fresh D2 media. Infections were then allowed to progress for the specified times prior to DNA extraction.For DNA isolation, cells and supernatant were collected and snap-frozen in a dry ice and ethanol bath. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) protocol was followed to retrieve DNA from each sample, the concentration of which was determined by Nanodrop (ThermoFisher) spectrophotometer analysis. For DNA standards, DNA was isolated from a sucrose cushion purified stock of VACV WR. A Qubit dsDNA BR (Broad-Range) Assay Kit and Qubit Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher) were utilised to determine the concentration of the DNA standard.For qPCR analysis, custom TaqMan Gene Expression assays were designed by ThermoFisher to analyse A23R and mCherry gene levels. Proprietary probes for these genes were complexed to FAM and VIC dyes, respectively, to facilitate multiplexing. With these pre-designed assays, 1.25 μg DNA was added to each well alongside 5 μL of TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (ThermoFisher) and 0.5 μL of the probe and primer pre-mix. All qPCRs were performed using the QuantStudio 1 (Applied Biosystems) or 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) apparatuses. The thermocycling conditions involved a 2 min, 50 °C and 10 min, 95 °C holding stage, followed by 40 cycles of 95 and 60 °C for 15 s and 1 min, respectively. Gene copy number was calculated relative to the DNA standard, whereby 10-fold dilutions of 109 VACV-mCh genomes were used to generate standard curves for A23R and mCherry. Note that calculations for the DNA concentration to genome copy number conversion were done using a known VACV WR sequence (NCBI #NC_006998).Immunofluorescence analysisTo examine viral factory formation, immunofluorescence assays were performed. 293A cells were seeded on glass coverslips that had been pre-coated with Poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 70–80% confluency, cells were transfected with the appropriate Cas9-gRNA complexes, as described above. Four hours post-transfection, media was replaced with D2 for 16 h, before infecting cells with VACV-mCh (MOI 0.5) in D2. Infections were allowed to progress for the specified times before fixation of cells in 1% (v/v) PFA. To confirm the presence of infection, fixed cells were blocked in 1% (w/v) BSA and 2% (v/v) FBS in PBS for 20 min. Samples were then probed with a rabbit anti-VACV antibody and a corresponding secondary, anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (Silenus, 1:200)37. Nucleic acids were visualised with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1:10,000). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with a mounting media containing 10% (w/v) Mowiol (Poly(vinyl alcohol)) 4–88, 25% (w/v) glycerol and 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and allowed to dry overnight prior to examination. All fixed cell imaging was conducted on the Zeiss Axio Observer wide-field microscope and the Leica SP5 confocal system.Live-cell imagingFor live-cell imaging, the IncuCyte Live Cell S3 system (Sartorius) was used. Briefly, the CRISPR/Cas9 selection protocol was followed as described above with cells at 70–80% confluency. All imaging was then conducted using the 6-well plate format, with micrographs taken at 20 min intervals from 1 to 72 hpi. During this time cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ImageJ software (v1.53) was used to annotate video files.Plaque isolation of virus and PCR screeningTo screen viral plaques in our marker-free model of CRISPR selection, we used a standard PCR screening method. Briefly, following Cas9 selection, viruses were grown on BS-C-1 cells, single plaques were identified by microscopy and cells and virus were collected with a pipette and added to D2 media for expansion before testing by PCR. This involved freeze-thawing three times, before plating these virus isolates onto uninfected BS-C-1 cells in a 96-well plate and allowing viral replication to progress for 3 days. At this point, cells were lysed by addition of proteinase K (10 μg/mL) diluted in 1X ThermoPol buffer (New England Biolabs) and PBS. Following a freeze-thaw step at −80 °C, lysates were heated at 56 °C for 20 min, then 85 °C for 10 min. DNA obtained in this manner was used as template for a PCR with insertion specific Spi2 screening primers (Spi2 screening FW: 5′-GAAGAATTCAAGCTTATGTAAAAGG-3′, Spi2 REV: 5′-CTTACATCTACCATTTCCGTCG-3′) and the presence of bands was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Spi2 PCR products were also digested overnight with HindIII to confirm the presence of the inserted 20 bp by RFLP analysis on agarose gels. Note for this experiment, PCR primers used were a FW primer specific to both wild-type and recombinant Spi2 (Spi2 sequencing FW: 5′-GTATTCATTTCTCCAGCGTCA-3′) with the Spi2 REV used above.Sanger sequencingTo sequence the Spi2 region of the VACV genome, a DNA fragment was amplified by standard PCR using the Spi2 sequencing FW and Spi2 REV primers described above. The amplified fragment was separated from the primers using agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently purified by gel extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Machery-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean Up Kit). DNA yield and purity was assessed by Nanodrop spectrophotometry (ThermoFisher). For sequencing, a 20 μL reaction containing 40 ng DNA, 1 μL BigDye Terminator (ThermoFisher), 3.2 pmol Spi2 FW sequencing primer and 3.5 µL 5X sequencing buffer. Samples were cycle sequenced at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of 96 °C (10 s), 50 °C (5 s) and 60 °C (4 min), then a 4 °C hold stage. Prior to Sanger sequencing using the AB3730 capillary sequencer, DNA was ethanol precipitated and air-dried. All sequencing was then performed by the Australian Cancer Research Foundation Biomolecular Resource Facility (BRF) at the Australian National University.Statistics and reproducibilitySample sizes were determined based on the assay. For virus plaque analysis, 30–50 plaques are considered standard for analysis. We increased this number to 100 to gain a better insight into virus frequencies within mixed populations. For flow cytometry analysis, 25,000 cells were considered sufficient per sample. All other samples were analysed in their entirety. All experiments were replicated 2–3 times independently.All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (v8.4.2) software. Typically, one- or two-way ANOVA were used with a Tukey post-test to make multiple pair-wise comparisons, or where appropriate a Student’s unpaired t-test. Unless stated otherwise error bars refer to SD.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 19089, "tokens": 2989, "source": "regular"}, "Methods": {"chars": 13528, "tokens": 2032, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Communications Biology", "year": "2020", "doi": "10.1038/s42003-020-01374-6", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

Gene sets related to mitochondrial respiration and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were markedly downregulated in the majority of the aging and disease conditions (Figure 1A; Table S1), in line with the consensus in the field (Joshi et al., 2014; Ryu et al., 2016; Short et al., 2005). Conversely, gene sets related to protein degradation, such as the UPS, and chaperone-mediated protein folding were overall upregulated across the different muscle diseases and in aging (Figure 1A). Interestingly, amyloidosis and protein-misfolding-related gene sets were among the most consistently induced in all the muscle aging and disease conditions analyzed (Figure 1A). This indicates a high similarity between aging- and disease-associated alterations of proteostasis pathways, as highlighted in the volcano plots of selected IBM and aging datasets (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S2).We then used the human Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) muscle datasets (Figure 1D; Table S3) to confirm our results generated in disease- and age-related muscle expression datasets. We separated the GTEx data based on gender and then the age of the subjects was correlated against the expression of genes. We then determined the gene sets correlating with age by using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the resulting correlation coefficients for all genes (Sergushichev, 2016). Mitochondrial and proteostasis signatures were also altered in an opposite fashion in GTEx. In agreement with the human data, we observed repression of mitochondrial pathways, mirrored by the induction of protein folding and degradation but also of aggregation and amyloid formation and regulation, in muscle expression data of mouse models of aging, proteinopathies, and dystrophy (Figure 1E; Table S1). Finally, module-module association analysis performed on 12 human muscle datasets using the genetic toolkit GeneBridge (Li et al., 2019) indicated that the amyloid-beta (Aβ) formation module has strong negative associations with respiratory electron transport and mitochondrial translation modules (Figure 1F, top), further pointing at an opposite link between mitochondrial function and amyloid pathways. Module-module association in the mouse, using 11 mouse muscle datasets, also showed similar negative associations (Figure 1F, bottom).These analyses hence suggest that there is an overall decline of mitochondrial function paired with perturbed cellular proteostasis in skeletal muscle in established proteinopathies, such as IBM, in aging, as well as in other chronic muscle conditions, including muscular dystrophies. These shared alterations, suggestive of increased protein misfolding and amyloidosis hence may represent a major common hallmark of muscle aging and disease.Muscle aging is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-like deposits across speciesSimilarly to what is observed in brain tissues affected by AD, IBM is characterized by the accumulation of well-known aggregation-prone proteins, such as Aβ peptides (Schmidt et al., 2008). One common feature of aggregation-prone proteins or peptides is their propensity to form oligomeric aggregates, which share a similar conformational status typical of amyloid aggregates (Kayed et al., 2003; Sontag et al., 2012). However, whether amyloid-based protein deposits might occur in muscle also during physiological aging across different species is yet to be defined.Based on these premises and our bioinformatic analysis pointing to the induction of amyloid-related pathways in aging and disease (Figures 1A–1E), we explored whether aging indeed correlated with the accumulation of amyloid-like aggregates in the muscle. First, we analyzed primary myoblasts obtained from 2 healthy young (18 and 25 years old) and 2 aged donors (73 and 82 years old) and from 2 IBM patients (61 years, heterozygote for a VCP mutation found in another IBM patient, Watts et al., 2004, and 73 years, sporadic case) for the presence of these aggregates, using Proteostat-based stainings (Shen et al., 2011; Figures 2A and S1A). The Proteostat dye is reactive toward intracellular aggresomes and related inclusion bodies as well as amyloid-like aggregates (Laor et al., 2019; Navarro and Ventura, 2014). Cells from aged donors showed a marked enrichment for the Proteostat signal compared to young donors (Figures 2A and S1A). These results were corroborated by the increased Proteostat signal in primary cells from IBM patients (Figures 2A and S1A). This observation is in line with our bioinformatics analysis which also indicate the induction of inclusion-bodies-related gene sets (Figures 1A, 1D, and 1E). Accordingly, protein aggregates were also detected in the murine muscle cell line C2C12, when overexpressing the amyloidogenic Swedish mutation (K595N/M596L) of human amyloid precursor protein (APPSwe) (Sorrentino et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2011; Figures 2B and S1B–S1D), along with an altered mitochondrial homeostasis typified by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 2C) and increased presence of circular mitochondria, suggestive of altered mitochondrial dynamics (Kowaltowski et al., 2019), and by impaired mitochondrial respiration (Figures S1E and S1F). We further validated our observations using the A11 anti-oligomer antibody, which is reactive toward protein aggregates of amyloidogenic nature (conformational epitope) and can be easily implemented in dot blotting assays (Condello et al., 2015; Upadhaya et al., 2012). APPSwe-expressing C2C12 accumulated amyloid deposits (2.06 relative signal compared with empty vector cells), in spite of an equal total protein amount (Figures S2A and S2B; Table S4), although negative control dot blots, performed in the presence only of the secondary antibody, did not detect aspecific signals (Figure S2C), confirming the presence of amyloid-like deposits in the APPSwe-expressing myotubes. To validate our hypothesis also in vivo, we tested muscle tissues from young (3 months) and old (2 years) C57BL/6J mice for presence of amyloid-like aggregates, via A11-immunostaining of tibialis anterioris (TA) (Figures 2D and S1G). Aged muscle displayed a marked accumulation of amyloid oligomers, and importantly, A11-positive aggregates were not detected in interstitial space (Figure S1G), in line with intracellular presence of oligomeric aggregates seen also in IBM patients (Askanas and Engel, 2011). Additionally, we also investigated protein lysates from forelimb muscles (Figures S2D–S2F; Table S4) and TA muscle of young (11 weeks), adult (30 weeks), and old (2 years or 104 weeks) mice (Figures S2G and S2H; Table S4). Both muscle groups revealed a specific, strong enrichment for the A11 signal in the old animals (104-week-old animals compared with 11-week-old mice had 1.39 increase in A11 signal in TA muscle and 6.08 increase in forelimbs). Altogether, these findings provide evidence for the occurrence of amyloid-like deposits in the aging mammalian muscle.Recently, the A11 antibody was reported to detect aging-associated aggregates also in C. elegans muscles (Alavez et al., 2011). We therefore performed A11 dot blot analyses on whole-worm protein lysates from adult (day 1) and old (day 11) wild-type N2 worms (as summarized in Figure S2I). Lysates from aged N2 showed a marked A11 enrichment compared to young worms (Figure 2E; 6.08 relative signal compared with young worms), and this signal was specifically dependent on the presence of the A11 antibody (Figures S2J and S2K; Table S4). In addition, we performed A11 dot blotting assay on the inducible muscle Aβ proteotoxicity model, GMC101 (McColl et al., 2012; day 1), whose proteostasis is hampered by the impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis induced by the RNAi depletion of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) master regulator atfs-1 (Sorrentino et al., 2017; Figure 2E). The amyloid signal, already detectable in GMC101 worms in basal conditions (Figure 2E: ev), was further enhanced by atfs-1 silencing. Aging in N2 worms also resulted in reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 2F); decreased levels of mitochondrial proteins, including the UPRmt effector, HSP-6, and certain oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) components (Figure S2L); alteration of mitochondrial networks, with the accumulation of large and circular mitochondria (Figure 2G; D’Amico et al., 2019); and in the decay of muscle structural integrity (Figure 2H).Aging is also known to be linked to a decline in NAD+ levels in muscle tissue in lower organisms and mammals (Gomes et al., 2013; Mouchiroud et al., 2013). In line with this premise and to investigate whether NAD+ homeostasis is required to maintain proteostasis, we fed C. elegans with bacteria expressing an RNAi targeting pnc-1, a key enzyme in NAD+ salvage in the nematode muscle (Vrablik et al., 2009, 2011). Genetic attenuation of pnc-1 function and NAD+ salvage exacerbated the accumulation of amyloid-like aggregates (1.98 relative signal compared with ev worms; Figures 2I and S2M). Moreover, addition of paraquat, an approach that was shown to deplete NAD+ levels and to reduce lifespan in C. elegans (Mouchiroud et al., 2013), also accelerated the loss of proteostasis in day 4 adult worms (Figures S2N and S2O). Similarly, pharmacological blocking NAD+ salvage using the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor, FK866, in APPSwe-expressing C2C12 myoblast (Hasmann and Schemainda, 2003; Oakey et al., 2019) also robustly induced protein aggregation in these amyloid-producing cells (Figure S2P), in line with that observed in nematodes. Collectively, these data confirm that the processes of amyloidosis and aging-associated loss of proteostasis are evolutionary conserved and directly linked to NAD+ homeostasis. These data furthermore suggest that these processes could be beneficially influenced by mitochondrial or NAD+-modulating interventions (Figures 2E–2I and S2M–S2P).Late-life treatment with NAD+ boosters attenuates amyloid formation and aging phenotypes in C. elegansGiven the reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction by life-extending metabolic interventions during aging (Houtkooper et al., 2013; Mouchiroud et al., 2013) and proteotoxic damage (Schöndorf et al., 2018; Sorrentino et al., 2017), the reduced Aβ aggregation and functional improvement in the context of AD following NAD+ replenishment (Gong et al., 2013; Sorrentino et al., 2017), and the increased amyloid-like deposition following NAD+ depletion (Figure 2I), we then tested the impact of the well-known NAD+ boosters nicotinamide riboside (NR) and the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib (AZD) on aging-associated amyloid formation in C. elegans. Rather than starting treatment from the embryonic stage, as commonly performed (Fang et al., 2014; Mouchiroud et al., 2013; Ryu et al., 2016), we only provided the compounds in late adulthood, allowing to bypass all the early effects due to the impact of NAD+ boosting on development and to only investigate aging-related events (Figure S3A). Treating N2 worms with NR (1 mM) starting at day 4 of adulthood (Figure S3A) induced the expression of the mitochondrial stress response (MSR) signature genes (Sorrentino et al., 2017) in day 11 old worms (Figure 3A), similar to what we previously observed in N2 or in the Aβ aggregation strain GMC101 treated from the egg stage (Sorrentino et al., 2017). Additionally, late-life treatment with either NR (1 mM) or olaparib (AZD; 300 nM) had a profound effect on proteostasis in aged worms, with amyloid-like deposits levels being reduced by both compounds (0.33 and 0.08 relative signal, respectively, compared with untreated worms; Figures 3B, S3B, and S3C; Table S4). Importantly, the NR-mediated reduction of A11-positive aggregates deposition required both atfs-1 (Nargund et al., 2012, 2015) and dct-1 (Palikaras et al., 2015; Figure 3B). This confirmed the key contribution of both the UPRmt and mitophagy pathways of the MSR to cellular proteostasis in line with our previous work on Aβ proteotoxicity (Sorrentino et al., 2017). Late-life NAD+ boosting interventions also restored mitochondrial membrane potential and muscle mitochondrial morphology in aged animals (Figures 3C, 3D, S3D, and S3E) and increased mitochondrial DNA content (Figure S3F), indicative of increased mitochondrial biogenesis. This furthermore improved fitness, measured as spontaneous movement (Mouchiroud et al., 2016; Figures 3E and S3G), muscle integrity (Figures 3F and S3H), and percentage of paralysis and death at day 18 (Figure S3I).Given the beneficial effects on proteostasis observed following boosting of mitochondrial stress responses and function, we decided to test also whether prevention of amyloid-like oligomer accumulation could have a favorable impact on muscle and mitochondrial homeostasis. To test this, we took advantage of the amyloid-binding compound thioflavin T (ThT); this dye, used to detect protein aggregates, was previously shown to reduce proteotoxicity in C. elegans during aging and in models of human proteotoxic disease (Alavez et al., 2011). The reduction in protein aggregates after ThT was concomitant with a preservation of fitness in nematodes, which is also in line with our results using NAD+ boosters, showing a simultaneous reduction of amyloid formation and increased fitness in old treated worms (Figures 3B–3F and S3B–S3H). N2 worms treated with ThT displayed a marked reduction of A11-positive protein aggregates (Figure 4A), in agreement with previous data (Alavez et al., 2011). Importantly, we also observed that ThT treatment robustly promoted mitochondrial homeostasis in aging, as shown by higher mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 4B), increased mitochondrial content (Figure 4C), and normalized muscle mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D), to a similar extent to what was observed following administration of NAD+ boosters (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3D–S3F). Collectively, these data indicate that age-associated, amyloid-like deposits likely contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in aged nematodes muscle tissue and that reducing amyloid formation can be advantageous for mitochondrial homeostasis too (Figure 4).Finally, we verified whether such late-life NAD+ boosting interventions impact mitochondrial and protein homeostasis in a corrective, rather than preventive, fashion in a severe model of inducible amyloidosis in the worm. To that end, we treated the GMC101 strain during adulthood (starting from day 1) with NR and AZD only after the induction of Aβ aggregation, achieved by shifting these worms from 20°C to 25°C at the L4 stage (McColl et al., 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2017; Figure S4A). Onset of amyloidosis in the GMC101 strain reduced worm fitness (Figure S4B) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure S4C) in line with previous work (Sorrentino et al., 2017). Moreover, amyloid aggregates accumulation in the AUW15 strain, generated from the cross of GMC101 with the SJ4103 strain expressing mitochondrial GFP in the body wall muscle, also resulted in a marked alteration of mitochondrial morphology when cultured at amyloid-promoting temperature (Figure S4D) or when compared to the strain AUW14, derived from a cross between SJ4103 and the control strain CL2122 (Sorrentino et al., 2017; Figures 5B, vehicle, and S4F, vehicle). As observed for aged N2 worms, both NR and AZD normalized the mitochondrial membrane potential (Figures 5A and S4E) and dynamics in the GMC101 worms (Figures 5B and S4F) but also reduced protein aggregation (0.18 [NR] and 0.1 [AZD] relative signal compared with untreated worms; Figure 5C; Table S4) and muscle damage (Figure 5D), whereas they improved fitness and decreased death at day 8 of adulthood (Figures 5E, S4G, and S4H).NAD+ boosting reduces amyloid formation and improves mitochondrial parameters during aging in mammalsTo translate our findings in C. elegans to mammals, we also treated primary human myotubes obtained from aged subjects and IBM patients with NR and AZD and assessed the presence of amyloid-like proteins by Proteostat staining (Figures 6A, 6B, S5A, and S5B). Importantly, both treatments decreased the amount of Proteostat-positive signal in cells derived from aged or IBM donors (Figures 6A, 6B, S5A, and S5B). Protein aggregates were also reduced in C2C12-APPSwe-expressing myotubes following these interventions, both when scored by Proteostat-based staining (Figures 6C and S5C) and A11 dot blotting (0.4 [NR] and 0.15 [AZD] relative signal compared with untreated cells; Figures S5D and S5E; Table S4). Importantly, co-treating cells with a global integrative stress response (ISR) inhibitor (ISRIB) (Sidrauski et al., 2015), attenuated the reduction in aggregates seen upon NAD+ boosting (Figure S5F). This suggests the involvement of the ISR in resolving amyloid proteotoxic stress in mammalian cells, supporting our worm data (Figure 3B). Reduction of amyloid-like deposits was mirrored by an improvement of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 6D), increased mitochondrial respiration (Figure S5G), and a more reticular mitochondrial network (Figure S5H). Together, the data in primary cells and C2C12 cells with Aβ-aggregates confirm that NAD+ boosting, in addition to its established impact on mitochondrial function, also improves proteostasis and attenuates amyloid formation in mammalian cells.Given that NR treatment in vivo beneficially impacts on mitochondrial and muscle homeostasis (including running performance), healthspan, and lifespan in adult (Cantó et al., 2012) and aged mice (Zhang et al., 2016) and reduces brain amyloid plaques in AD mice (Sorrentino et al., 2017), we assessed the effects of NR on age-associated muscle amyloid-like deposits in vivo. Dietary NR supplementation (8 weeks) consistently reduced protein deposits in TA and forelimbs muscles of old C57BL/6J mice as evidenced by A11 immunohistochemistry (Figure 6E) and dot blotting (0.45 relative signal compared to untreated animals; Figure S5I; Table S4). In agreement with our previous work (Sorrentino et al., 2017), the improved proteostasis after NR treatment was reflected by the increased expression of MSR signature genes in both young and old forelimbs tissues (Figures 6F and S5J). The expression of the OXPHOS proteins, MTCO1 and SDHB, which were decreased in aged forelimbs, was restored by NR treatment to levels similar to the ones observed in young animals (Figure 6G).To better characterize the composition of muscular age-associated amyloid-like aggregates, and given the fact that APP processing-related pathways appeared to be enriched in aging in skeletal muscle in our bioinformatic analysis (Figure 1), we verified whether APP or peptides derived from APP processing are part of the A11-positive deposits in vivo. We took advantage of the anti-Aβ 4G8 antibody, reactive also to murine endogenous APP, its cleavage products, and to Aβ (Teich et al., 2013), and stained 2 types of muscles. Similar to that observed with the A11 antibody, histology analysis of TA muscles revealed increased signals for 4G8 reactive proteins in aged animals, compared to young, which were reduced following NR treatment (Figure S6A). Accordingly, accumulation of the 4G8-dependent signal was also reduced in lysates from the forelimbs from aged animals treated with NR (Figure S6B). Although we cannot conclude which other proteins are part of these protein accumulations in aging, our data suggest that these amyloid-like deposits accumulating in aging muscles also contain APP, APP byproducts, and possibly Aβ and show that NR treatment decreases the amount of these A11- and 4G8-positive aggregates.", "STAR★Methods": "STAR★MethodsKey Resources TableResource availabilityLead contactFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Johan Auwerx (admin.auwerx@epfl.ch).Materials availabilityThe worm strains generated in this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.Data and code availabilityAll data generated during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplemental information).

Mice were fed with pellets containing vehicle or NR (400 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. The pellets were prepared by mixing powdered chow diet (2016S, Harlan Laboratories) with water or with NR dissolved in water. Pellets were dried under a laminar flow hood for 48 h. Mice were housed in groups of two to four animals per cage and randomized to 7–8 animals per experimental group according to their body weight. All experiments were performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and authorized by the local animal experimentation committee (Commission cantonale pour l’expérimentation animale) of the Canton de Vaud under license 2890.Cell cultureThe C2C12 cell line expressing the APP Swedish K670N/M671L double mutation (APPSwe) was generated in house. The pCAX APPSwe/Ind plasmid was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #30145) and the human APPSwe/Ind gene was cloned into pLX304 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Plasmid #25890) by gateway cloning. The newly generated pLX304-APPSwe/Ind vector and lentiviral plasmid packaging mix (pCMV-dR8.2 with pCMV-VSV-G) were transfected into HEK293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo, #11668019). 48 hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was collected as a source of viral particles. Then C2C12 myoblasts were infected with lentivirus-containing medium with polybrene for 24 hours. Cells were selected in 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich, #15205). The C2C12 control and APPSwe-expressing myoblast cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), penicillin-streptomycin (1x, GIBCO) at 37°C under 5% CO2. After cells reach confluence, differentiation was initiated by replacing 10% FBS to 2% horse serum. The differentiation media were changed every two days.Human primary myoblasts lines were purchased from “Hospices Civils de Lyon.” VCP IBM myoblasts were derived from a patient with heterozygote variation in the VCP gene: c.475C > T (p.Arg159Cys), previously associated with IBM in another study (Watts et al., 2004). The IBM diagnosis in the patients was validated by the “Hospices Civils de Lyon” through scores for inflammation, p62-positive aggregates in fibers and vacuoles, mitochondrial dysfunction, and indicative clinical signs. Cells were grown in DMEM/F-10, supplemented with 12% FBS (GIBCO) and penicillin–streptomycin (1 × , GIBCO). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and tested for mycoplasma using Mycoprobe (CUL001B, R&D systems).C. elegans strains and RNAi experimentsC. elegans strains were cultured at 20°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with E. coli strain OP50 unless stated otherwise. Strains used in this study were the wild-type Bristol N2, SJ4103 (myo-3::GFP(mit)), GMC101 (unc-54p::A-beta-1-42::unc-54 3′-UTR + mtl-2p::GFP) (McColl et al., 2012), CL2122 ((pPD30.38) unc-54(vector) + (pCL26) mtl-2::GFP) and RW1596 (myo-3p::GFP). Strains were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota). AUW14: (cross CL2122+SJ4103) and AUW15: (cross GMC101+SJ4103) strains were generated in house. Briefly, for the generation of these lines, SJ4103 males were generated after exposure of L4 worms to 30°C for 5.30 h, and allowed to mate with L4 hermaphrodites from CL2122 or GMC101 mutant strains. The derived progeny was selected for homozygosis of SJ4103 by the presence of GFP in body wall muscle and for homozygosis of CL2122 and GMC101 by the intestinal GFP marker for a few generations. For RNAi experiments, worms were exposed to atfs-1 and dct-1 RNAi starting from egg stage to ensure robust knock down of the investigated genes.Method detailsBioinformatics analysisHuman or mouse gene expression data from muscle aging or various muscle diseases were obtained from GEO under the respective accession identifiers (Table S1). To identify the enriched gene sets across the different conditions, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) using the fgsea package (Sergushichev, 2016). Specifically, genes were ranked based on the fold change in muscle aging or muscle diseases against controls, and enriched gene sets were determined by enrichment analysis.For the analysis using GTEx datasets (GTEx Consortium, 2013), the skeletal muscle RNA-seq data and covariates were obtained from the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org) under version v7. The expression residuals after accounting for the known and hidden covariates were used for further analysis. To identify the enriched gene sets correlated with age of the sample donors, we ranked the genes based on their Pearson correlation coefficient against age and performed GSEA to determine the enriched gene sets.The modules associated to the amyloid beta formation (GO:0034205) module were determined using muscle datasets with over 80 samples through GeneBridge at https://www.systems-genetics.org/mmad (Li et al., 2019).Imaging and image processingConfocal images were acquired with Zeiss LSM 700 Upright confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) under non-saturating exposure conditions. The worms were immobilized with 7.5 mM solution of tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in M9 and mounted on 6% agarose pads on glass slides. For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 1 × Formal-Fixx (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min. After 15 min permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were blocked in PBS supplemented with 5% FBS for 1 h and immuno-stained overnight at 4°C the anti-TOM20 antibody or stained using Proteostat. For aggregate detection with this dye, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at 21°C. Then cells were washed with PBS, followed by permeabilization for 30 min on ice using permeabilizing solution. Next, the cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated with Proteostat® dye for 30 min at 21°C. Cells were then washed with PBS, covered with glass coverslip, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Proteostat® Aggresome Detection kit (ENZ-51035-K100) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc and all components were prepared according to manufacturer’s instruction. For cell immunostaining procedures, the secondary antibody was coupled to an Alexa 488 fluorochrome (Thermo Scientific) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306). Cell slides were mounted with DAKO mounting medium (DAKO, S3023) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Image processing was performed with the Fiji software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij; version 1.47b).Mitochondrial circularityTo quantify mitochondrial morphology, we used an ImageJ macro publicly available for download from the ImageJ Wiki site (https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/morphology/mitochondrial_morphology_macro_plug-in/start) and previously validated(Dagda et al., 2009). Briefly, the color channel of cells stained with TOM20 or worms expressing mito-GFP was extracted to grayscale, inverted to show mitochondria-specific fluorescence as black pixels, and thresholded to optimally resolve individual mitochondria. The macro traces mitochondrial outlines using “analyze particles.”Gene expression analyses in C. elegans and miceTotal RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using TriPure RNA isolation reagent (Roche) according to the product manual. To analyze N2 worms at day 11 of adulthood a total of approximately 3,000 worms per condition, divided into three biological replicates, was recovered in M9 buffer from NGM plates and lysed in the TriPure RNA reagent. Each experiment was repeated twice. Total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Expression of selected genes was analyzed using the LightCycler480 system (Roche) and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master reagent (Roche). For worms two housekeeping genes were used to normalize the expression data, actin (act-1) and peroxisomal membrane protein 3 (pmp-3); for mice, the β2-microglobulin (B2m) gene was used as housekeeping reference.Pharmacological treatment of C. elegansNicotinamide riboside triflate (NR) was custom synthesized by Novalix (http://www.novalix-pharma.com/) and dissolved in water, and used at a final concentration of 1 mM. Olaparib (AZD2281) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich dissolved in DMSO to experimental concentrations of 300 nM. Thioflavin T (ThT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference T3516-5G) dissolved in methanol and used at final concentrations of 5 and 50 uM (provided from L4 stage). Paraquat was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference 856177), dissolved in water and used at final concentration of 4mM. Compounds were added just before pouring the plates. To ensure a permanent exposure to the compound, plates were changed twice a week.Worm phenotypic assaysMobilityC. elegans movement analysis started from day 6 (N2) or day 1 (GMC101) of adulthood, using the Movement Tracker software (Mouchiroud et al., 2016). The experiments were repeated at least twice.Paralysis and death score45 to 60 worms per condition were manually scored for paralysis after poking, as described (McColl et al., 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2017). Worms that were unable to respond to any repeated stimulation were scored as dead. Results are representative of data obtained from at least two independent experiments.TMRM stainingWorms were incubated 24h on NGM agar plates containing TMRM (5uM) added to the medium before pouring the plates. Before imaging, worms were washed 3 times with M9 and incubated 30 minutes on regular NGM agar plates in the dark.Phalloidin stainingA population of 100 L4 worms was incubated for 24 h at 25°C. The worms were then washed in M9 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immediately after, worms were lyophilized using a centrifugal evaporator and permeabilized using acetone. 2 U of phalloidin (Thermo Scientific) was resuspended in 20 μl of a buffer containing: Na-phosphate pH 7.5 (final concentration 0.2 mM), MgCl2 (final concentration 1 mM), SDS (final concentration 0.004%) and dH2O to volume. The worms were incubated for 1 h in the dark and then washed twice in PBS.Real-time PCR for mitochondrial:nuclear DNA ratioRelative quantification of the mtDNA copy number in worms was performed by real-time PCR. Relative values for mtce-26 and act-3 were compared within each sample to generate a ratio representing the relative level of mitochondrial DNA per nuclear genome. The results obtained were confirmed with a second mitochondrial gene, nd-1. The average of at least two technical repeats was used for each biological data point. Each experiment was performed on at least ten independent biological samples.Cell culture and treatmentsDifferentiated C2C12 cells were treated with 1uM AZD or 3mM NR in differentiation medium for 24 hours after 4 days differentiation. Human primary cells were treated with AZD or NR after 14 days myotubes differentiation. Then myotubes were collected or fixated for analysis.For TMRM staining, cells were exposed to medium containing TMRM (100 nM final) and Hoechst (5ug/mL) for 30 minutes at 37°C, then washed 3 times with PBS and imaged. Proteostat staining was performed using the manufacturer protocol.Mitochondrial oxygen consumptionMitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was evaluated using Seahorse analyzer (XF96, Agilent Technologies). OCR was measured using 1 μM of oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase, 2 μM of the protonophore Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and 1 μM rotenone/antimycin to block mitochondrial respiration and determine non‐mitochondrial OCR. ATP‐linked respiration was calculated by subtracting the uncoupled (after the addition of oligomycin) from the basal OCR. Maximum respiratory capacity was determined after FCCP addition, and spare capacity was determined by subtracting basal from the FCCP‐induced OCR. All Seahorse measurements were normalized by protein quantified by Bradford assay.Western and dot blot analysisC.elegans were lysed by sonication with TBS buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), and analyzed by western and dot blot. The concentration of extracted protein was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Membranes were blocked in 10% milk for 2h or overnight. Homogeneous loading was monitored by ponceau red. Antibody detection reactions for all immunoblot experiments were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Advansta) and imaged using the c300 imaging system (Azure Biosystems). Each immunoblot experiment was repeated at least twice using at least three biological replicates each containing approximately 1,000 worms.C2C12 cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting as for C.elegans. Each experiment was repeated at least twice using 3 biological replicates.For mouse tissues, frozen forelimbs samples were lysed by mechanical homogenization with RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for western blot analysis. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by dot blot as described for worms.HistologyTA muscles and brains were harvested from anaesthetized mice and immediately frozen in Tissue-TEK® OCT compound (PST). 8-μm cryosections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunostainings, heat activated antigen retrieval was performed in pH 6.0 citrate buffer for 10min at 95°C. After washing with PBS-0.1% tween 20 (PBST), the sections were blocked with 10% affinipure Fab goat anti mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) in PBS for 60min and PBST containing 2% BSA and 5% goat serum for 30min at room temperature. The primary anti-Oligomer A11 (Thermo Scientific, AHB0052) or anti-Aβ 4G8 (Biolegend, 800701) or laminin (Sigma, L9393) antibodies were then applied over night at 4°C. Subsequently, the slides were washed in PBST and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and labeling dyes. For immunofluorescence, secondary antibodies were coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa-568 fluorochromes (Life technology), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306). After washing in PBST, tissue sections were mounted with Dako mounting medium (Dako, S3023). Images were acquired using Leica DMI 4000 (Leica Microsystems) or Olympus Slide Scanner VS120 (Olympus) at the same exposure time. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence data was carried out by histogram analysis of the fluorescence intensity at each pixel across the images using ImageJ (Fiji; National Institutes of Health). Appropriate thresholding was employed to all the images of each single experiment to eliminate background signal in the images before histogram analysis. Fluorescence intensity and signal positive areas were calculated using the integrated “analyse particles” tool of the Fiji software.Quantification and statistical analysisNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Differences between two groups were assessed using two-tailed t tests. Differences between more than two groups were assessed by using two-way ANOVA. Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses. Variability in all plots and graphs is presented as the s.e.m. All p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001 unless stated otherwise. All mouse experiments were performed once. Animals that showed signs of severity, predefined by the animal authorizations were euthanized. These animals, together with those who died spontaneously during the experiments, were excluded from the analysis. These criteria were established before starting the experiments. For motility, fitness, and death scoring in C. elegans, sample size was estimated based on the known variability of the assay. All experiments were done non-blinded and repeated at least twice.", "Experimental model and subject details": "Experimental model and subject detailsAnimal experiments and ethical approvalMale 24 months old C57BL/6JRj mice were purchased from Janvier Labs.

For RNAi experiments, worms were exposed to atfs-1 and dct-1 RNAi starting from egg stage to ensure robust knock down of the investigated genes."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 20192, "tokens": 2959, "source": "regular"}, "STAR★Methods": {"chars": 16619, "tokens": 2387, "source": "regular"}, "Experimental model and subject details": {"chars": 3778, "tokens": 555, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Cell Reports", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108660", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}
{"protocol_id": "Bio-protocol-4244", "pmcid": "PMC7903996", "domain": "Pharmacology & Drug Development", "title": "Smoking flies: testing the effect of tobacco cigarettes on heart function of Drosophila melanogaster", "xml_path": "data/gold/pmc_jats/PMC7903996.xml", "sections": {"RESULTS": "RESULTSAdult flies housed in a container were exposed to commercial cigarette smoke originated with the aid of a custom device (Fig. 1). The procedure was adapted from a previous study from our group, in which we exposed the flies to vaporized compounds (Gomez et al., 2019). In the present setup, we replaced the vaporizer in the device with a cigarette. By means of a three-way stopcock manifold, smoke was suctioned from the cigarette using a syringe. Afterwards, it was transferred into a vial containing only the flies to be treated. The temperature inside the vial receiving the smoke coming from the cigarette was measured with a probe in order to verify that vial's temperature (room temperature) was not altered during exposition (data not shown). Compounds were up taken through and distributed by the tracheal ramifications of the flies, eventually reaching the hemolymph. Although it is a passive process, we defined it as inhalation. We then analyzed the cardiac performance of Drosophila under exposure to cigarette smoke, assessing the parameters associated to the Ca2+i handling. Adult flies (3 days old) were submitted to inhalation of cigarette smoke for 7 days. We tested Phillip Morris® cigarettes, which contain 0.7 mg of nicotine. Two diary doses of 10 cc of smoke were provided and flies were kept in contact with the smoke for 5 min. Subsequently, they were transferred to their vial with food.After 7 days of smoke exposure, adult flies were euthanized and dissected in order to prepare the semi-intact fly preparation, containing the intact beating heart immersed in artificial hemolymph. This preparation was placed in a confocal microscope in order to assess intracellular calcium transients by means of a genetically-encoded fluorescent reporter system targeted to cardiac cells (Santalla et al., 2014).Exposure to cigarette smoke incremented the heart rate and reduced the amplitude of the calcium transients (Fig. 2A and B). This was accompanied by an increment of the maximal velocities of contraction and relaxation (+dF/dt, −dF/dt) (Fig. 2C and D). Time to peak (TTP) of contraction did not show a significant decrease although the half-relaxation time (t1/2) showed a faster relaxation (Fig. 2E and F). Diastolic intervals and heart rate variability (AI) did not shown differences (Fig. 2G,H). In an attempt to elucidate whether nicotine, the relevant component of tobacco cigarettes, is responsible for the observed changes on heart parameters in smoke-exposed flies, we designed a new set of experiments. Nicotine was applied on semi-intact preparation of adult, 7-day-old flies submerged on artificial hemolymph to monitor the activity of the beating heart. Video recording was carried out for a 1 min period. After the first 20 s, nicotine was added to the artificial hemolymph to a final concentration of 1.69×10−3 M. The addition of nicotine incremented the heart rate and accelerated the maximal velocities of contraction and relaxation (Fig. 3A,C,D). These results are consistent with the changes observed in flies chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. Although the calcium transient amplitude shows a tendency to decrease, it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained measurement time to peak (TTP) (Fig. 3E). In addition, nicotine-treated flies exhibited a faster half-relaxation time (Fig. 3F). Altogether, these results suggest that nicotine may play a role in cardiac performance under exposure to this substance. Then, we explored the relevance of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the effects observed under cigarette exposure. nAChRs are present in vertebrate and invertebrate species. In insects, nAChRs are normally activated by the endogenous ligand, acetylcholine, and these receptors are the site of action of commercially important insecticides such as neonicotinoids (Jones et al., 2007). It has been described that Drosophila melanogaster has ten nAChR subunits, namely Dα1-Dα7 and Dβ1-Dβ3 (Lansdell et al., 2012).First, we studied alpha 1 subunit. An interfering microRNA specific for the alpha 1 subunit transcripts was specifically expressed in heart cells, under the tinC driver. Adult flies of the same age were divided into two groups immediately after emerging of the puparium. Flies from one group were exposed to commercial cigarette smoke for 7 days and compared to control group of flies (exposed to ambient air). Downregulation of the alpha 1 subunit of AChRs abolished the impact of smoke on the calcium dynamic, revealed by the absence of change in the maximal velocity of relaxation (-dF/dt), time to peak of contraction and half-relaxation time with respect to the control group (Fig. 4D–F). Unlike wild-type flies, the maximal velocity relaxation (+dF/dt) was reduced (Fig. 4C). However, heart rate was increased and the amplitude of calcium transients was diminished (Fig. 4A,B). Under tobacco smoke exposure, the diastolic interval shows a reduction in concordance with increased heart rate. This was accompanied by a higher variability of heart rate, expressed as arrythmia index (Fig. 4G,H). These results suggest that alpha 1 subunit could be relevant on calcium transient dynamics but without any relevance on heart rate or calcium transient amplitude induced by tobacco cigarettes. Semi-intact preparations of transgenic flies with downregulated alpha 1 gene were not responsive to nicotine exposure (Fig. 5A–F). The increase in heart rate and calcium transient amplitude reduction observed after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke was not evident under acute nicotine challenge (Fig. 5A,B). This would suggest that other components of tobacco cigarette might be affecting the cardiac performance. The next step was to study the alpha 7 subunit involvement on cardiac performance when fly hearts were exposed to smoke or pure nicotine. The gene encoding the alpha 7 subunits in Drosophila (Dα7) is one of the genes with the highest homology to those from vertebrates (Grauso et al., 2002).In contrast to wild-type and alpha 1-downregulated Drosophila melanogaster, flies carrying the iRNA (expressed under the cardiac-specific promotor TinC) targeted to the alpha-7 subunit of AChR did not exhibit increased heart rate when exposed to cigarette smoke (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained for the diastolic intervals and AI (Fig. 6G,H). However, most of the analyzed parameters, i.e. the calcium transient, maximal velocity of relaxation, time to peak and time to half relaxation showed significant changes when flies were exposed to cigarette smoke respect to control flies (Fig. 6B–F). These results suggest that alpha 7 subunits are not essential mediators of cigarette impact on these cardiac calcium transient parameters regulation. Another set of experiments testing the action of nicotine in these alpha 7-downregulated transgenic flies, showed that cardiac parameters are not significantly different respect to the control group (Fig. 7A–F). Therefore, alpha 7 subunit would be part of the underlying mechanism that mediates the response to nicotine exposure but no to other components present in tobacco cigarettes. In summary, alpha 1 and 7 subunits would participate in the nicotine-associated effects on cardiac performance. Interestingly, alpha 1 subunit, but not alpha 7, would play a role associated to response to non-nicotine components of tobacco cigarettes.Our results demonstrate that cardiac specific expression of microRNA targeted to alpha 1 or alpha 7 subunits of nAChRs modifies the response to smoke exposure from commercial cigarettes and abolishes the response to nicotine in semi-intact preparation of fly's heart. This suggests that both subunits are part of receptor structures which might be present in nervous terminal and/or in cardiac tissue, modulating the effect of nicotine on cardiac performance.", "MATERIALS AND METHODS": "MATERIALS AND METHODSDrosophila strainsAll fly stocks were housed, grown and bred at 25°C on standard cornmeal-yeast medium.To evaluate cardiac calcium handling a strain carrying the heart-specific reporter system TinC- Gal4-UAS-GCaMP3 (called GCaMP3) was used (Lin et al., 2011).Transgenic flies that expressed iRNA targeted to the alpha 1 and 7 subunits of the nicotine receptor under UAS sequence (BDSC_28688 and BDSC_51049) (Perkins et al., 2015) were crossed with flies harbouring the reporter system UAS-GCaMP3 and the Gal4 activator under the control of heart-specific promoter, tinC. Heterozygous individuals of F1 progeny were grown at 25°C. Progeny resulting from Canton-S crossed with flies harbouring the reporter system was used as control in order to evaluate the iRNA effects in the same genetic background of the reporter system.Commercial cigarette smoke administrationBy means of a homemade device (Gomez et al., 2019), two doses of 10 cc of commercial cigarette smoke (composition in mg for each cigarette: 10 tar, 0.7 nicotine and 10 carbon monoxide) were administered daily for 7 days starting on day 3 after hatching. Flies were exposed to the tobacco smoke for 5 min each time at an interval of 6 h. Afterwards, the flies were dissected and hearts were used for assessing intracellular calcium handling.Acute administration assays: pulse of nicotineIn order to assess if one of the main components of commercial cigarettes, nicotine, was responsible for the effects associated with the administration of tobacco smoke, nicotine was added to the hemolymph (final concentration of 1.69 mM in the preparation).Semi-intact preparation was mounted in a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss 410) and the fluorescent signal of the calcium sensitive reporter was recorded for 30 s. Next, nicotine was added to the preparation and calcium signal was immediately recorded for the following 30 s.Heart dissectionHearts were dissected and prepared as described by Santalla et al. (2014). Briefly, adult flies were anaesthetized with CO2, and thorax and legs were removed from the fly. Flies were bathed in oxygenated hemolymph buffer (in mM, 108 NaCl, 5 KCl, 8 MgCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 4 NaHCO3, 5 HEPES, pH 7.1, 10 sucrose, 5 trehalose and 2 CaCl2) (Vogler and Ocorr, 2009; Santalla et al., 2014; Balcazar et al., 2018) at room temperature. After dissection, semi-intact preparations of adult hearts were maintained for 40–45 min. In cases in which this procedure might take longer time for analysis, other hemolymph preparations have been shown to be useful to preserve the physiological states of the organ (de Castro et al., 2014, 2019).Functional analysisBeating hearts from semi-intact preparations were observed under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss 410), and changes in GCaMP3 fluorescence in the first cardiac chamber (conical chamber) were recorded. Transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that precedes cardiac contraction was detected as a fluorescent signal. Measurements included: Ca2+ transient amplitude (ΔF/F0, expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence, AU), maximal rates of increasing and decreasing fluorescence (+dΔF/F0/dt) (in AU/second), (−dΔF/F0/dt) (in AU/second), time to peak of Ca+2 transient (TTP) (seconds) and half-relaxation time t1/2 (seconds). Number of fluorescent events per minute were counted to obtain heart rate, and the diastolic periods (stable fluorescent signal between calcium transients) were measured. Arrhythmicity index (AI) was calculated as the standard deviation of periods (time between maximal fluorescence of consecutive beats) normalised by their average (Balcazar et al., 2018).Statistical analysisAll results from functional analyses of calcium handling were expressed as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was made by comparisons using Student’s t-test paired for acute assays (application of nicotine pulse to the fly preparation). Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparisons of the effects of commercial cigarette among different individuals. P-values<0.05 were considered statistically significant."}, "stats": {"RESULTS": {"chars": 7878, "tokens": 1198, "source": "regular"}, "MATERIALS AND METHODS": {"chars": 4081, "tokens": 596, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "Biology Open", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1242/bio.055004", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}

To test whether the function of N could be complemented in trans, we constructed SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome, in which we replaced the regions encoding viral N (from nucleotides position 28274 to 29533) based on MN908947 genome with GFP reporter gene, and Caco-2 cells, an immortalized cell line of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, as packaging cell lines which stably express viral N protein by lentiviral transduction (Fig 1).To assemble the molecular clone of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome, we utilized an in vitro ligation approach, which has been used for constructing the infectious clone of SARS-CoV-2[11,12]. We divided the full-length cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome into a set of five fragments (A, B, C, D and E) and each fragment can be obtained by PCR using the chemically synthesized viral genome (MN908947 strain) as the template. Each DNA fragment was flanked by a type IIS restriction endonuclease site (BsaI or BsmBI) that ensures unidirectional assembly of intermediates into a full-length cDNA. In addition, we engineered a T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase promoter (T7 promoter) upstream of fragment A and a poly(A) tails at the downstream of fragment E, allowing for in vitro transcription of capped, polyadenylated transcript of viral genome (Fig 1A).The five PCR-amplified DNA fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI to generate specific sticky ends (Fig 1B). The digested fragments were further purified and were ligated by T4 DNA ligase at 4°C to generate the full-length cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome. The resulting 29.4-Kbp in vitro ligation products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig 1C). Next, this in vitro ligation products were used as the template for in vitro transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase to generate the RNA transcript of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome (Fig 1D).Recovery and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLPCaco-2 cells are highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN virus like particles, lacking N gene, could potentially propagate in the cells supplied with viral N protein in trans, we established the Caco-2 cells stably expressing viral N gene by lentiviral transduction (designated as Caco-2-N cells). The expression of N was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting assay (Figs 1E, S1A and S1B).Next, we sought to recover SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP, the in vitro transcribed RNA transcript of viral genome was electroporated into Caco-2-N cells. Within 48h, GFP fluorescence can be readily observed, suggesting that viral genome replication and transcription occurs in the cell. After 96h, cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in the electroporated Caco-2-N cells, suggesting that the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP was produced and propagated (S2 Fig). We collected the cell culture supernatants (denoted as passage 0 (P0) virus), and inoculated them to Caco-2 or Caco-2-N cells (Fig 2A). GFP signal can be readily observed within 48 h, and further expanded within 72 h in Caco-2-N cells, whereas no signal was detected in Caco-2 cells (Fig 2B). Cells were collected for immunoblotting and RT-qPCR analysis at 72 h post-infection to detect viral spike antigen and RNA abundance. Consistent with the GFP expression, we could detect viral spike expression and high abundance of viral RNA in the Caco-2-N cells but not in Caco-2 cells (Fig 2C and 2D). RT-PCR analysis using a primer set outside the N-encoding region confirmed that the N gene was indeed replaced by GFP in the recombinant trVLP viral genome (Fig 2E).To characterize the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP infection, two spike-specific mAbs (1F11 and 2F6)[13] were tested for their ability to neutralize infection of Caco-2-N cells. A neutralizing mAb specific for HIV gp120 (VRC-01) was also included as the control[14]. The mAbs were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP for 1 h at 37°C, and the trVLP–mAb mixtures were tested for infection of Caco-2-N cells, respectively. Viral infection was determined by flow cytometry at 48 h post-infection, and the results showed that 1F11 and 2F6 inhibited trVLP infection in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, VRC01 had no effect on the trVLP infection (Fig 2F).Soluble recombinant forms of the human ACE2 are able to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and inhibit its interaction with cellular ACE2[15,16]. We therefore tested the ability of mouse IgG Fc fusion proteins of soluble human ACE2 (D30E) (hACE2 (D30E)-Fc)[16] to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP infection. F10scFv, an antibody specifically targeting HA of the Influenza A virus, was used as a negative control. The hACE2 (D30E)-Fc trVLP showed a dose-dependent neutralization of infectivity, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN infection of Caco-2-N cells by 70% at 0.5μg/ml (Fig 2G). Together, these data demonstrated that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP recapitulates that of wild-type virus as its virus entry is also mediated by the interaction between viral spike and host ACE2.Characterization of the genetic stability of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLPNext, we sought to characterize the genetic stability of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP. For this purpose, we analyzed the rescued SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP in Caco-2-N cells after 10 passages. The cell culture supernatants collected from SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN RNA electroporated Caco-2-N cells were defined as P0, and the cell cultures collected from each subsequent passage on the Caco-2-N cells were defined as P1 to P10, respectively. The total RNAs extracted from each cell passage were used to perform RT-PCRs with the pair of primers to amplify the fragment between ORF8 and 3’UTR that covers the region of the inserted GFP reporter gene (Fig 3A). RT–PCR products of 1.5-Kbp and 1-Kbp were expected for WT genome and SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP was considerably stable for at least 3 serial passages since the 1-Kb RT–PCR products were detected at P3 trVLP (Fig 3B). The loss of GFP reporter gene was detected in the P4 trVLP as indicated by amplicon of < 1 Kb size (Figs 3B and S3A). No PCR product of greater than 1 Kb was detected in the all samples, suggesting that no heterologous RNA inserted into the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome, at least in the GFP report region.To characterize the trVLP sequence variations in an unbiased manner, we performed deep sequencing analysis on the P1 and P10 trVLP genomes. The deep sequencing analysis provides deep coverage, on the order of 30 million reads per sequencing sample (S3B Fig). Sequences of P1 or P10 were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP genomes, respectively (Fig 3C and 3D) and relative abundances of these sequences between P1 and P10, were also compared (Figs 3E and S3C). The deep sequencing analysis could not detect N sequences in the both P0 and P10 genomes (Fig 3C), and GFP sequences were readily detected in the P1 genome with high abundance, however, it was rarely detected in the P10 genome (Fig 3D), due to GFP sequences deletion (Figs 3B and S3A). Additionally, we found that the subgenomic RNAs of ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8 were dramatically decreased in the P10-trVLP infected cells compared with that of P1 VLP (Fig 3E), indicating that ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8 might be dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 after its adaptation into Caco-2 in vitro, this observation is consistent with other reports that deletions of these regions were observed in clinical samples by deep sequencing analysis[17–20].Reconstitution of functional N protein by split intein-mediated protein ligationInteins are intervening protein sequences within a host protein that mediate their self-excision from the precursor protein and ligates the flanking N- and C-terminal fragments (exteins)[21]. Split inteins are a subset of inteins that are expressed as two separate polypeptides at the ends of two host proteins and catalyze their trans-splicing, resulting in the generation of a single larger polypeptide (Fig 4A). To further minimize the chance of recombination of N into the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome, we aimed to split the N gene into two separate elements using a naturally split intein embedded within the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III (DnaE) in many species of cyanobacteria (Npu intein)[22]. Npu intein activity is context-dependent, and Cys as first residue in the C-extein is required for efficient trans-splicing. However, there is no Cys residue in SARS-CoV-2 N protein. In order to split the N, we had to find the appropriate splice sites that would have two well-folded, yet stable protein fragments, and also substitute first residue in the C-extein with Cys without disruption of N protein function. To locate the splice sites according to these requirements we chose three splice sites in the N protein, to have the N-intein A152C, S176C and G212C (Fig 4A). As for each of N-intein above, we constructed two lentivirus vectors encoding either the N- or the C-terminal half of the N protein fused to the N- and C-terminal halves of the Npu intein, having NN-IntN and IntC-NC, respectively (Fig 4A). Each lentivirus vector included appropriate regulatory elements (promoter and a polyadenylation signal) and a Flag tag to allow detection of the full-length reconstituted N protein (Fig 4A). We then transduced NN-IntN and IntC-NC either individually or together in Caco-2 cells, and the full-length N protein reconstitution was assessed by Western blotting assay. We could not detect splicing above negligible levels of N protein by N-intein (A152C) (lane 2, Fig 4B), while N-intein (S176C) and N-intein (G212C) could reconstitute into full-length N protein with S176C or G212C point mutation, respectively (lane 5 and 8, Fig 4B). Next, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP (P1) was inoculated to Caco-2 cells transduced with N-intein as indicated, and GFP fluorescence was detected after two days only in the cells transduced either with a single lentivirus that encodes full-length N or with the combination of N-intein (G212C), but not in the cells with the single N- and C-terminal N-intein (G212C). As expected, GFP fluorescence was also not detected in cells transduced with N-intein (A152C), of which the splicing did not occur; interestingly, N-intein (S176C) could ligate a full-length N (S176C), but fails to support virus infection, suggesting that the S176C mutation probably impairs N protein function (Fig 4C and 4D). Consistent with the GFP expression, the subgenomic RNA of E can be readily detected in cells transduced either with a single lentivirus that encodes full-length N or with the combination of N-intein (G212C), but not others (Fig 4E). Together, we showed that the N-intein (G212C) was capable of efficiently trans-splicing to generate a functional N (G212C) protein to support SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP infection. As the N-intein was split into separate constructs, it would further reduce the potential biosafety concerns of this SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP cell culture model. Notably, G212C is closed to the incidences of R203K/G204R[23], and it is required to be further validated the ligation and function of N (R203K/G204R)-intein (G212C).Residue-specific phosphorylation of N protein is critical for viral infectivityCoronavirus N protein is an extensively phosphorylated, highly basic, vital structural protein and the primary function of which is to form a helical ribonucleoprotein complex with viral RNA (RNP) as core structure of the virion. A variety of other functions have been ascribed, such as viral genome transcription and replication, or evasion of antiviral immunity. SARS-CoV-2 N protein is highly homologous to the N protein of SARS-CoV, with 91% identity, while exhibited 48% identity with that of MERS-CoV (Fig 5A). Several proteomics profiling analyses have been performed and reveal that N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is extensively phosphorylated at multiple sites (Figs 5A and S4). However, the roles of N protein phosphorylation remain unclear. Our N-based genetic trans-complemented cell culture model offers an opportunity to specifically study N protein function in viral life cycle. Firstly, we determined whether SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP infection can be complemented by N proteins from different coronavirues. We used SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP to infect the Caco-2 cells transduced with N from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Two days later, the cell culture supernatants from each cells were collected to infect Caco-2 cells transduced with SARS-CoV-2N (Caco-2-N cells as previously used) to test whether SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP were assembled in the Caco-2 cells transduced with distinct N proteins. Two days later, the Caco-2-N cells were collected and GFP or viral RNA was quantified by flow cytometry or RT-qPCR, respectively (Fig 5B and 5C). SARS-CoV N protein with 91% identity with that of SARS-CoV-2, but not MERS-CoV N protein with 48% identity with that of SARS-CoV-2, could rescue SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP (Fig 5D and 5E), suggesting that coronavirus N protein has virus-specific mechanism to recognize viral genome to achieve its function, meanwhile, N proteins from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, with high genetic similarity, have redundant function to some degree.As SARS-CoV-2 N is heavily phosphorylated at multiple sites especially within the central Ser-Arg (SR)-rich motif, we are interested in the roles of phosphorylation in N function. For this purpose, we mutated S176, S413, S176/413, S105, S183, S188, S206, S188/206 as the conservation of these residues with that of SARS-CoV into alanine to specifically dissect their function. Notably, GSK-3 is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of this SR-rich motif in SARS-CoV N protein, which are primed by the phosphorylation of Ser-189 and Ser-207 (Ser-188 and Ser-206 in SARS-CoV-2 N protein accordingly)[24,25]. We generated the Caco-2 cells lentivirally transduced with the N variants as indicated. As shown in Western blotting assay, the mutations did not alter the protein expression and stability in the Caco-2 cell (Fig 5F), We noted that N with the S188A/S206A double mutations migrated slightly faster than WT and other mutants, probably because blockade of the initial priming phosphorylation would prohibit subsequent phosphorylation events by GSK-3, which was observed in SARS-CoV [24]. Next, we inoculated the Caco-2 cells expressing different N variants with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP, and cell culture supernatant was collected 48 h later to infect the naïve Caco-2-N cells, and cells were collected to observe or determine GFP expressing by microscopy or flow cytometry 2 days later. Interestingly, most of the phosphorylation null mutants were able to assemble virus-like particles with comparable or slightly reduced efficiencies than WT. However, S188A/S206A double mutations completely abolished N function (Fig 5G and 5H), highlighting the critical role of S188 and S206 for N function.To further investigate whether GSK-3 contributing N protein phosphorylation to regulate virus life cycle, we treated Caco-2-N cells with LiCl or SB216763, which are specific inhibitors of GSK-3 and inoculated cells with SARS-CoV-2 trVLP spontaneously. Two days later, cell culture medium was collected and infect Caco-2-N cells for additional 2 days, and then cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression. As expected, the LiCl or SB216763 could inhibit GFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that inhibition of GSK-3 could block N phosphorylation, thus impairing SARS-CoV-2 trVLP production. Given the vital role of the N protein in multiple stages of the viral life cycle, inhibition of N functions by modulating host cell kinases may be viable strategies for combating SARS-CoV-2 infections.Evaluation of the antivirals using SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN VLP cell culture modelTo test the utility of this system in anti-viral drug screening, we evaluated the efficacy of IFN-β, remdesivir, GC376, lopinavir, and ritonavir in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP infection. Caco-2-N-intein (G212C) cells were treated with IFN-β with 0.2–20 pg/ml for eight hours prior to infection. Then cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. After 48 h, the cells were collected and GFP fluorescence, the proxy of virus infection, was quantified by flow cytometry analysis. Remarkably, even at 0.2 pg/ml IFN-β we observed 60% reduction of the GFP fluorescence (Fig 6A). This is consistent with recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I interferon treatment[11,26–28]. Remdesivir and GC376, which target virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3CLpro respectively, have been reported to be potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2[29–33]. Lopinavir and ritonavir-HIV protease inhibitor, is a combination antiviral medicine used to treat HIV[34], which could inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in vitro, and they may target SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 (3CLpro) to inhibit virus infection. To test potential dose-dependent antiviral activity of those drugs in our system, we incubated Caco-2-N-intein (G212C) cells with various concentrations of those drugs and simultaneously infected the cells with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP at a MOI of 0.05. After 2 days, GFP fluorescence was determined (Fig 6B-6E). Remdesivir and GC376 exhibited potent antiviral effect with IC50 = 62.5 nM and 4.5 μM respectively, with essentially no apparent cytotoxic effect (Fig 6B and 6C). In contrast, Lopinavir or ritonavir inhibited SARS-CoV-2-GFP/ΔN trVLP with IC50 = 8.7 μM, or 7.7 μM, while those drugs both show serious cytotoxicity at the IC50 concentration (Fig 6D and 6E), compromising their clinical utilities, which is in line with the fact that lopinavir and ritonavir as no significant beneficial effect was observed in a randomized trial established in March 2020 with a total of 1,596 patients[35].These results demonstrated that our experimental system can be used for evaluation of antivirals and could be potentially developed for high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds.Identification of potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 virus using trVLP cell culture model by high-throughput screeningTo provide proof-of-concept that our system could be utilized in high-throughput screening, we performed HTS of Topscience natural product library containing 377 drugs (Fig 7A) and the potential hit compounds were further assessed using authentic SARS-CoV-2 to confirm the antiviral activities in vitro. DMSO or remdesivir were included as the negative or positive control.Among the 377 compounds of the compound library, 10 hit molecules showed equal or higher inhibition with an inhibitory efficiency ≥ 60% (Fig 7A). In addition, we excluded five hits due to the visible cytotoxicity. This criterion allowed the selection of five hits as the highest confident hits: salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium (Fig 7A). Among these five compounds, lycorine chloride, salinomycin and monensin sodium inhibit HCoV-OC43 infection as previously reported[36] and monensin sodium blocks avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection[37]. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that salinomycin possessed a potent antiviral activity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro[38], which further demonstrated that our system could be used for HTP antiviral screening. We next determined the IC50 of the hit compounds using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Salinomycin showed SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity with an IC50 and CC50 of 2.836 and 20.23 μM, respectively, and selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of 7.13. In comparison, other four compounds did not show dramatic cytotoxic effect in the tested concentrations. Of note, tubeimosde I exhibited an IC50 of 1.371 μM; monensin sodium exhibited an IC50 of 0.632 μM; lycorine chloride showed antiviral activity with an IC50 of 0.773 μM, and nigericin sodium, exhibited an IC50 of 11.25 μM. These results demonstrated that the compounds we identified using SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP system exhibited potent antiviral activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and our screening provided new candidate compounds to effectively treat infection of SARS-CoV-2.", "Materials and methods": "Materials and methodsCell cultureHEK293T, Vero, Vero E6, A549 and Caco-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, China) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 50 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator at 37°C. All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma.Cloning of the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAcDNAs (Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) of SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN were synthesized from the GenScript company (the N gene is replaced with gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP)). PCR was conducted to amplify fragments A, B, C, D and E using high fidelity PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara). T7 promoter was introduced upstream of 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genome in fragment A. To guarantee a seamless assembly of the full-length cDNA, type IIS restriction endonuclease sites (BsaI or BsmBI) were introduced at both ends of PCR fragments. The primers used for the PCR assay were listed in S1 Table.Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN cDNAPCR fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) to get specific sticky end. Digested fragments are purified by E.Z.N.A gel extraction kit (Omega). Fragment A, B are ligated first by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in 40μl system. At the same time, fragments C, D, E are also ligated in another tube at 4°C for 24 hours. Then, fragment A, B and C, D, E are combined together added with 2μl T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2μl T4 DNA ligase to 100μl at 4°C for another 24 hours. At the end of ligation, we took 5μl product to run an agarose gel to check the efficiency of ligation. Full-length assembly cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, isopropanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10μL nuclease-free water.

Twenty micrograms of viral RNA and 20μg N mRNA were mixed and added to a 4-mm cuvette containing 0.4 mL of Caco-2-N cells (8×106) in Opti-MEM. Single electrical pulse was given with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with setting of 270V at 950μF. GFP signal can be observed 17 hours post electroporation. Three days post electroporation, P0 virus was collected and Caco-2-N cells were infected with P0 virus to amplify virus.Lentivirus packagingVesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced by transient cotransfection of the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog number 12260; Addgene) and the transfer vector pLVX by VigoFect DNA transfection reagent (Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection. Supernatants were collected at 36, 60 and 84 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C refrigerator.RNA isolation and RT-qPCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo, 15596018). To analyze the RNA level of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. In brief, 1μg total RNA was reverse transcribed using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-101) to produce cDNA with random primers. Reactions of qPCR were carried out using the 2×RealStar Green Power Mixture (Genstar, A311) according to the instruction. The qPCR primers for viral RNA were as follows: THU-2190 (5’- CGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCC-3’) and THU-2191 (5’- TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3’). The sequences of the qPCR primers for GAPDH was described previously[44]. Relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. All data were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.RNA-seq and data analysisTotal RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The rRNAs were removed by using Ribo-Zero Gold module of Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA library prep kit (RS-122-2201) and then cDNA libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq was performed by using the Illumina Novaseq platform. The reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947) was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore /MN908947. After removing low-quality reads, remaining Illumina sequence reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) and SARS2 genome by using HISAT2.1.0 with parameters:—rna-strandness RF–dta. RNA-seq coverage was visualized by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). To quantify the expression levels of SARS2 genes, RPKM of each virus genes and GFP gene were calculated. Heatmaps were drawn by using R package “pheatmap” (https://www.r-project.org). To quantify the junction-reads from subgenomic RNAs, the STAR2.7.5c was used for reads mapping. The junction-reads was defined and collected as described[45]. A Sankey diagram was drawn by using R packages named “networkD3” and “dplyr”.IFN-β, neutralizing antibody and drug treatmentTo assess the antiviral efficacies of the materials, 1×104 Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 GFPΔN virus at MOI of 0.05. For neutralizing antibody treatment, virus was incubated with neutralizing antibody for 1 hour at 37°C before infection. For IFN-β (Sino Bioligical, 10704-HNAS-5) test, cells were pre-treated with IFN-β for 8 hours before infection. For remdesivir (MedChemExpress, HY-104077), lopinavir (biochempartner, BCP01395) or ritonavir (biochempartner, BCP03777) treatment, drugs were added simultaneously upon infection. Two days after infection, flow cytometry was performed to analyze GFP positive rate. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50; compound concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% reduction of GFP positive cells) were determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Cell viability assayCaco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plate (1×103 cells/well). After 12 hours, cells were treated with drugs with different concentrations. Cell viability was measured two days post treatment with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7570) following standard protocol. In brief, cells in 100 μl culture medium were added with 100 μl CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 15 minutes, luminescence was recorded with GloMax (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.Flow cytometry analysisCells were detached in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA and then washed once with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRFortessa SORP (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.Western blottingSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting was conducted as follows: After trypsinization and cell pelleting at 1500 r/m for 10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked at room temperature for 0.5 h using 5% nonfat milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-N (05–0154, AbMax), S (40589-T62, Sino Biological), β-Tubulin (CW0098, CWBIO), Flag (F7425, Sigma), ACE2 (10108-T24, Sino Biological) in 5% nonfat milk in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were then washed in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After 1h exposure to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent washes were performed as described for the primary antibodies. Membranes were visualized using the Luminescent image analyzer (GE).Antiviral screeningTwelve hours prior to infection for the antiviral screening 5 × 104 Caco-2-Nint cells were seeded in 96 well plates. The next day, a single dilution of each compound of the Topscience Natural Product Library at 5 μM final concentration was added to the cells (50 μL/well). DMSO or remdesivir (3.5μM) were included in each plate as the internal control. After 2 hours, 50 μL of virus was added to the wells at MOI 0.05. Two days after infection, cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis to determine the GFP expression.Evaluation of antiviral activity using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virusA549 cells stably expressing human ACE2 were seeded in a 96-well plate (4×104 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with drugs (Lycorine chloride (TargetMol, T2774), Tubeimoside I (TargetMol, T2715), Nigericin sodium (TargetMol, T3092), Monensin sodium (MedChemExpress, HY-N0150), Salinomycin (MedChemExpress, HY-15597)) of different concentration for 2 hours prior to infection. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS culture medium for 24 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1 μg/ml) at 4°C overnight. After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo #A32732, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by staining with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an Operetta High Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). For high content imaging, two biological replicates for each concentration of drug were scanned and five representative fields were selected for each well of 96-well plates. Image analysis was performed using the PerkinElmer Harmony high-content analysis software 4.9. Cells were automatically identified by DAPI (nuclei). Mean fluorescent intensity of channel Alexa 555 (viral nucleocapsid) of each cell were subsequently calculated, respectively. For the 0% inhibition control, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in N protein expression. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the dose-response (variable slope) equation (four parameter logistic equation).SARS-CoV-2 infection and biosafetyThe SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-SH01 (GenBank accession no. MT121215) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and propagated in Vero E6 cells for use. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of Tsinghua University has approved the SARS-CoV-2 trVLP cell culture system use in BSL-2 if the Caco-2-Nint cells were used for infection by SARS-CoV-2 trVLP within 8 passages. All other experiments in this study involving authentic virus or SARS-CoV-2 trVLP infections were performed in the biosafety level 3 facility of Fudan University following all regulations.Statistical analysisStudent’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used to test for statistical significance of the differences between the different group parameters. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."}, "stats": {"Results": {"chars": 20404, "tokens": 3097, "source": "regular"}, "Materials and methods": {"chars": 11429, "tokens": 1652, "source": "regular"}}, "meta": {"journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1009439", "publisher_blocked": false, "no_body": false}}
