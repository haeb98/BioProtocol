Current findings support the idea that for EsxA to\ninteract with host membranes, EsxA must dissociate from EsxB\nat low pH. However, the molecular mechanism by which the\nEsxA:B heterodimer separates is not clear. In the present study,\nusing liposome-leakage and cytotoxicity assays, LC-MS/MS–\nbased proteomics, and CCF-4 FRET analysis, we obtained evi-\ndence that the N\u0002-acetylation of the Thr-2 residue on EsxA, a\npost-translational modification that is present in mycobacteria\nbut absent in Escherichia coli, is required for the EsxA:B separa-\ntion. Substitutions at Thr-2 that precluded N\u0002-acetylation\ninhibited the heterodimer separation and hence prevented EsxA\nfrom interacting with the host membrane, resulting in attenu-\nated mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence.\nMolecular dynamics simulations revealed that at low pH, the\nN\u0002-acetylated Thr-2 makes direct and frequent “bind-and-re-\nlease” contacts with EsxB, which generates a force that pulls\nEsxB away from EsxA. In summary, our findings provide evi-\ndence that the N\u0002-acetylation at Thr-2 of EsxA facilitates disso-\nciation of the EsxA:B heterodimer required for EsxA membrane\npermeabilization and mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and\nvirulence.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)3 is the causative agent for\ntuberculosis, one of the leading infectious diseases in the world\nwith 10 million people falling ill in 2017, and \u00021.6 million\ndeaths (1, 2). It is believed that after the Mtb-containing aero-\nsolized droplets are inhaled into the lung, Mtb is encountered\nby alveolar macrophages and internalized into the phagosome,\nwhere Mtb manages to survive through arresting phagosome\nmaturation, including inhibition of vATPase-mediated acidifi-\ncation (3–6). Recent compelling evidence supports that Mtb\npenetrates the phagosome and translocates into the cytosol\n(termed cytosolic translocation), where Mtb replicates and\nundergoes cell-to-cell spreading (7). The ability of Mtb to arrest\nphagosome maturation and to translocate from the phagosome\nto the cytosol has been attributed, at least in part, to the type VII\nsecretion system, named ESX-1 and the secreted virulence fac-\ntors EsxA (ESAT-6) and EsxB (CFP-10). The Mtb mutants with\neither gene deletions or defects in secretion of EsxA and/or\nEsxB were not able to translocate into the cytosol and showed\nsignificant reduction in host-cell lysis and cell-to-cell spreading\n(7–19).\nIn our previous studies, we have found that Mtb EsxA exhib-\nits a unique membrane-permeabilizing activity that is not pres-\nent in the homologous EsxA ortholog from nonpathogenic\nMycobacterium smegmatis (Ms) (20). EsxA undergoes pH-de-\npendent conformational changes, inserts into the membrane,\nand forms a membrane-spanning complex (21). The essential\nrole of EsxA membrane-permeabilizing activity in phagosome\nrupture and cytosolic translocation is further confirmed by a\nrecent study in which single-residue mutations at Gln-5 of\nEsxA up- or down-regulated the membrane-permeabilizing\nactivity and consequently up- or down-regulated mycobacterial\ncytosolic translocation and virulence in cultured cells and in\nzebra fish (22).\nThe genes encoding EsxA and EsxB are located in the same\noperon within the ESX-1 locus. EsxA and EsxB are co-ex-\npressed and co-secreted as a heterodimer (23). Our earlier\nstudy has demonstrated that EsxA, but not EsxB, has the mem-\nbrane-permeabilizing activity, and EsxB is believed to function\nas a chaperone (20). Current studies support a model that the\nheterodimer is dissociated at low pH to allow EsxA to penetrate\nthe membranes (24). However, the data regarding to the het-\nerodimer dissociation are conflicting. The native heterodimer\nextracted from Mtb culture filtrate was found to be dissociated\nat low pH (24). Surprisingly, however, the studies using the\nrecombinant proteins prepared from Escherichia coli suggest\nthat the heterodimer was not dissociated by acidification. This\nis evidenced by one of our earlier studies that the heterodimer\nThis work was supported by NIGMS, National Institutes of Health Grant\nSC1GM095475\n(to\nJ.

In the absence of lipid mem-\nbranes, EsxA formed aggregates in the acidic solution because\nof increased solvent-exposed hydrophobicity. In contrast, the\nheterodimer showed little aggregation at pH 4.0, suggesting\nthat EsxB remains bound to EsxA at low pH and prevents EsxA\nfrom forming aggregates, which otherwise would be observed if\nEsxA was released from EsxB (20). Our data are consistent with\nan earlier CD analysis showing that the Ec-heterodimer is not\ndissociated at low pH (25).\nWe hypothesized that the mycobacteria-produced proteins\ncontain unique features (e.g. post-translational modifications)\nthat are required for heterodimer dissociation at low pH. In line\nwith this hypothesis, the native EsxA protein isolated from the\nculture filtrate of Mtb was displayed as multiple spots in 2-D\nSDS-PAGE, and some of the spots contained a N\u0002-acetylation\nat residue Thr-2 (26). Moreover, the heterodimer produced\nfrom a Ms strain was found to have a N\u0002-acetylation on the\nThr-2 residue of EsxA (27). Interestingly, EsxB preferred to\nbind the nonacetylated EsxA, but not the acetylated form in a\n2-D overlay assay (26). Deletion of the N\u0002-acetyltransferase in\nMycobacterium marinum (Mm) disrupted the homeostasis\nof EsxA N\u0002-acetylation and attenuated the virulence (28).\nTogether, these studies suggest that the N\u0002-acetylation of EsxA\nplays an important role in mycobacterial virulence through\nfacilitating heterodimer dissociation at low pH. In the present\nstudy, we have obtained the evidence showing that the\nN\u0002-acetylation at Thr-2 of EsxA is required for EsxA membrane\npermeabilization, mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and\nvirulence through facilitating heterodimer dissociation.\nResults\nThe Ms-produced Mtb heterodimer, but not Ec-produced\nheterodimer, disrupted liposomal membrane at low pH\nWe hypothesized that Ms-heterodimer, but not Ec-het-\nerodimer, dissociates at low pH and permeabilizes the lipo-\nsomal membrane. The membrane-permeabilizing activity\nof Ms-heterodimer and Ec-heterodimer was tested with the\nANTS/DPX fluorescence dequenching assay. As expected, Ms-\nheterodimer permeabilized the membrane at low pH, whereas\nEc-heterodimer was not active (Fig. 1A). 4-Chloro-7-nitroben-\nzofurazan (NBD-Cl) only reacts with free N-terminal \u0002-amino\ngroup in nonacetylated proteins and emits fluorescence, but it\ndoes not react with N\u0002-acetylated proteins because of a lack of\nfree N-terminal amino group. Thus, we used NBD-Cl to test\nthe states of N\u0002-acetylation for Ms-heterodimer and Ec-het-\nerodimer. As expected, the Ms-heterodimer exhibited a sig-\nnificantly lower NBD-Cl fluorescence, compared with Ec-\nheterodimer, indicating that Ms-heterodimer, but not\nEc-heterodimer, is N\u0002-acetylated (Fig. 1B).\nThe mutations at Thr-2 abolished the membrane-\npermeabilizing activity of the Ms heterodimers through\nblocking separation of EsxA and EsxB\nThe Gln and Ala residues have been used to functionally\nmimic acetylation of amino group of an internal Lys residue,\nwhereas an Arg serves as a nonacetylated control (29). Thus,\nwe generated T2A, T2Q, and T2R mutations and tested the\neffects of these mutations on the heterodimer membrane–\npermeabilizing activity.\nUnexpectedly, all of the mutations abolished the Ms-het-\nerodimer’s membrane-permeabilizing activity (Fig. 2, A and B).\nThe result suggests that either the mutations blocked the het-\nerodimer separation or abolished the EsxA membrane-per-\nmeabilizing activity. To test whether the mutations abolished\nthe membrane-permeabilizing activity, we purified the EsxA\nproteins containing the same mutations from E. coli and\napplied them to ANTS/DPX dequenching assay. The result\nshowed that the mutations did not affect EsxA membrane-per-\nmeabilizing activity (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that the muta-\ntions at Thr-2 blocked the heterodimer separation at low pH.\nThe mutations that block EsxA and EsxB separation do not\nhave N\u0002-acetylation\nTo validate the acetylation state of EsxA WT and the\nmutants, we developed a protocol to isolate EsxA and EsxB\nfrom the Ms-heterodimer proteins (Fig. 3A). Then the presence\nof N\u0002-acetylation on the EsxA proteins was measured by\nNBD-Cl (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results in Fig. 1B, Ec-\nEsxA(WT) had a significantly higher fluorescence signal than\nMs-EsxA(WT). Similar to Ec-EsxA(WT), the Ms-EsxA mutants\n(T2A, T2Q, and T2R) emitted significantly higher fluorescence\nFigure 1. The EsxA:B heterodimer produced in Ms, but not in E. coli, permeabilized the liposomes at low pH, implicating the role of N\u0002-acetylation in\nheterodimer dissociation. A, the heterodimers EsxA:B purified from M. smegmatis (Ms) or E. coli (Ec) were tested in three independent experiments with\nANTS/DPX dequenching assay at pH 4.0. B, equal amounts of the heterodimer EsxA:B(Ms) or EsxA:B(Ec) were incubated with NBD-Cl at room temperature.\nNBD-Cl is a fluorescent dye that only reacts with a free N-terminal site without N\u0002-acetylation was recorded at 535 nm (excitation at 480 nm) and plotted as a\nfunction of time.\nN\u0002-Acetylation of EsxA facilitates heterodimer separation\n5786\nJ.

At the indicated times, the fluorescence intensity of NBD-Cl was measured. C, the indicated EsxA proteins, purified from Ms or Ec as\nindicated, were analyzed via LC-MS/MS to identify the post-translational modifications. The residues with acetylation are labeled as A, and the residues with\noxidation are labeled as O.\nN\u0002-Acetylation of EsxA facilitates heterodimer separation\nJ. Biol. Chem.

Next, we applied Ms-Esx-\nA(WT), Ms-EsxA(T2A), and Ec-EsxA(WT) to LC-MS/MS\nto further confirm the N\u0002-acetylation states. In addition,\nMs-EsxA(T2S), a mutant equivalent to WT, was included in the\nLC-MS/MS analysis. The results showed that both Ms-Esx-\nA(WT) and Ms-EsxA(T2S) had the first Met residue removed\nand the second residue (either Thr-2 or Ser2) acetylated (Fig.\n3C). Although Ms-EsxA(T2A) had the first Met residue\nremoved, the second Ala residue was not acetylated. The Ec-\nEsxA(WT) still has the first Met residue. Interestingly, the LC-\nMS/MS detected multiple acetylation and oxygenation modifi-\ncations in the internal sequences of both Ms-EsxA and\nEc-EsxA, and the roles of these modifications are currently\nunknown.\nEsxB preferred to bind nonacetylated EsxA to inhibit the\nmembrane-permeabilizing activity\nAn earlier study has shown that EsxB preferred to bind non-\nacetylated EsxA rather than acetylated EsxA in a 2-D overlay\nassay (26). Thus, we hypothesize that EsxB will prefer to inhibit\nthe membrane-permeabilizing activity of the nonacetylated\nMs-EsxA(T2A) than that of the acetylated Ms-EsxA(WT). First,\nwe tested and confirmed that the proteins Ms-EsxA(WT) and\nMs-EsxA(T2A) that were isolated from the heterodimers had\nsimilar membrane-permeabilizing activity to Ec-EsxA(WT),\nwhich once again confirms that the states of N\u0002-acetylation do\nnot affect membrane-permeabilizing activity (Fig. 4, A and B).\nThen Ms-EsxA(WT) and Ms-EsxA(T2B) were incubated with\nEsxB at a series of EsxB/EsxA molar ratios. As expected, EsxB\npreferred to inhibit Ms-EsxA(T2A) rather than Ms-EsxA(WT)\nin membrane permeabilization, especially at the lower EsxB/\nEsxA ratios (Fig. 5, A–C).\nThe mutations without N\u0002-acetylation attenuated\nmycobacterial virulence and inhibited cytosolic translocation\nHere, we investigated the effects of the T2X mutations in\nmycobacterial pathogenesis. The genes carrying T2X muta-\ntions were expressed in the Mm\u0003EsxA:B strain, in which the\nendogenous esxB-esxA operon was deleted. We found that the\nT2X mutations did not affect the expression and secretion of\nEsxA and EsxB in the Mm strains (Fig. S1). As expected, the Mm\nstrains carrying the nonacetylated mutations T2A, T2Q, and\nT2R had a significantly lower cytotoxicity than the strain car-\nrying the acetylated mutation T2S (Fig. 6A). Mm WT and\nMm\u0003EsxA:B were used as the positive control and negative\ncontrol, respectively. Furthermore, using the previously estab-\nlished CCF4-FRET assay, we found that the nonacetylated\nmutations T2A, T2Q, and T2R abolished mycobacterial cyto-\nsolic translocation, whereas T2S maintained a similar activity as\nthe WT (Fig. 6B). The data are consistent to a previous report\nindicating that deletion of a N\u0002-acetyltransferase in Mm dis-\nrupted the homeostasis of EsxA acetylation and attenuated the\nvirulence (28).\nMolecular dynamic simulation detects frequent “bind-and-\nrelease” contacts between the acetylated Thr-2(Ac) and EsxB\nThe reported solution structure of EsxA:B heterodimer does\nnot have the N\u0002-acetylation on Thr-2, and the Thr-2 residue is\ndistal from the contact interface between EsxA and EsxB. It is\nnot clear how the acetylation at Thr-2 affects the heterodimer\nseparation at low pH. Thus, we performed (MD) simulation on\nthe heterodimers with and without N\u0002-acetylation of Thr-2 at\npH 7 and 4, respectively (Movie S1 and Fig. 7). At pH 7 the\nnonacetylated Thr-2 comes in a close vicinity of EsxB but is\nunable to make a direct contact to EsxB (Fig. 7, A and C). Com-\npared with nonacetylated Thr-2, the acetylated Thr-2(Ac)\nmoves further away from EsxB at pH 7 (Fig. 7, B and D). Inter-\nestingly, at pH 4 the nonacetylated N-terminal loop of EsxA has\nno direct contact with EsxB (Fig. 7, E and G), but the acetylated\nN-terminal loop is able to make direct contacts with EsxB in a\nfrequent bind-and-release mode (Movie S1 and Fig. 7, F and H).\nThe electrostatic force was calculated between two sets of res-\nidues as demonstrated in Fig. S2 using DelPhiForce program. A\ncontact is defined as two residues that contain at least a pair of\natoms within 4 Å distance. The magnitude of the force is 43.959\npN, and its direction is shown by the orange arrow (Fig. S2).\nTherefore, when the N terminus of EsxA is moving away from\nEsxB, it pulls EsxB away in the direction of the arrow. Hence,\nthe MD simulation data support that the acetylated Thr-2 res-\nidue plays a significant role in the dissociation process of the\ncomplex.\nFigure 4. The N\u0002-acetylation of EsxA did not affect the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA. A, the indicated Ms-EsxA proteins isolated from the\nMs-heterodimer were tested for membrane-permeabilizing activity using ANTS/DPX assay. The Ec-EsxA (WT) protein, purified from Ec, was used as a control.\nThe representative curves from at least three independent experiments are shown. B, the average end-point fluorescence intensity from at least three\nindependent experiments was calculated and is shown (p \u0004 0.05).\nN\u0002-Acetylation of EsxA facilitates heterodimer separation\n5788\nJ. Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(17) 5785–5794\n\nDiscussion\nEsxA and EsxB are co-expressed and co-secreted as a het-\nerodimer in mycobacteria. The roles of ESX-1, EsxA, and EsxB\nin mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence have\nbeen confirmed in a series of studies (7, 17–19). Earlier bio-\nchemical studies have demonstrated that EsxA has a pH-de-\npendent membrane-permeabilizing activity, whereas EsxB\nappears to function as a chaperone for EsxA (20). Current stud-\nies support a model that the EsxA:B heterodimer is dissociated\nat low pH, which allows EsxA to permeabilize the membranes\n(24). However, the mechanism of the heterodimer separation is\nnot known. For the first time, the present study tested the het-\nerodimers containing EsxA with or without N\u0002-acetylation and\nobtained the evidence that the N\u0002-acetylation at Thr-2 of EsxA\nfacilitates the heterodimer separation at low pH, which allows\nEsxA to permeabilize liposomal membrane in vitro, as well as\nmediate mycobacterial phagosome escape and cytosolic trans-\nlocation in mycobacteria-infected macrophages.\nAs discussed above, the essentiality of EsxA and EsxB in\nmycobacterial pathogenesis has been well-documented in a\nseries of reports. Genetic manipulations that either deleted the\ngene of esxA or esxB or abolished the secretion of EsxA and\nEsxB have attenuated mycobacterial virulence and inhibited\nthe phagosome rupture, cytosolic translocation, and cell-to-cell\nspreading (7, 10, 17–19). Moreover, the biochemical character-\nizations have demonstrated that EsxA possesses a unique mem-\nbrane-permeabilizing activity that is not present in its ortholog\nin nonpathogenic M. smegmatis (20). Thus, it is reasonable to\nbelieve that during infection, the secreted EsxA exerts its mem-\nbrane-permeabilizing activity to penetrate the phagosome\nmembranes and facilitate mycobacterial cytosolic transloca-\ntion. We have reported that the mutations at the Gln-5 residue\nof EsxA (e.g. Q5V and Q5K) have resulted in up- or down-\nregulation of EsxA membrane-permeabilizing activity in vitro.\nMoreover, these mutations up- or down-regulated the myco-\nbacterial virulence and cytosolic translocation accordingly,\ndemonstrating the specific and accurate correlation between\nEsxA membrane-permeabilizing activity and mycobacterial\nvirulence, as well as the ability to penetrate phagosome mem-\nbrane (22). Once again, the present study provides new evi-\ndence that the N\u0002-acetylation at Thr-2 of EsxA is required for\nmycobacterial virulence and cytosolic translocation through\nfacilitating the heterodimer separation.\nBecause Thr-2 has no any contact with EsxB as shown in the\nreported solution structure of EsxA:B heterodimer, how\nN\u0002-acetylation on Thr-2 affects heterodimer separation had\nFigure 5. EsxB preferentially inhibited nonacetylated EsxA(T2A) over its N\u0002-acetylated counterpart. The Ms-produced EsxA(WT) and EsxA(T2A) proteins\nwere incubated with various concentrations of EsxB as the indicated molar ratios. The mixtures were tested in triplicate by ANTS/DPX assay for membrane-\npermeabilizing activity. The representative curves are shown in A and B, respectively. The relative inhibition from at least three independent experiments for\na total n \u0005 9 was summarized in C. For EsxA:B 0.5:1.0 ratio, p \u0005 0.0015 and for EsxA:B 1:1 ratio p \u0005 0.0012. Error bars represent S.D.\nFigure 6. The non-N\u0002-acetylate EsxA diminished mycobacterial virulence and cytosolic translocation in macrophages.

Dead cells were counted in random fields (***, n \u0005 22,\np \u0004 0.0001). B, mycobacterial cytosolic translocation was monitored by using CCF4-AM as a FRET reporter. The blue/green ratio was measured by comparing\nemissions at 450 and 530 nm with excitation at 409 nm.

Here, the MD simulation result provides an\ninteresting model, in which the acetylated Thr-2(Ac) has fre-\nquent bind-and-release contacts with EsxB at low pH, generat-\ning a dragging force to pull EsxB away from EsxA.\nN\u0002-Acetylation is a common modification in eukaryotes and\nplays important roles in protein–protein interaction, protein\nactivity and stability, and cell growth and cell cycle, etc. (30, 31).\nAlthough N\u0002-acetylation in eukaryotes has been well-studied,\nlittle is known about it in bacteria, including mycobacteria.\nOver 100 proteins in Mtb have been found to be N\u0002-acetylated,\nincluding EsxA (32), and protein acetylation has been corre-\nlated to pathogenesis (33, 34). Currently, three N\u0002-acetyltrans-\nferases in E. coli, RimI, RimL, and RimJ, have been identified to\nacetylate ribosomal proteins at Ser-18, Leu-12, and Ser-5,\nrespectively (34–36). A biochemical study has found that RimI\nin Mtb has a relaxed substrate specificity, but little is known\nabout the physiological substrates of the enzyme (37), which\nwarrants further investigation.\nA recent study has shown that the recombinant EsxA does\nnot lyse cell membranes, and the lytic activity previously attrib-\nuted to EsxA is due to residual ASB-14 detergent in the prepa-\nration (38). In fact, we had the similar observations that addi-\ntion of the recombinant EsxA protein to the surface of lung\nepithelial cell lines WI-26 and A549 did not lyse the cells. More-\nover, Conrad et al. (40) showed that blocking phagosomal acid-\nification by bafilomycin did not decrease the ESX-1–mediated\nphagosomal permeabilization, suggesting that acidification is\nnot required for membrane permeabilization. Recently, Lien-\nard et al. (39) employed a collection of Mm ESX-1 transposon\nmutants, including the mutants that disrupt EsxA secretion, to\ninfect macrophages and showed that the factors independent of\nEsxAB play a role in cytosolic translocation. It is not clear how\nthe discrepancy arises and what is the broken link between the\nEsxA pH-dependent membrane-permeabilizing activity in\nliposomal membrane and the ability of mycobacteria to rupture\nphagosome membrane during infection. Other factors from\nmycobacteria and host cells, even including properties of target\nmembranes, may be involved in this process, which warrants\nfurther investigation.\nMaterials and methods\nGeneration of T2X mutations on the Mtb esxA gene for\nexpression in E. coli, Ms, and Mm\nFor expression in E. coli—Using the previously reported plas-\nmid pET22b–esxA–His6 as the template (20–22, 41), the\nmutations T2A, T2Q, T2R, and T2S were introduced into\nthe esxA gene by PCR using the primers listed in Table S1.\nAll of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\nThe resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3)\ncells for expression. The cells were grown at 37 °C while\nshaking at 250 rpm until A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Protein\nexpression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-\u0003-D-1-\nthiogalactopyranoside for 3–8 h at 37 °C. The cells were\nharvested, and the proteins were purified as previously\ndescribed (20–22, 41). Typical yield averaged between 30\nand 60 mg/liter of culture.\nFor expression in Ms—The pMyNT plasmid containing the\nMtb esxB-esxA operon (27) was used as the template. The\nmutations T2A, T2Q, T2R, and T2S were introduced by over-\nlapping PCR using the primers listed in Table S1. All of the\nmutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pMyNT\nplasmids carrying various T2X mutations were electroporated\ninto Ms mc2155 strain (voltage, 2,500 V; capacitance, 25 micro-\nfarads; resistance, 1,000 \u0006). The Ms cultures were grown at\n37 °C overnight or until A600 reached 2.0. Protein expression\nwas induced by adding 0.2% (w/v) acetamide for 12–16 h. The\ncells were harvested. The soluble heterodimer proteins were\npurified with immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography\nby passing through a Ni2\u0007 column, followed by a size-exclusion\nFigure 7.

Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(17) 5785–5794\n\nchromatography as previously described (27, 42–45). Typical\nyield averaged between 20 and 40 mg/liter of culture.\nFor expression in Mm—The T2X mutations (T2A, T2R, T2Q,\nand T2S) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent\nQuikChange kit) using the pMH406 plasmid containing esxB-\nesxA operon as a template. The mutations were confirmed by\nDNA sequencing. The mutated plasmids were electroporated\ninto Mm\u0003EsxA:B as previously described (44).\nLiposome leakage assay\nThe liposome leakage assay was performed as previously\ndescribed (20, 21, 41, 46, 47). Briefly, 20 mg of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-\nglycero-3-phosphocholine was dried with nitrogen air and left\nin a vacuum overnight. The samples were rehydrated with 1 ml\nof the buffer (5 mM HEPES, 50 mM 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6\ntrisulfonic acid (ANTS), and 50 mM p-xylene-bis-pyridinium\nbromide (DPX)). The suspension was subjected to six freeze-\nthaw cycles and extruded via a 0.2-\u0004m membrane filter 20\ntimes. The liposomes were then desalted to remove excess\nANTS and DPX using a HiTrap desalting column. The desalted\nliposomes were mixed with 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaAc at pH\n4.0. Three separate reaction mixtures were generated and indi-\nvidually excited at 350 nm, and emissions were recorded at 520\nnm in an ISS K2 phase modulation fluorometer. 100 \u0004g of the\ntested protein was injected into the solution after \u000230 s of the\nassay, and fluorescence was observed.\nIsolation of Mtb EsxA proteins from the Ms-produced Mtb\nEsxA:B heterodimer\nThe Mtb EsxA:B heterodimer purified from Ms was incu-\nbated in a solution containing 6 M guanidine at 4 °C overnight.\nThe proteins were then passed through a HisTrap column (GE\nHealthcare). The His-tagged EsxB protein was bound to the\ncolumn, and the untagged EsxA was collected in flow through.\nThe His-tagged EsxB protein was eluted by an imidazole gradi-\nent. Both EsxA and EsxB were subjected to an extensive dialysis\nusing a 3000 molecular weight cutoff membrane. The samples\nwere then concentrated and passed through gel filtration for a\ncomplete buffer exchange.\nDetection of N\u0002-acetylation by NBD-Cl\nNBD-Cl only reacts with free N-terminal \u0002-amino group in\nnonacetylated proteins and emits fluorescence, and it does not\nreact with N\u0002-acetylated proteins because of the lack of free\nN-terminal amino group (48). Proteins (6 \u0004M) were incubated\nwith 0.5 mM NBD-Cl at room temperature. At different hours\nof postincubation, the samples were subjected to fluorescence\nmeasurement with excitation at 460 nm and emission at 535\nnm.\nSample preparation for mass spectrometry\nThe concentration of four protein samples, EsxA protein\npurified from E. coli and the EsxA, EsxA(T2A), and EsxA pro-\nteins purified from Ms were determined via bicinchoninic acid\nassay (BCA) according to manufacturer instructions (Pierce\nBCA protein assay kit, catalog no. 23227). Then 100 \u0004g of each\nprotein sample was used for protein digestion via FASP protein\ndigestion (Expedeon, catalog no. 44250), using either trypsin\n(catalog no. Sigma, catalog no. T6567) or pepsin (Sigma, catalog\nno. P7012). In summary, 100 \u0004g of each sample was resus-\npended in 200 \u0004l of 12.48 M urea Tris-HCl solution (urea solu-\ntion). Then 10 mg of DL-DTT (Sigma, catalog no. D0632-5G)\nwas added to each sample and placed in a nutating mixer for 45\nmin. The samples were then transferred to a 30-kDa filter and\ncentrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. 200 \u0004l of urea solution\nwas added to each spin filter and centrifuged at 14,000 \b g for\n15 min and repeated once more. Then 100 \u0004l of iodoacetamide\n1\b solution (iodoacetamide prepared at a 1:10 ratio in urea\nsolution) was added to each spin filter and incubated without\nmixing for 20 min in the dark. Afterward, spin filters were cen-\ntrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The spin filters were washed\ntwice by adding 100 \u0004l of urea solution and centrifuging at\n14,000 rpm for 15 min. Urea was removed from the samples by\nadding 100 \u0004l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to\nspin filters and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. This step\nwas repeated twice for a total of three times. Spin filters were\ntransferred to new spin filter tubes, and 100 \u0004l of digestion\nsolution at 0.02 \u0004g/\u0004l (either with trypsin or pepsin) was added\nto each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. 200 \u0004l of 0.1%\nformic acid water solution was added to each sample and\nspin filters containing resultant peptides and centrifuged at\n14,000 \b g for 10 min. Filtrate containing digested proteins\nwere frozen at \t80 °C for 2 h and lyophilized for 12 h. The\nsamples were resuspended with 100 \u0004l of 0.1% formic acid\nwater solution at a final concentration of 1 \u0004g/\u0004l.\nLC-MS/MS and bioinformatic method\nResultant complex peptide mixtures were analyzed via tech-\nnical duplicates by LC-MS/MS for 2 h to 1 day with the QE\nOrbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) along with the Dionex\nUltiMate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Sci-\nentific) using the two digestive protocols (trypsin or pepsin).\nThe samples were loaded in line onto a C18 PicoChip column\n(75-\u0004m inner diameter \b 15-\u0004m tip packed with 10.5 cm of\nReprosil PUR C18 3 \u0004m 120 Å; 25 \u0004m \b 50 cm fused-silica tail,\nNew Objective) that was previously equilibrated with solvent A\n(95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (5%\nwater, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The column was\nconditioned for 10 min with a flowrate of 0.5 \u0004l/min with 95%\nsolvent A, 5% solvent B. The sample was injected and loaded\nonto column and conditioned for 10 min with solvent A. Elu-\ntion of peptides was completed by running a linear gradient to\n40% solvent B for 95 min, followed by 10 min of 95% solvent B.\nThe sample was re-equilibrated for 10 min with 5% solvent B.\nFull-scan spectra were collected via Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher\nScientific). Two blank injections were run in between samples\nusing a 30-min interval with seesaw washes using 5–80% ACN\ngradients. QE Orbitrap settings are as follows: full MS resolu-\ntion of 70,000, AGC target of 1e6, scan range from 400 to 1600\nm/z; MS/MS were run with a resolution of 17,500, AGC target\nof 2e6, scan range from 200 to 2000, and 3 m/z isolation win-\ndow. The spectra were searched using Proteome Discoverer\n2.1.1.21 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and filtered via Sequest HT\nwith an estimated false-discovery rate of 0.01 against sequences\nfrom Ms M1552, E. coli BL21, human, bovine, human keratin,\nand porcine trypsin. A 20-ppm precursor and a 0.02 fragment\nN\u0002-Acetylation of EsxA facilitates heterodimer separation\nJ. Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(17) 5785–5794 5791\n\nmass tolerance were used. Cysteine carbamidomethylation,\nmethionine, oxidation, and acetylation were set fixed and vari-\nable modifications, respectively. The output files were then\nmanually analyzed and collectively used to generate represen-\ntative data.\nWestern blotting\nMm recombinant strains with respective EsxA insertions\nwere cultured in 7H9 medium and grown to mid-log phase.\nThey were washed with PBS and transferred to Sauton’s\nmedium while normalizing all cultures to A600 \u0005 0.8. The bac-\nteria were cultured for 2 days until harvest. The bacterial cells\nwere collected by centrifugation. The proteins in the culture\nsupernatant were precipitated by TCA. The bacterial cells were\nresuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing a mixture of protease\ninhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sonicated at 30%\namplitude for five cycles of 30-s pulse and 60-s rest. The culture\nfiltrates and total bacterial lysates were applied to SDS-PAGE\nand transferred transferring onto polyvinylidene difluoride\nmembrane. Western blots were performed to detect EsxA using\nanti-EsxA antibody (sc-57730, Santa Cruz). As controls, Ag85\n(secreted in culture filtrate) and GroEL (only in cell lysate) were\nalso detected by anti-Ag85 (NR-13800, BEI) and anti-GroEl\nantibodies (NR-13813, BEI), respectively.\nLive/dead cytotoxicity assay\nRAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified\nEagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with peni-\ncillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRaw 264.7 macrophages were plated in a 24-well plate with a\ndensity of 5 \b 105/well for infection on the following day. The\nMm strains were prepared with a single cell preparation proto-\ncol as previously described (22, 49). RAW264.7 cells were\ninfected with various Mm strains at a multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) of 10 for 1 h. The macrophages were washed three times\nwith PBS to remove free mycobacteria and incubated for\nanother 3 h. The macrophages were stained using calcein-AM\nand ethidium homodimer (Life Sciences) for 30 min, enabling\nvisualization under a fluorescence microscope for green cells\n(live) and red cells (dead). The numbers of dead cells were\nquantified from dozens of random fields from each sample.\nCCF-4 FRET assay\nMycobacterial cytosolic translocation was measured by\nCCF-4 FRET assay as previously described (17, 22, 50). Briefly,\nRAW264.7 cells were plated in triplicate in a 6-well plate at a\ndensity of 2.5 \b 106 cells/well. The macrophages were then\nincubated with CCF4-AM according to the manufacturer’s\nprotocol (Liveblazer B/G loading kit, Life Sciences). The cells\nwere infected with recombinant Mm strains at a MOI of 10 for\n2 h. Following infection, the macrophages were washed three\ntimes using PBS. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10%\nfetal bovine serum was added to the cells and incubated for \u00022\ndays. The samples were then excited at 409 nm, and the emis-\nsions were measured at 450 and 535 nm. The blue/green ratio\nwas calculated as I450/I535.\nMolecular dynamic simulation\nThe structure of EsxA:B heterodimer was downloaded from\nProtein Data Bank with Protein Data Bank code 1WA8 (51).\nDelPhiPka web server (52) was used to obtain the protonation\nstates of ionizable residues at pH 4 and pH 7 and assign the\nrespective states with visual molecular dynamics (VMD) (53).\nN\u0002-Acetylation of Thr-2 was performed on VMD after removal\nof Met-1. The four structures, i.e. nonacetylated and acetylated\nat pH 4 and pH 7 of EsxA:B heterodimer, were then solvated in\nwater box with TIP3 (54) water model and ionized with 150 mM\nNaCl in VMD. The final systems were then simulated with the\nMD simulation program NAMD (55). Each simulation was per-\nformed for 20 ns employing force field CHARMM27 (56). The\ntemperature was set as 300 K, and the pressure was 1 atm. The\nsnapshots from the simulations were taken to study the behav-\niors of the N-terminal loop of EsxA with and without N\u0002-acety-\nlation of Thr-2 at pH 4 and pH 7.\nData availability statement\nAll data are contained within the manuscript.\nAuthor contributions—J.

S-palmitoylation refers to\nreversible covalent modiﬁcation of cysteine residues of proteins\nby saturated fatty acids. In vivo, palmitoylation is regulated by\nconcerted activities of DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases (DHHC\nPATs) and acyl protein thioesterases (APTs), which are enzymes\nresponsible for protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation,\nrespectively. Here, we investigate the role of protein palmitoylation\nin red blood cell (RBC) invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. We\ndemonstrate for the ﬁrst time that free merozoites require PAT\nactivity for microneme secretion in response to exposure to the\nphysiologically relevant low [K+] environment, characteristic of\nblood plasma. We have adapted copper catalyzed alkyne azide\nchemistry (CuAAC) to image palmitoylation in merozoites and found that exposure to low [K+] activates PAT activity in\nmerozoites. Moreover, using acyl biotin exchange chemistry (ABE) and confocal imaging, we demonstrate that a calcium dependent\nprotein kinase, PfCDPK1, an essential regulator of key invasion processes such as motility and microneme secretion, undergoes\ndynamic palmitoylation and localizes to the merozoite membrane. Treatment of merozoites with the PAT inhibitor, 2-\nbromopalmitate (2-BP), eﬀectively inhibits microneme secretion and RBC invasion by the parasite, thus opening the possibility of\ntargeting P. falciparum PATs for antimalarial drug discovery to inhibit blood stage growth of malaria parasites.\nKEYWORDS: malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, S-palmitoylation, CuAAC “click” chemistry, merozoites, microneme secretion,\nacyl biotin exchange\nM\nalaria continues to be a global public health problem\ndespite intense eﬀorts for its control and elimination.\nThere were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria worldwide\nthat resulted in more than 435 000 deaths in 2017.1 Plasmodium\nfalciparum accounts for 99.7% of total malaria cases in Africa,\nwhich is where most of the malaria related deaths occur.1 The\nemergence of drug resistance against artemisinin in P. falciparum\nstrains from Southeast Asia has highlighted the need for\ndiscovery and development of novel drugs to block malaria\nparasite growth.2 A better understanding of parasite biology is\ncrucial to identify new drug targets and develop novel inhibitors\nto block parasite multiplication.\nP. falciparum, an obligate intracellular parasite, has a complex\nlife cycle that involves two diﬀerent hosts; an invertebrate host,\nthe Anopheles mosquito, and the vertebrate human host. It\nundergoes a tightly regulated developmental program in both\nhosts. Post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) are known to\nregulate critical events in developmental processes that enable\nprogression of malaria parasites from one stage to the next.3 In\nrecent years, development of highly sensitive chemical biology\nmethods and mass spectroscopy approaches have contributed\nsigniﬁcantly to analysis of PTMs such as protein phosphor-\nylation, methylation, ubiquitination, prenylation and acylation\nin P. falciparum.3−5,7 Protein phosphorylation is known to play\nessential roles in parasite growth, adaptation, and develop-\nment.3−6 PTMs that mediate lipid modiﬁcation of proteins such\nas myristoylation, prenylation and palmitoylation are now being\nexamined for their role in the biology of Plasmodium and other\nparasites.8−14 Among these, protein palmitoylation is the most\nabundant lipid PTM and is reversible in nature. Palmitoylation is\ncatalyzed by DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases (DHHC PATs),\nwhich add 16-carbon saturated fatty acids to cysteine residues of\nproteins via a thioester bond. More than 400 proteins undergo\npalmitoylation in blood stages of P. falciparum.

In particular, the role of palmitoylation in invasion of\nred blood cells (RBCs) remains poorly understood.\nThe invasion of RBCs by merozoites is central to parasite\nmultiplication in the blood stage of the life cycle of malaria\nparasites. RBC invasion is a complex process that is mediated by\nspeciﬁc molecular interactions between host receptors and\nparasite ligands.15 A number of key merozoite ligands that\nmediate these interactions are stored in apical organelles that are\nreferred to as micronemes and rhoptries. Timely release of\nparasite invasion ligands from micronemes and rhoptries to the\nmerozoite surface is critical for RBC invasion.15,16 Microneme\nrelease is triggered in response to external signals such as\nexposure of merozoites to a low [K+] environment as found in\nblood plasma.15−17 Exposure of merozoites to low [K+] leads to\na surge in cytosolic cAMP and release of Ca2+ from intracellular\nstores via activation of the PLC pathway.16,17 Apart from free\nCa2+ and cAMP, cGMP is also known to play a role in regulation\nof signaling events leading to RBC invasion.6 Ca2+ and cyclic\nmononucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, activate downstream\neﬀectors such as calcium dependent protein kinases\n(PfCDPKs), the cAMP responsive protein kinase, PfPKA, and\nthe cGMP responsive protein kinase, PfPKG.4,6 Activation of\nthese kinases leads to phosphorylation of substrate proteins that\nregulate motility, microneme secretion, and invasion.4−6,18\nProtein palmitoylation is also required for invasion, but\nmechanistic details about the roles of palmitoylation in invasion\nare not understood.\nPalmitoylation is known to inﬂuence protein function in many\ncrucial ways. For example, palmitoylation imparts hydrophobic\ncharacter to a protein in a reversible manner and can be a key\ndeterminant of subcellular localization and traﬃcking of proteins\nas in the case of Ras-GTPases.19,20 Palmitoylation can inﬂuence\nprotein stability and prevent ubiquitin mediated degradation of\nproteins increasing the half-life of cellular proteins such as Tlg1\nand TEAD proteins.21−23 Palmitoylation can also inﬂuence the\nactivity of proteins, facilitate protein−protein interactions, and\nmediate signal transduction pathways by regulating “on” and\n“oﬀ” states of proteins.24−26 The half-life of palmitoylated state\nfor proteins can vary from seconds to hours and is highly variable\nfor diﬀerent proteins.19,20,25 Given the range of eﬀects that\npalmitoylation can have on proteins, the eﬀects of palmitoyla-\ntion on a given protein cannot be predicted and requires\nexperimental validation. The reversible and dynamic character\nof S-palmitoylation makes it distinct from other lipid\nmodiﬁcations like myristoylation and isoprenylation, which are\nirreversible. Here, we have applied biochemical and chemical\nbiology methods to investigate the role of protein palmitoylation\nin the invasive competence of P. falciparum merozoites. We have\nfound that expression of palmitoyl transferases varies across\nintraerythrocytic development stages reaching maximum\nexpression in schizonts.\nWe have adapted and used a click chemistry method that tags\npalmitoylated proteins in the parasite with a ﬂuorescent reporter\nto proﬁlePAT activity in intraerythrocyticstages of P. falciparum.\nClickable analogues of fatty acids have been used earlier to label\nproteins in parasites to study palmitoylated and myristoylated\nproteome by chemical proteomic approaches.8,10,12 Here, we\nhave used clickable alkyne analogue of palmitic acid and an azide\nderivative of a ﬂuorophore to quantify changes in PAT activity in\nP. falciparum merozoites by rendering palmitoylated proteins\nﬂuorescent. Furthermore, we have applied this click chemistry\nimaging method to demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that PAT\nactivity in free merozoites is responsive to physiologically\nrelevant external signals. We also demonstrate that PAT activity\nin merozoites is necessary for microneme secretion and invasion\nof RBCs. Inhibition of PAT activity by 2-bromopalmitate (2-\nBP) blocks microneme secretion and RBC invasion. Moreover,\nwe have investigated the functional signiﬁcance of palmitoyla-\ntion of PfCDPK1 (Pf3D7_0217500), a kinase that mediates\nRBC invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. Our results identify\nPATs as potential targets to block RBC invasion and inhibit\nblood stage growth of P. falciparum.\n■RESULTS\nProtein S-Palmitoylation Is Abundant in Schizont\nStage. To investigate PAT activity in P. falciparum blood\nstage parasites, we adapted a click chemistry methodology and\nmetabolically labeled intraerythrocytic stages, i.e., rings,\ntrophozoites, and schizonts, with a clickable analogue of\npalmitic acid, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODA). Clickable\nanalogues of fatty acids are mimics of endogenous fatty\nacids.8,10,12,28−32 DHHC PATs (referred to here as PATs)\ncatalyze transfer of palmitic acid to cysteine residues of\nendogenous proteins.23,24,26−28 PATs can acylate endogenous\nproteins with 17-ODA when cells are incubated in media\nsupplemented with 17-ODA.8,29−31,33 Figure 1A summarizes\nthe protocol used for labeling and subsequent click chemistry on\nparasite smears.

(A) Cellular imaging of PAT activity in merozoites in IC,\nEC, EC + 2-BP, and EC without 17-ODA by CuAAC click chemistry. Freshly egressed P. falciparum merozoites were initially incubated in IC buﬀer\nsupplemented with 100 μM of 17-ODA to allow incorporation of 17-ODA by in vivo PAT activity. Merozoites were then transferred to EC buﬀer,\nsupplemented with 100 μM of 17-ODA, with or without 2-BP and incubated for 15−30 min. Smears were prepared from treated merozoites, and\nCuAAC click reaction was performed to render palmitoylated proteins in merozoites ﬂuorescent. Control merozoites were incubated in EC buﬀer\nwithout addition of 17-ODA. Merozoites incubated in IC buﬀer have a weak ﬂuorescence intensity with very few cells being ﬂuorescent. Majority of\nmerozoites from EC buﬀer have a strong ﬂuorescence signal. Merozoites treated with 2-BP and merozoites incubated in EC buﬀer without 17-ODA do\nnot show any ﬂuorescence signal.

Role of palmitoylation in microneme secretion and RBC invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. (A) Role of palmitoylation in microneme\nsecretion by P. falciparum merozoites. Merozoites were initially incubated in IC buﬀer (IC buﬀer −140 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM\nglucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) with DMSO, 2-BP, or JCP-174 for 5 min and transferred to EC buﬀer (EC buﬀer −5 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM\nMgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 5.6 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) with DMSO, 2-BP, or JCP-174. Supernatants from each treatment condition were\nprobed by Western blotting with anti PfAMA-1 (microneme marker) and anti-PfNapL (cytoplasmic marker) rabbit sera to detect microneme\nsecretion and merozoite lysis, respectively. The merozoite cell pellet from each treatment condition was lysed and probed with anti-PfNapL sera as a\nloading control. The amount of secreted PfAMA-1 was quantiﬁed by densitometry scanning of three independent experiments. Analysis using one-way\nANOVA test conﬁrmed that diﬀerence in PfAMA-1 secretion in EC and EC + 2-BP conditions was statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.001 denoted by ***).\nACS Infectious Diseases\npubs.acs.org/journal/aidcbc\nArticle\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00321\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 379−392\n383\n\n12 DHHC-PATs.8,34 RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) data for the\nblood stages of P. falciparum suggests that the transcripts\ncorresponding to the PfDHHC PATs-1 (PF3D7_0303400), -2\n(PF3D7_0609800), -3 (PF3D7_1121000), and -7\n(PF3D7_0528400) are primarily expressed at the onset of\nschizogony.34 PfDHHC PAT-1 is homologous to TgDHHC\nPAT-14, which localizes to the inner membrane complex (IMC)\nin Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites.27 PfDHHC PAT-2 is\nhomologous to PbDHHC PAT-2, which is required for blood\nstage growth of P. berghei.35 Similarly, PfDHHC PAT-7 is\nhomologous to TgDHHC PAT-7, which is an essential enzyme,\nrequired for host cell invasion by T. gondii.27 PfDHHC PAT-7\nexpression has been reported to be strongly correlated with\nexpression of PfCDPK1 and genes required for motility in\nP. falciparum.18 The expression and subcellular localization of\nthese PATs was studied in asexual blood stages by\nimmunoﬂuorescence assays (IFAs) using antisera generated in\nmice against unique peptide regions from each of these PATs.\nIFA shows that PfDHHC PAT-1, -2, -3, and -7 (also referred to\nas PfPAT-1, -2, -3 and -7) are expressed in schizonts with\nminimal staining observed at ring and trophozoite stages (Figure\n1C, Supporting Information Figure S2). Apical staining was\nobserved for PfPAT-1, -2, -3, and -7 in daughter merozoites.\nColocalization studies with microneme protein PfAMA1\nindicates these PfPATs are localized at the apical end of the\nmerozoites (Supporting Information Figure S3). However,\nPfPATs do not overlap completely with PfAMA1 (Supporting\nInformation Figure S3). Western blot analysis of total schizont\nlysates and their membrane and cytoplasmic fractions revealed\nthat all four PfPATs-1, -2, -3, and -7 are detected in membrane\nfractions at approximately 74, 33, 38, and 48 kDa respectively,\nconsistent with their theoretical molecular mass (Figure 1D).\nThe membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were also probed with\nantisera raised against PfMSP119 (C-terminal 19kD region of\nmerozoite surface protein-1) and PfNapL (nucleosome\nassembly protein-large) as markers for membrane and\ncytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Rabbit anti-PfMSP119 sera\ndetected a band at ∼19 kDa and another at ∼42 kDa in the\nmembrane fraction (Figure 1D). Rabbit anti-PfNapL antisera\ndetects a band at ∼45 kDa, which is primarily present in the\ncytoplasmic fraction (Figure 1D).\nExposure of Merozoites to Low [K+] Activates Intra-\ncellular Palmitoyl Transferase Activity. Exposure of\nP. falciparum merozoites to a low [K+] buﬀer has been identiﬁed\nas a key external signal that activates signaling pathways that\nregulate microneme secretion.15−17 Here, we examined if\nexposure to low [K+] leads to changes in PAT activity in\nmerozoites. To investigate this, we adapted a click chemistry\nmethod28,29 to image dynamic palmitoylation in free merozoites.\nFreshly egressed merozoites were collected by centrifugation\nand incubated in intracellular-like (IC) buﬀer (high [K+]) or\nextracellular-like (EC) buﬀer (low [K+]) supplemented with 17-\nODA for 15 min. The merozoites were then smeared on glass\nslides and ﬁxed with methanol. Cells were then rendered\nﬂuorescent by adding Oregon Green 488 azide to 17-ODA\nlabeled parasites (Figure 2A,B). The merozoites that incorpo-\nrate 17-ODA in their proteins react with clickable ﬂuorophore,\nOregon Green 488 azide, and are rendered ﬂuorescent. Uptake\nand incorporation of 17-ODA signiﬁes PAT activity in\nmerozoites. Majority of merozoites in EC buﬀer were\nﬂuorescent but only few merozoites were ﬂuorescent in IC\ncondition (Figure 2A). Similarly, very limited number of\nmerozoites treated with 2-BP in EC buﬀer were ﬂuorescent\n(Figure 2B). Moreover, the ﬂuorescence signal in merozoites in\nEC buﬀer (low [K+]) was higher compared to merozoites in IC\nbuﬀer, indicating a distinct diﬀerence in PAT activity in IC and\nEC buﬀer conditions. The ﬂuorescence signal was however\nalmost completely abrogated in merozoites treated with 2-BP\nindicating that incorporation of 17-ODA by merozoite requires\nPAT activity (Figure 2A,B). Similarly, no ﬂuorescence was\ndetected in merozoites that were incubated in EC-like buﬀer\nwithout 17-ODA proving the speciﬁcity of click reaction and\nrequirement of 17-ODA labeling for ﬂuorescence signal (Figure\n2A). Together, these results demonstrate that exposure to an\nextracellular-like ionic environment (EC) with low [K+]\nactivates PAT activity in merozoites.\nProtein Palmitoylation in P. falciparum Merozoites Is\nRequired for Microneme Secretion and Erythrocyte\nInvasion. Inhibition of protein palmitoylation in P. falciparum\nschizonts with the PAT inhibitor, 2-BP, inhibits RBC invasion\nby the parasite, but the exact mechanisms for inhibition are not\nyet identiﬁed.8,9 Here, we examined the possible role of\npalmitoylation in microneme secretion by merozoites. Micro-\nneme secretion is a regulated process that is activated by\nexposure of merozoites to a low [K+] environment, which\ntriggers a surge in intracellular concentrations of second\nmessengers like Ca2+ and cAMP.15−17 Microneme secretion\nassays were performed with free merozoites in the presence of 2-\nBP or JCP-174.36 Treatment with 2-BP (50 μM) inhibited\nsecretion of PfAMA-1 from micronemes following exposure of\nmerozoites to EC buﬀer (Figure 3A). However, the treatment of\nmerozoites with JCP-174 did not block secretion of microneme\nproteins. To validate our ﬁndings further, we performed\nPfAMA-1 translocation assay (Figure 3B) with merozoites\nexposed to EC buﬀer or EC buﬀer containing 2-BP. Consistent\nwith the microneme secretion assay data, merozoites that were\nFigure 3. continued\nIn contrast, P value for diﬀerence between EC and EC + JCP-174 was not statistically signiﬁcant (ns).

Immunoﬂuorescence assay with anti-PfAMA1 mouse sera was used to detect PfAMA-1 on the surface\nof merozoites in EC buﬀer or EC buﬀer containing 2-BP. The treated merozoites were smeared on glass slides, ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde and stained\nwith anti-PfAMA1 rabbit sera, followed by goat antirabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 488. Fluorescence signal from surface of merozoites in EC\nand EC + 2-BP conditions were measured by ﬂuorescence microscopy. The bars represent average ﬂuorescent intensity (±SD) corresponding to\nPfAMA-1 on the merozoite surface from two independent experiments. More than 20 merozoites were scored for each condition in each experiment.\nDiﬀerence in ﬂuorescence signal between EC and EC + 2-BP conditions is statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05 indicated by * using unpaired t test).

Late stage P. falciparum schizonts were treated with either DMSO (Control) or 2-BP (at 20,\n50, and 100 μM) and mixed with uninfected RBCs to allow invasion in the presence of 2-BP.

Next, we investigated if\ninhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity in schizonts by 2-BP\ntreatment would inhibit RBC invasion by P. falciparum\nmerozoites. Late stage schizonts (at least 46 h post invasion\n(h.p.i.)) from highly sychronized cultures were treated with 2-\nBP and allowed to egress and reinvade RBCs. Treatment with 2-\nBP considerably reduced the number of new rings formed in\ncomparison to control cultures (Figure 3C). The viability of\ntreated parasites was determined by ﬂow cytometry using\ndihydroethidium.

The elutes of ABE were probed with anti-PfCDPK1 rabbit\nantiserum by Western blotting to detect changes in palmitoylation of PfCDPK1 in merozoites treated with 2-BP and JCP-174. 2-BP treatment\ncompletely abrogated palmitoylation of PfCDPK1 in merozoites.

Merozoites treated with either DMSO, 2-BP, or JCP-174 were fractionated into membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Anti-PfCDPK1\nrabbit sera were used to detect PfCDPK1 in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions by Western blotting. 2-BP treatment reduces PfCDPK1 in merozoite\nfraction whereas JCP-174 shows modest enhancement of PfCDPK1 in membrane fraction. Membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were also probed with\nanti PfMSP119 rabbit sera and anti NapL rabbit sera to detect subcellular distribution of MSP1-19 (a membrane marker) and NapL (a cytoplasmic\nmarker) in merozoites treated with DMSO, 2-BP, or JCP-174.

To investigate protein\npalmitoylation, acyl resin assisted capture (acyl RAC) method\nwas used to capture palmitoylated proteins from merozoites\nincubated in IC or EC buﬀer. Acyl RAC is based on the principle\nof covalent chromatography and captures palmitoylated\nproteins on a thiopropyl Sepharose resin by forming mixed\ndisulﬁdes with nascent thiols generated by hydroxylamine\ntreatment.40,41\nHydroxylamine at neutral pH cleaves the thioester bond\nbetween palmitic acid and cysteine residues to generate nascent\nthiols, which can form disulﬁde linkages with thiol groups\navailable in thiopropyl sepharose resin. Proteins bound on\nthiopropyl sepharose resin were eluted with β-mercaptoethanol\n(β-ME) and analyzed by western blot with rabbit anti-PfCDPK1\nsera to quantify palmitoylated PfCDPK1 in merozoites exposed\nto EC or IC-like conditions. It was found that the amount of\npalmitoylated PfCDPK1 is higher in merozoites exposed to EC\nbuﬀer compared to merozoites exposed to IC buﬀer (Figure\n4A). Next, we investigated whether the treatment of merozoites\nwith 2-BP and JCP-174 had any eﬀect on palmitoylation of\nPfCDPK1. We used acyl biotin exchange (ABE), a standard\nmethod to capture palmitoylated proteins that depends on\nexchange of palmitic acid residues on thiols by thiol reactive\nbiotin and enrichment on streptavidin agarose.40−42 Acyl biotin\nexchange was performed on merozoites treated with 2-BP and\nJCP-174 followed by western blot of ABE elutes with rabbit anti-\nPfCDPK1 antisera. PfCDPK1 was not detected in ABE elutes of\n2-BP treated merozoites suggesting inhibition of palmitoylation\nof PfCDPK1 by 2-BP (Figure 4B), whereas treatment with JCP-\n174 resulted in modest enhancement of PfCDPK1 palmitoyla-\ntion (Figure 4B).\nPalmitoylation of PfCDPK1 Is Required for Its Local-\nization to Merozoite Plasma Membrane. To understand\nthe biological signiﬁcance of PfCPDK1 palmitoylation, we\nanalyzed the subcellular localization of PfCDPK1 in merozoites\ntreated with 2-BP or DMSO. We performed Western blot\nanalysis to detect PfCDPK1 in membrane and cytoplasmic\nfractions in merozoites treated with 2-BP or DMSO. 2-BP\ntreatment drastically reduced abundance of PfCDPK1 in the\nmembrane fraction, while treatment with JCP-174 had no\nprominent eﬀect in comparison to DMSO treated merozoites\n(Figure 5A). Moreover, to validate these ﬁndings further, we\nstudied the eﬀect of 2-BP on localization of PfCDPK1 by\nimmunoﬂuorescence imaging. Smears were prepared with\nmerozoites treated with 2-BP or DMSO and PfCDPK1 was\nlocalized by immunostaining with mouse anti-PfCDPK1 sera.\nRabbit anti-PfMSP119 sera was used to detect PfMSP119, which\nis a plasma membrane marker. 2-BP treatment disturbed the\nmembrane localization of PfCDPK1 at the merozoite plasma\nmembrane but had no eﬀect on the membrane localization of\nPfMSP-119, a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchored\nmerozoite surface protein (Figure 5B). The frequency of\nmerozoites with localization of PfCDPK1 at the merozoite\nmembrane and with disrupted localization was scored in\npresence/absence of 2-BP. Treatment with 2-BP increased the\nfrequency of disrupted PfCDPK1 localization at the merozoite\nsurface (Figure 5C). 2-BP and JCP-174 treatment did not\nchange the level of PfMSP119 in the membrane fraction (Figure\n5A and 5B). Together, these results demonstrate that\npalmitoylation of PfCDPK1 is required for its proper subcellular\nlocalization at the merozoite plasma membrane.\n■DISCUSSION\nProtein palmitoylation has recently emerged as an important\nPTM that is required at many stages during the life cycle of\nmalaria parasites. Most importantly, palmitoylation is required\nfor invasion of host cells by P. falciparum8 and the related\napicomplexan parasite T. gondii.33 Invasion is a complex process\nthat requires timely secretion of micronemes and rhoptries from\nfree merozoites. The role of second messengers such as calcium\nand cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) in microneme\nsecretion and RBC invasion via activation of parasite kinases\nsuch as PfCDPKs, PfPKG, and PfPKA has been studied in some\ndetail, but little is known about the role of PTMs such as\npalmitoylation in the invasion process. Here, we have analyzed\nprotein palmitoylation in free merozoites to explore its role in\nmicroneme secretion and RBC invasion. We have used CuAAC\nclick chemistry to image palmitoyl transferase activity (PAT) in\nP. falciparum merozoites. Click chemistry is a powerful tool that\nis becoming increasingly popular to study dynamic cellular\nevents such as nascent protein translation and post-translational\nmodiﬁcations such as palmitoylation, myristoylation, and\nisoprenylation.10−12,14 Click reactions are bio-orthogonal,\nwhich means they are not aﬀected by other chemical reactions\nor metabolites within cells. This is because click reactions such\nas copper catalyzed alkyne azide cycloadditions (CuAAC) are\ndriven by a high thermodynamic driving force and reaction\nbetween azide and alkyne moieties proceed rapidly without\nformation of any side products.32 To study protein palmitoy-\nlation, cells are metabolically labeled with clickable analogue of\npalmitic acid which can be either an azide or alkyne derivative of\nfatty acids. Here, we have used an alkyne derivative of palmitic\nacid known as 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODA) for labeling\nintraerythrocytic stages as well as merozoites. DHHC PATs\ncannot discriminate between natural palmitic acid and 17-ODA\nbecause they only diﬀer by the presence of an alkyne function\nbetween the 16th and 17th carbon atoms of 17-ODA. As a result,\n17-ODA is incorporated at native sites of palmitoylation in\nproteins.\nWe found that among all the intraerythrocytic stages, PAT\nactivity is highest in schizonts. A previous study demonstrated\nthat PfDHHC PAT-3, -5, -7, and -9 are expressed in blood\nstages.43 However, a global transcriptomic examination of\nP. falciparum blood stages demonstrated that transcription of\nPfDHHC PAT-1, -2, -3, and -7 increases sharply in late stage\nschizonts and merozoites.34 Although multiple PATs are\nexpressed in diﬀerent life cycle stages of malaria parasites, a\nnumber of PATs are essential for diﬀerent stages in the parasite\nlife cycle. For example, PbDHHC PAT-2 is required for blood\nstage growth and for ookinete morphogenesis.35 PbDHHC\nPAT-10 is required for sporogony and its genetic deletion leads\nto failure to form viable sporozoites.44 These results argue\nagainst functional redundancy of PATs despite the presence of\nmany homologous PATs in diﬀerent life cycle stages. This is\nfurther supported by the fact that diﬀerent PATs have distinct\nexpression proﬁles in diﬀerent life cycle stages suggesting that\nthey play speciﬁc roles in the biology of diﬀerent stages of the\nparasite.\nThe question about how a given PAT palmitoylates a\nparticular subset of proteins is an open area of research. It is\nbelieved that distinct subcellular localization may facilitate\nproximity or interaction with its cognate substrates. PAT activity\nACS Infectious Diseases\npubs.acs.org/journal/aidcbc\nArticle\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00321\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 379−392\n387\n\nin schizonts closely overlaps with the expression of PfPAT-1, -2,\n-3, and -7 in schizonts. This suggests that palmitoylation is more\nprevalent in schizont stages, which is in agreement with previous\nﬁndings8 that palmitoylation is required for schizont develop-\nment. Western blots of schizont lysates fractionated into\nmembrane and cytosolic fractions with polyclonal antisera\nraised against PfPAT-1, -2, -3, and -7 detects each of the PATs at\ntheir theoretical molecular mass in membrane fractions. Here,\nwe demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that PAT activity in free\nmerozoites is responsive to external signals and increases\nsigniﬁcantly on exposure to low [K+] as found in blood plasma.\nThese observations demonstrate that PAT activity is dynamic\nin merozoites and is regulated in response to natural\nphysiological signals such as low [K+]. This study does not\nprovide information on which of the PATs are activated in\nmerozoites and responsible for the microneme secretion during\ninvasion. Exposure of merozoites to low [K+] is known to trigger\nrelease of calcium from intracellular stores and generation of\nsecond messengers like cAMP, thus preparing merozoites for\ninvasion. A surge in PAT activity concomitant with these events\nsuggests that akin to phosphorylation, protein palmitoylation\nmay also be required for invasive competence of merozoites.\nSince microneme secretion is required for RBC invasion, we\ninvestigated if microneme secretion requires palmitoylation by\nperforming microneme secretion assays in the presence of 2-BP\nand JCP-174, inhibitors of PATs and acyl protein thioesterases\nor depalmitoylases, respectively. Microneme secretion assays\nwere performed using standard methods to detect the secretion\nof invasion ligands from micronemes under various conditions.\nInterestingly, we found that inhibition of protein palmitoylation\nby 2-BP blocks secretion of microneme marker PfAMA-1 and\ninhibition of acyl protein thioesterase by JCP-174 leads to\nenhancement of PfAMA-1 secretion by merozoites. We have\nalso used immunoﬂuorescence assays to detect translocation of\nPfAMA-1 to the merozoite surface. The translocation assay has\nvalidated the results from secretion assay and together these\nﬁndings conﬁrm that palmitoylation is required for microneme\nsecretion. Merozoites have a very brief span of viability after\negress from RBCs, and microneme secretion is a highly dynamic\nand rapid process. Treatment of merozoites with 2-BP inhibits\nPAT activity and microneme secretion within minutes.\nMoreover, we saw a severe eﬀect on invasion of parasites in\nthe presence of 2-BP consistent with its potent inhibitory eﬀects\non microneme secretion. Previous studies8,9,39 have identiﬁed\nPfCDPK1 as a palmitoylated protein in schizonts. CDPKs or\ncalcium dependent plant like kinases are important signaling\nmolecules that respond to changes in intracellular calcium in\nparasites. CDPKs are regulators of key events in the biology of\napicomplexan parasites. They have distinct stage speciﬁc\nexpression and subcellular localization. Overall PfCDPK1\nplays a major role in RBC invasion by merozoites. However,\nthe biological signiﬁcance of palmitoylation of PfCDPK1 was\nnot understood. We decided to investigate the palmitoylation of\nPfCDPK1 and its functional importance for invasion.\nPfCDPK1 undergoes myristoylation39 as well as palmitoyla-\ntion.8 Kinases that need to be active at the plasma membrane are\noften both myristoylated and palmitoylated. Many eukaryotic\nkinases serve as examples of this paradigm of dual\nacylation.19,20,24,26 Dual acylation secures stable association of\nkinases to the plasma membrane, since a single lipid anchor may\nbe insuﬃcient for strong hydrophobic interaction to bind the\nplasma membrane. The reversible nature of the palmitoyl anchor\nallows the target molecule to associate and dissociate from the\nmembrane based on its palmitoylation status.\nWe performed acyl biotin exchange chemistry on merozoites\nlysates to deﬁne the palmitoylation status of PfCDPK1. Acyl\nbiotin chemistry captures palmitoylated proteins by exchanging\ntheir acyl group (linked by a thioester bond to their cysteine\nthiols) with thiol reactive biotin such as HPDP-Biotin or (N-\n[6(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide.\nThis enables addition of a biotin aﬃnity tag that can be exploited\nto purify the palmitoylated proteins from a complex proteome\nsample on streptavidin beads. We found that PfCDPK1 is\npalmitoylated in merozoites resuspended in RPMI or low [K+]\nenvironment as expected but loses its palmitoylation when\nmerozoites are treated with 2-BP. This result is interesting\nbecause previous studies suggested that PfCDPK1 has a stable\npalmitoylation in schizonts that is resistant to 2-BP treatment.8\nFigure 6. Model for signaling mechanisms regulating microneme secretion and invasion in P. falciparum merozoites. Low [K+] acts as a signal that\nactivates the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, which leads to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in P. falciparum merozoites. A rise in intracellular\nCa2+ brings about the activation of downstream targets such as PfCDPK1 to trigger microneme secretion and invasion. Exposure to low [K+] also\nstimulates DHHC-palmitoyl transferase (PfPAT) activity in merozoites, which leads to increased palmitoylation of PfCDPK1. Palmitoylation of\nPfCDPK1 enhances its localization to the merozoite membrane, which is essential for PfCDPK1 to play its functional role in invasion. Mn:\nmicronemes; Rh: rhoptries; IP3: inositol triphosphate, IP3R: putative IP3 receptor, PIP2: phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate.\nACS Infectious Diseases\npubs.acs.org/journal/aidcbc\nArticle\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00321\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 379−392\n388\n\nOur results further conﬁrm that palmitoylation of PfCDPK1 is\ndynamic in merozoites. We reasoned that if the palmitoylation of\nPfCDPK1 is dynamic it may change when intracellular PAT\nactivity is stimulated in merozoites that are exposed to low [K+]\nbuﬀer. Using acyl resin assisted capture, which is a modiﬁed\nprotocol of acyl biotin exchange, we showed that the abundance\nof palmitoylated PfCDPK1 increases in merozoites exposed to\nlow [K+] buﬀer. This suggests that palmitoylation may facilitate\ninvasion and microneme secretion by regulating localization of\nkey regulatory proteins such as PfCDPK1. We explored the role\nof protein S-palmitoylation in localization of PfCDPK1 to the\nmerozoite membrane, Merozoites were treated with 2-BP and\nthe subcellular distribution of PfCDPK1 was compared in\nuntreated and treated samples by IFA and western blotting of\nmerozoite fractions. Even a brief treatment of merozoites with 2-\nBP severely aﬀects membrane localization of PfCDPK1.\nPalmitoylation is thus crucial for correct subcellular localization\nof PfCDPK1, which in turn is important for its functional role in\nregulation of microneme secretion during RBC invasion by\nmerozoites.\nOne of the ways palmitoylation mediates invasive competence\nof merozoites is by regulating the palmitoylation status of\nPfCDPK1 in response to external signals and hence the\nsubcellular localization of PfCDPK1 in merozoites. Together\nour ﬁndings have uncovered the role of protein palmitoylation in\ndetermining invasive ﬁtness of P. falciparum merozoites. We\nshow for the ﬁrst time that palmitoylation in merozoites is\nresponsive to external signals. We propose a model (Figure 6)\nwhere palmitoylation of PfCDPK1 is required for its localization\nto the merozoite membrane and its palmitoylation increases\nwhen merozoites are exposed to a low [K+] ionic environment.\nOur data suggest that apart from the requirement of calcium for\nits activation, PfCDPK1 also requires palmitoylation to facilitate\nits membrane association, which is critical for microneme\nsecretion and invasion.\nAlthough we have focused on PfCDPK1 as a key\npalmitoylated protein because of its established role in invasion\nand microneme secretion,18,37,38 we cannot preclude the\npossibility that many other palmitoylated molecules that are\nyet to be identiﬁed may also play key roles in invasion.\nFurthermore, despite the identiﬁcation of the dynamic nature of\npalmitoylation in merozoites, this study did not identify the\nPfDHHC PATs that are directly responsible for palmitoylating\nPfCDPK1. Our work suggests that PfDHHC PATs can be\nexploited as druggable targets in malaria parasite, Plasmodium\nfalciparum, given the key role of palmitoylation in blood stage\nbiology of malaria parasites. Identiﬁcation of key DHHC-PATs\nrequired for invasion or microneme secretion can pave a path for\ndeveloping novel chemotherapeutic targets that can be used to\ntarget parasite DHHC PATs with high selectivity.\n■CONCLUSION\nWe have applied chemical biology methods and CuAAC “click”\nchemistry to investigate the importance of protein palmitoyla-\ntion of P. falciparum merozoites in RBC invasion. We found that\npalmitoyl acyl transferases, PfPATs-1, -2, -3, and -7, are\nexpressed and active in P. falciparum schizonts. We demonstrate\nfor the ﬁrst time that palmitoylation in merozoites is required for\nmicroneme secretion and invasion and is sensitive to\nphysiologically relevant external signal of low [K+]. Exposure\nof merozoites to low [K+] was previously shown to be the signal\nthat triggers microneme secretion. We have demonstrated that\nexposure of merozoites to low [K+] activates PATs, which\npalmitoylates invasion related proteins such as PfCDPK1.\nInhibition of PAT activity by treatment of merozoites or\nschizonts with the PAT inhibitor, 2-BP, prevents localization of\nPfCDPK1 to the membrane and inhibits microneme secretion\nand RBC invasion. These observations identify PfPATs as\npotential targets for development of inhibitors to block blood\nstage growth of P. falciparum.\n■METHODS\nParasite Culture. P. falciparum, 3D7 was cultured by the\nmethod of Trager and Jensen45 with some modiﬁcations.46\nParasite cultures were maintained in O+ erythrocytes at 1−2%\nhematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, USA)\nsupplemented with 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen, USA), 25\nmg/L hypoxanthine (Sigma), 10 mg/L Gentamycin (Sigma),\nand 25 mM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma). The cultures were\nmaintained at 37 °C under mixed gas environment comprising\nof 5% CO2 and 5% O2 and 90% N2. The parasite culture was\nsynchronized by treatment with sorbitol (5% w/v) twice in each\ncycle to achieve tight synchrony.\nIsolation of P. falciparum Merozoites and Microneme\nSecretion Assays. P. falciparum cultures were synchronized by\nsorbitol treatment as mentioned above. When majority of\nparasites were in late schizont stages, parasites were resuspended\nin buﬀer mimicking intracellular ionic conditions (IC buﬀer\n−140 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 25\nmM HEPES, pH 7.2) at 37 °C and allowed to egress. Cultures\nwere centrifuged for 5 min at 2600 rpm in an Eppendorf 5810R\ncentrifuge to separate released merozoites from unruptured\nschizonts and uninfected erythrocytes. Supernatants containing\nfree merozoites were then transferred into fresh tubes and\ncentrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min to pellet down free\nmerozoites. The merozoites were then quickly resuspended in\nRPMI 1640 medium or buﬀers mimicking intracellular (IC) or\nextracellular (EC) ionic conditions. The IC and EC buﬀers have\nfollowing compositions: IC buﬀer −140 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl,\n1 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2; EC\nBuﬀer −5 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA,\n5.6 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2.\nGenerating Antisera.

Mice were immunized with 50 μg of each peptide-\nKLH conjugate emulsiﬁed in Freund’s complete adjuvant for\nprimary immunization followed by booster doses on 14th, 28th,\nand 56th days with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Terminal\nbleeds were collected on 87th day and sera obtained were used\nfor Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence assays (IFA).\nAntisera were raised against recombinant PfCDPK1 and\nPfAMA1 in New Zealand white rabbits and Balb/c mice using\nfull length proteins formulated in complete and incomplete\nFreund’s adjuvant. 100 μg of puriﬁed recombinant protein was\nused for each rabbit per dose and 25 μg was used for each mousv\ne per dose following same immunization schedule as mentioned\nabove.

ABE was performed following the\nstandard protocol.42 Brieﬂy, for ABE, merozoites were lysed in\nice cold lysis buﬀer (150 mM NaCl, 1.7% Triton X-100, 50 mM\nTris-Cl, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (freshly\nprepared in ethanol) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).\nThe lysate was brieﬂy sonicated and centrifuged to isolate total\nproteins in supernatant. The supernatant was precipitated using\nmethanol-chloroform and was resolubilized with gentle shaking\nin 4% SDS buﬀer (4% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, 5 mM EDTA),\nsupplemented with 50 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, freshly\nprepared in ethanol) for 1 h at room temperature. The residual\nNEM was removed by two sequential chloroform−methanol\nprecipitation steps. The protein pellet was ﬁnally dissolved in 2%\nSDS buﬀer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF).\nThe protein concentration in each sample was determined using\nbicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. Each protein sample\nwas divided into two equal halves. One half was treated with 5\nvolumes of hydroxylamine buﬀer (+HA) (0.7 M hydroxylamine,\n1 mM N-[6(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-\npropionamide (HPDP-biotin), 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM\nPMSF, pH 7.4) and the other half was treated with 5 volumes\nof buﬀer lacking HA (−HA), (50 Tris-Cl, 1 mM HPDP-biotin, 1\nmM PMSF, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 1 h. Hydroxyl-\namine was prepared fresh and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with\nNaOH. The samples were precipitated twice to remove\nunreacted biotin, resolubilized in 2% SDS and captured on\nStreptavidin-agarose.42\nAcyl resin assisted capture (acyl RAC) is a modiﬁcation of\nABE chemistry where acylated proteins are captured on\nthiopropyl Sepharose resin matrix, which reacts covalently\nwith proteins containing thiol groups under mild conditions and\nforms mixed disulﬁdes. This is an example of covalent\nchromatography, the bound thiol containing molecules can be\neluted from the matrix by reducing the disulﬁde linkages\nbetween the resin and protein using reducing agents like 2-βME\nor DTT (50−100 mM).\nCuAAC Click Chemistry in Merozoites. Freshly egressed\nmerozoites were resuspended in IC or EC buﬀer supplemented\nwith 17-ODA (100 μM) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to\nallow incorporation of 17-ODA. The cells were washed three\ntimes with cold Dulbecco’s phosphate buﬀer saline and smears\nwere prepared. The labeled cells were ﬁxed with chilled\nmethanol for 10 min then further permeabilized with 0.1%\nTriton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Fixed cells\nwere washed three times with PBS and CuAAC click reaction\nwas performed on ﬁxed smears in 100 μL of click reaction\ncocktail by sequentially adding 2 μL of Oregon Green 488 azide\n(Invitrogen, ﬁnal concentration 0.1 mM), 2 μL of 0.1 mM tris(2-\ncarboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) solution and 2 μL of 0.1 mM\nCuSO4 solution in 94 μL of PBS. The reaction was allowed to\ntake place for 30−45 min in dark at room temperature. The\nslides were mounted with Prolong anti-Fade mounting reagent\n(Life Technologies) and analyzed using a Nikon A1-R confocal\nmicroscope. The raw ﬁles were processed using NIS image\nanalysis software. To monitor PAT activity in intraerythrocytic\nstages using click chemistry, synchronized P. falciparum blood\nstage cultures were resuspended in cRPMI buﬀer supplemented\nwith 17-ODA (100 μM) and incubated for 4−6 h to allow\nincorporation of 17-ODA. The smears prepared from the\nlabeled parasites were ﬁxed and permeabilized as mentioned\nabove. CuAAC chemistry was performed on these smears as\ndescribed above. The slides were prepared as mentioned and\nimages were acquired on a Nikon A1-R confocal microscope and\nanalysis was performed using NIS image analysis software.\nImmunoﬂuorescence Assays. Smears prepared from\nP. falciparum cultures were air-dried for 30 min in a laminar\nﬂow hood and ﬁxed with cold methanol at −20 °C for 15 min.\nThe smears were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in\nphosphate buﬀered saline (PBS) and washed with PBS and PBS\nwith 0.1% Tween (PBST). Slides were blocked overnight in 4%\nBSA (w/v) in PBS at 4 °C. The smears were then incubated with\nanti PfPAT mouse antisera at 1:75 dilution in PBS containing\n1% BSA to detect expression of PfPATs in various erythrocytic\nstages. The smears were washed 3 times with PBS and once with\nPBST, followed by incubation with goat antimouse IgG\nantibody conjugated to Alexa 488 diluted 1:250 in 1% BSA in\nPBS for 1 h at 24 °C. Smears were washed 3 times with PBS and\n2 times with PBST. The smears were mounted with Prolong\nanti-Fade (Life Technologies) and observed by confocal\nmicroscopy.\nIsolated merozoites treated with 2-BP or DMSO were washed\nwith PBS and smears were prepared from the respective\nmerozoite suspensions and ﬁxed in cold methanol at −20 °C for\n10 min. Smears were further permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v)\nTriton X-100 in DPBS for 20 min at 24 °C with rotation,\nfollowed by blocking in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS overnight or at 24 °C for 3 h. Smears\nwere incubated with mouse anti-PfCDPK1 sera (1:100 dilution)\nand rabbit anti-PfMSP-119 sera diluted 1:250 in 1% BSA in PBS\nfor 1 h at 24 °C. The smears were washed as described above and\nthen incubated with secondary antibodies, goat antimouse IgG\nantibody conjugated to Alexa 594 for PfCDPK-1 and goat anti-\nrabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 for PfMSP119.\nSlides were washed and mounted with DAPI antifade before\nanalysis.\nFor PfAMA-1 translocation assay, the merozoites treated with\nDMSO in EC or 2-BP in EC were air-dried and ﬁxed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde in PBS. The ﬁxed smears were blocked\novernight at 4 °C with 3% BSA in PBS. Smears were incubated\nwith rabbit anti-AMA-1 sera (1:100 dilution). The smears were\nwashed as described above and then incubated with secondary\nantibody, goat antirabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 488\n(1:300 dilutions) for PfAMA-1. Slides were washed and\nmounted with DAPI antifade before analysis as mentioned\nearlier.\nStatistical Analysis. The statistical analysis for the plots was\nperformed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Click chemistry\nimaging of ﬂuorescent merozoites/intraerythrocytic parasites\nwas analyzed by one-way ANOVA test, and P ≤0.05 was\nconsidered signiﬁcant. The graphs were plotted with mean ± SD\nof the corresponding values. The values for relative intensity of\nbands in Western blots for microneme secretion and acyl RAC\nexperiments were analyzed using ImageJ (Fiji 2.0) and\nstatistically analyzed using unpaired t test. P ≤0.05 was\nconsidered signiﬁcant.\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nsı Supporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00321.\nFigure S1: Proﬁling of PAT activity in P. falciparum rings,\ntrophozoites and schizonts labeled with 17-ODA using\nCuAAC click chemistry; Figure S2: Immunoﬂuorescence\nassay to detect PfPATs in P. falciparum rings, trophozoites\nACS Infectious Diseases\npubs.acs.org/journal/aidcbc\nArticle\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00321\nACS Infect.

In\nMTs, GTP hydrolysis triggers structural changes in the lattice, which are responsible for interaction\nwith regulatory factors. The stabilizing GTP-cap is a hallmark of MTs and the mechanism of the\nchemical-structural link between the GTP hydrolysis site and the MT lattice is a matter of debate.\nWe have analyzed the structure of tubulin and MTs assembled in the presence of fluoride salts that\nmimic the GTP-bound and GDP.Pi transition states. Our results challenge current models because\ntubulin does not change axial length upon GTP hydrolysis. Moreover, analysis of the structure of\nMTs assembled in the presence of several nucleotide analogues and of taxol allows us to propose\nthat previously described lattice expansion could be a post-hydrolysis stage involved in Pi release.\nIntroduction\nMicrotubules (MTs) are ubiquitous cytoskeletal polymers built from a/b-tubulin heterodimers that\nassemble into a pseudo-helical cylinder. They are responsible for essential processes during cell\ngrowth and division, including chromosome segregation, intracellular transport, cell support and\nmotility (Desai and Mitchison, 1997). MTs perform these functions by serving as scaffolds for other\nproteins and engaging mechanical forces through their dynamic behavior (Gigant et al., 2000;\nKoshland et al., 1988). Due to its central role in cell biology, tubulin is a reference target for antitu-\nmor drugs that modulate protein dynamics. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of\ntubulin activation and deactivation is crucial to designing more effective compounds that overcome\ncell resistance and lower the toxicity of compounds in clinical use.\nTubulin exists in two different conformations related to its polymerization state: curved (depoly-\nmerized)\nand\nstraight\n(assembled\ninto\nMTs)\n(Buey\net\nal.,\n2006;\nGigant\net\nal.,\n2000;\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155.

The binding and hydrolysis of guanosine nucleotides rule\nthe polymerization-depolymerization of tubulin through chemical-linked conformational stages.\nGDP-tubulin remains inactive in the cytoplasm and the GTP exchange at the exchangeable site (E)\non b-tubulin activates the a/b-heterodimers, providing interacting surfaces prone to the addition\nonto growing bent sheets or protofilaments (PFs) at the MT end (Chre´tien et al., 1995;\nMcIntosh et al., 2018). The formation of lateral contacts between PFs at the MT tip contributes to\ntubulin straightening (Nogales and Wang, 2006), which is key to creating a hydrolysis competent\nstate (Nogales et al., 1998; Oliva et al., 2004). GTP hydrolysis at the E-site in b-tubulin induces con-\nformational\nchanges\n(Alushin\net\nal.,\n2014)\ndriving\nthe\n‘peeling-off’\ndisassembly\nof\nMTs\n(Chre´tien et al., 1995; Mandelkow et al., 1991). MTs’ continuous growth and shrinkage generate\nthe motion of these filaments, which is known as dynamic instability (Mitchison and Kirschner,\n1984a) and involves transient polymer intermediates adopting various nucleotide and conforma-\ntional states, of which we are getting the first structural glimpses (Alushin et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,\n2015; Zhang et al., 2018). The GDP-bound tubulin forming the body of the MT has a compact,\nstraight and regular lattice, whereas the tip of the MT contains GTP- and GDP.Pi-bound tubulin mol-\necules, and is known as the GTP-cap. This growing MT end varies in size (Duellberg et al., 2016b)\nand decreases in stability with age due to GTP hydrolysis and/or Pi release (Carlier et al., 1984;\nDuellberg et al., 2016b; Duellberg et al., 2016a; Gardner et al., 2011; Mitchison and Kirschner,\n1984a; Padinhateeri et al., 2012). The GTP-cap prevents MT depolymerization but its lattice pat-\ntern is poorly understood. It has been described as having a tapered shape (Mandelkow et al.,\n1991) or as outwardly curved sheets (Atheton et al., 2018; Chre´tien et al., 1995; Guesdon et al.,\n2016), though a recent study suggests flared, curved PFs at growing MT ends (McIntosh et al.,\n2018). It is believed that when GTPase activity reaches the tip and no new capping tubulins are\nadded, MTs switch from growing to shrinking in a multi-step process (Schek et al., 2007;\nWalker et al., 1991) required for the GTP-cap to disappear.\nInsight into the nature of the GTP-cap is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms govern-\ning MT dynamics and developing new modulating compounds targeting MTs. Here, we address this\nquestion using a combination of high- and low-resolution structural techniques with a biochemically\ncontrolled in vitro system applied to tubulin and MTs. The use of multiple g-phosphate analogues\n(BeF3\n-, AlFx) and nucleotides (GMPCPP, GMPPCP, GMPCP) allows us to develop systems that model\nMTs in their GTP-bound, transitional (GDP.Pi) and metastable (GDP-bound) states. In this model, all\ntubulin states would be compacted, which contrast with the widely accepted model of an expanded\nGTP-lattice that would compact after GTP hydrolysis (Alushin et al., 2014). We further propose that\nif previously observed lattice expansion actually occurs during cap maturation, it happens at a post-\nhydrolysis stage, between the transitional (GDP.Pi) and the metastable GDP-bound states, being an\nexpanded intermediate conformational stage required for Pi release.\nResults\nPhosphate analogues mimic activation and transition states at the\nhydrolytic E-site\nAlFx and BeFx are small inorganic molecules that mimic the chemical structure of phosphate\n(Bigay et al., 1987) and can bind and activate GDP-bound proteins (Dı´az et al., 1997; Mittal et al.,\n1996). BeFx complexes are strictly tetrahedral due to the sp3 orbital hybridization, whereas AlFx is\nhexacoordinate (Coleman et al., 1994; Martin, 1988) and closely resembles the bipyramidal transi-\ntion state of phosphate. We combined structural and biochemical studies to validate and correlate\nthe complexes of GDP-tubulin with these g-phosphate analogues, in both GTP-activated (BeF3\n-) and\nGDP.Pi transition (AlF4\n-/AlF3) states.\nTo determine the crystal structure of GDP-tubulin bound to each of the g-phosphate analogues,\nwe used a tubulin complex with RB3 and TTL (Figure 1A), referred to T2R-TTL (Prota et al., 2013a).\nWe included a GDP exchange step during sample preparation (Dı´az and Andreu, 1993) to ensure\nthe GDP’s presence at the E-site. Before setting crystallization plates, we incubated the GDP-T2R-\nTTL complexes with either BeF3\n- or AlFx (prepared in situ from mixtures of AlCl3 and HKF2 to avoid\nAl precipitation) to produce GDP-T2R-TTL-BeF3\n- and GDP-T2R-TTL-AlFx complexes, respectively. We\nnoticed that BeF3\n- and AlFx cleared easily from the nucleotide binding pocket during crystals\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155.

After several attempts, we found the BeF3\n- and AlF3 moieties at the E-site of chains D and B\n(Figure 1A–B), respectively.\nThe GDP-BeF3\n- structure (Table 1, data collection and refinement statistics), shows the phosphate\nanalogue in a tetrahedral state at a distance from the b-phosphate that is similar to the distance\nobserved between the b- and g-phosphate atoms in the GTP-bound state (Figure 1D), and not fur-\nther as expected for the transitional GDP.Pi state (Wittinghofer, 1997). Consistent with reported\nGTP- and GMPCPP-bound tubulin structures, one Mg2+ ion coordinates both the b-phosphate and\nthe BeF3\n- in a position clearly different than that of GDP-bound tubulin structures (~4.5 A˚ apart,\nTTL\n_-tubulin\n_-tubulin\n`-tubulin\n`-tubulin\nA\nchain D\nchain C\nchain B\nchain A\nRB3\nB\nGDP\nMg2+\nBeF3\n-\nGDP\nMg2+\nAlF3\n-\nGDP\nMg2+\nAlF3\n-\nC\nH5\nMg2+\nE\nD\nMg2+\nN101\nMg2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\nS5\nS4\nH4\nT4\nT3\nT5\n‘out’ \nchain D\nT180\nD179\nS178\nT180\nD179\nS178\n‘in’ \nchain D\nGTP\nGDP\nPa\nBeF3\n-\nP`\nP_\nMg2+\n4.5Å\n‘out’ \n‘in’ \nT5\nT5\nchain B\nMg2+\nPa\nP`\nP_\nAlF3\n-\nMg2+\n2.77Å\nchain D\n‘out’ \nT5\n‘in’ \nT5\n‘in’ \nT5\nMg2+\nMg2+\nPa\nP`\nP_\nMg2+\nF\nGTP\nGTP\nGDP\nGDP\nT5\nT5\nGTP\nGDP\nGTP\nGDP\nCPP\nBeF\nGTP\nGDP\nAlF\nCPP\nGDP\nAlF\nMg2+\nFigure 1.

The GDP-BeF3\n- complex is stabilized via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges contacts with\nloops T1, T4, T6 (GDP) and T3 and T4 (BeF3\n-, Table 2). Importantly, loop T5 is in a ‘flipped-out’ con-\nformation, leaving D179 exposed to the solvent and putting T180 closer to N101 in loop T3\n(Figure 1C–D) as shown previously in GTP-bound tubulin (Nawrotek et al., 2011). Thus, our results\nsuggest that BeF3\n- is a g-phosphate analogue that mimics tubulin’s GTP-bound state in the curved\nconformation, and not a GDP.Pi or intermediate transition state of hydrolysis.\nThe AlCl3/HKF2 mixtures we used produce roughly ~50% AlF3 and ~50% AlF4\n- (Goldstein, 1964),\nand the related moiety was modeled as AlF3 (Table 1, Figure 1B). Strikingly, this analogue did not\noccupy the position equivalent to the g-phosphate as observed in other ‘classic’ GTPase structures\nof the GDP-AlF3 complex (e.g. PDB 2ngr, 1grn, 2b92, 2g77, 4jvs and 4iru).

AlF3 was further stabilized through\ninteractions with loops T2 and T3 and a-phosphate. We hypothesize that this configuration likely\nrepresents a transitional stage of Pi release, where the Mg2+ ion removes the g-phosphate while\nmoving to a new coordination position between a- and b-phosphates. Loop T5 in chain B is blocked\ndue to tubulin axial contacts (Figure 1A); however, at chain D, this loop refined in a dual conforma-\ntion during the structure model-building: 57% in GTP-like ‘flip-out’ and 43% in GDP-like ‘flip-in’ con-\nformations (Figure 1F, comparison with GTP- (black) and GDP-bound (gray) structures). Since, we\ndid not find any extra density at this chain denoting the presence of the analogue, we presume that\nvery likely the AlF3 or AlF4\n- washed out and we captured loop T5 on its way back to the GDP-bound\nconformation.\nPhosphate analogues induce tubulin activation upon assembly into MTs\nWe analyzed the effect of g-phosphate analogues on tubulin activation through time-course turbidity\nexperiments in which we measured the assembly of MTs from fully substituted calf-brain GDP-tubu-\nlin in the presence of increasing BeF3\n- or AlFx concentrations (37˚C, no GTP added). Notice that our\nexperiments were performed in MES buffer to avoid any competition effect of the commonly used\nphosphate buffer with the analogues (Dı´az and Andreu, 1993). In this buffer condition, tubulin\nassembly requires glycerol under GTP (control experiments) or g-phosphate analogues conditions,\nalthough GMPCPP does not require glycerol to induce assembly. In the presence of BeF3\n- GDP-\ntubulin activation occurred at analogue concentrations above 1 mM (Figure 2A), suggesting a bind-\ning constant on the scale of mM. The polymerization curves also revealed that longer lag times occur\nwith BeF3\n- compared to GTP, indicating that nucleation is less efficient in the presence of GDP-\nBeF3\n-. This finding is also supported by the observation of fewer and longer MTs than in GTP control\nexperiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). However, we found that the equilibrium constant\nof addition of a tubulin dimer to the MT end is conserved as is shown by the fact that critical concen-\ntration (Cr) values (Figure 2B, 3.2 ± 0.4 mM vs. 2.9 ± 0.4 mM in GTP) remained similar across various\nBeF3\n- concentrations. Also, increasing Mg2+ concentration had a similar effect on the assembly under\nGDP-BeF3\n- and GTP conditions, displaying similar slopes in the Wyman plot (0.37, Figure 2C). Thus,\nGDP-BeF3\n- behaves like a GTP-bound state with slower MT kinetics. Likewise, AlFx induced tubulin\nactivation with a binding constant in the mM range (Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B),\nwhich might reflect the fact that part of the molecules had their loop T5 in a GTP-bound conforma-\ntion according to the crystal structure of AlF3 tubulin complexes. Previous studies showed similar\nequilibrium binding constants of addition to the MT, regardless of AlFx concentration and the clear\ncompetition between both AlFx and BeF3\n- for the same site on MTs (Carlier et al., 1988). These find-\nings suggest that, (i) both g-phosphate analogues likely display equivalent biochemical properties\nand; (ii) AlFx might occupy the g-phosphate site on the straight tubulin conformation.\nTable 2.

BeF3\n- inhibits MT disassembly at concentrations between 100–\n500 nM (Figure 2E) and hence, we estimate that the affinity of this g-phosphate analogue for\nstraight tubulin in assembled MTs (nM range, Figure 2E) is about three orders of magnitude higher\nthan that for the curved GDP-bound, soluble protein (mM range, Figure 2A). These values correlate\nwith those previously observed for Ras-like small GTPases where the binding affinity of BeF3\n- is in\nthe mM range (Dı´az et al., 1997), but increases to the mM range with the addition of the GTPase\nActivating Protein (GAP, Mittal et al., 1996). Interestingly, MTs were far more stable at BeF3\n-con-\ncentrations > 10 mM (i.e. the depolymerizing effect of non-physiological low temperatures disap-\npeared, Figure 2E) likely because BeF3\n- is retained at the g-phosphate pocket, providing a stable\nMT conformation in the absence of Pi release. When performing similar experiments to discern AlFx\naffinity to straight polymerized tubulin, we found that it is at least two orders of magnitude higher\nthan this for the curved state because MTs were fully stabilized at the lower AlCl3 concentration we\nused, 50 mM (Figure 2F) and tubulin activation upon assembly still required 0.5 mM AlCl3\n(Figure\n2D).\nUnfortunately,\nAl3+\ncontamination\nin\nthe\nglass\nand\nnucleotides\nsolutions\n(Sternweis and Gilman, 1982) prevented us from determining the strength of the interaction\n(Figure 2F).\nPhosphate analogues reveal lattice features for the GTP/GDP.Pi-bound\nstates\nWe used X-ray fiber diffraction of aligned filaments in solution to determine the structural details of\nMTs in various nucleotide-bound states, which gave us the direct correlation between biochemical\nand\nstructural\ndata.\nWe\nperformed\nquick\nshear-flow\nalignment\nusing\nmethylcellulose\n(Sugiyama et al., 2009) at a constant, physiological temperature of 37˚C, which allowed us to avoid\ntemperature-related variations in axial repeat and filament diameter (Kamimura et al., 2016). We\nchose this technique because of the swiftness of getting results related to both the boundaries of\nthe MT wall from the equatorial diffraction, and the axial repeats from the meridional diffraction\n(Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Amos and Klug, 1974; Andreu et al., 1992). Importantly, in these\nexperiments, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for the equatorial signals is very high because data\nincludes the average of tens of millions of individual MTs. Therefore, we have estimated for the first\ntime, the fraction of MT subpopulations according to their number of PFs (Figure 3—figure supple-\nment 1, Materials and methods) using the J04 + JN1 signals.\nWe first studied MTs polymerized in the presence of either 1 mM GTP (GDP-MTs, due to GTPase\nactivity) or 1 mM GTP + 100 mM taxol (GDP-Tx-MTs) to analyze two known lattice conformations;\ncompacted and expanded (Alushin et al., 2014; Kellogg et al., 2017). Under both experimental\nconditions, we found an axial tubulin repeat of 4 nm (Figure 3A, lines gray and brown and Fig-\nure 3—figure supplement 2). However, the 1 nm layer line, which is an harmonic of the 4 nm layer\nline, showed variations on their peaks distribution (Figure 3A, inset) indicating differences on the\naverage monomer axial spacing between GDP-MTs and GDP-Tx-MTs. The existence of a second\nweaker set of ~8 nm layer lines on GDP-Tx-MTs further confirmed variations on the axial spacing\nbetween a- and b-tubulin. These experiments did not distinguish between intra-dimer (a-b) and\ninter-dimer (b-a) distances, but the averaged estimations of monomer lengths are similar to cryo-EM\nmeasurements (Figure 4E) and published cryo-EM structures (Alushin et al., 2014; Kellogg et al.,\n2017): 4.06 nm vs. 4.01 nm for GDP-MTs and 4.18 nm vs. 4.08 nm for GDP-Tx-MTs. Otherwise, the\nanalysis of the equatorial diffraction showed similar diameters for GDP- and GDP-Tx-MTs (Table 3,\nFigure 2 continued\nline) and in the presence of increasing concentrations of BeF3\n- (100 nM, 500 nM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 50 mM; from light to dark blue) showing the\nstabilization effect of the analogue.

The PF number has no effect on the longitudinal spacing\n(Alushin et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), but does affect the MT helical twist (Chre´tien and Wade,\n1991). Notice that in our fiber diffracting images the 4 nm layer line is slightly curved, which could\nbe related to the super-twist existing in MTs with skewed PFs (Chre´tien and Fuller, 2000). However,\nwe relate this effect to a partial (2–3˚) misalignment by shearing. Despite such differences, GDP- and\nGDP-Tx-MTs displayed very alike PFs lateral spacing (Table 3), supporting the equivalent lateral con-\ntacts found in the aforementioned cryo-EM structures.\nSecond, we measured the main features of MTs polymerized in the presence of BeF3\n- or AlFx. We\nanalyzed both, MTs polymerized using g-phosphate analogues (Figure 2A and D) as well as MTs\nassembled from GTP and stabilized by these same salts (Figure 2E and F), and found no substantial\ndifferences (Table 3). Our experiments support that GDP-BeF3\n- mimics the GTP-bound state. In\naddition, MTs stoichiometrically incorporate Be7 (Carlier et al., 1988) so, all the subunits within\nBeF3\n--MTs must be in the GDP-BeF3\n- state. Strikingly, these MTs did not show the 8 nm layer line\n(Figure 3A, line blue), denoting similar intra-dimer and inter-dimer interfaces (Table 3), a clear\nopposition to the expanded-lattice model of the GTP-bound state displayed by the widely accepted\nGTP-like analogue, GMPCPP. The fitting of the 1 nm layer line revealed very subtle differences at\npeak maximum when compared to GDP-MTs, which could suggest minor differences on the axial\nspacing. The equatorial signals revealed that BeF3\n--MTs had a slightly smaller diameter and con-\ntained fewer average number of PFs than GDP-MTs (Table 3), mainly due to the lack of 14- and 15-\nPF MTs within the estimated population (Figure 3C).\nAlFx-MTs showed both, close intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances and roughly similar diameters\nto BeF3\n--MTs (Table 3), suggesting that there is not much of a difference between the GTP- and\ntransition states, either in overall MT dimensions or at the axial interactions. However, AlFx-MTs dis-\nplayed an additional PF on average (Table 3) due to the presence of 14- and 15-PFs MTs.\nTubulin twist in MTs is a consequence of subtle changes in lattice\nparameters\nCryo-EM was used to get additional details on GDP-, BeF3\n-- and GMPCPP-MTs. Since glycerol at\nhigh concentrations is incompatible with cryo-EM and that MT nucleation is difficult in BRB80 buffer\nin the absence of glycerol, we adopted a seeded assembly strategy. To avoid confusion between\nGMPCPP- and BeF3\n- lattices, we eluded the use of heterogeneous seeds such as those classically\nprepared in the presence of GMPCPP. Instead, we first prepared BeF3\n--MT seeds in the presence of\n25% glycerol, which were further diluted 1/10 in tubulin without glycerol. MT assembly was found to\nbe efficient under these conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), providing suitable conditions\nfor cryo-EM observations. Importantly, depolymerization at 4˚C showed a slower rate with respect to\nGDP-MTs, comparable to that observed with GMPCPP-MTs, further confirming that BeF3\n- stabilizes\nMTs (even in a non MES-glycerol buffer, Figure 2E).\nConsistent with the X-ray diffraction analysis, we found that BeF3\n--MTs revealed a majority of 12-\nPFs MTs (73.1%, Figure 3C), GDP-MTs contained essentially a mixed population of 13- and 14-PFs\nFigure 3 continued\npatterns, where arrows indicate the 4 nm and 8 nm peaks.

Strikingly, in the presence of BeF3\n-, 14-\nPFs MTs were arranged according to 4-start monomer lattices (14_4), and 13-PFs MTs displayed a\nmixed population of 13_3 and 13_4 MTs (to be reported elsewhere). While 13_3 GDP-MTs had their\nPFs essentially parallel to the MT axis (Figure 4A, left), both BeF3\n-- (Figure 4A, middle) and\nGMPCPP-MTs (Figure 4A, right) displayed systematically moire´ patterns, implying that their PFs are\nskewed relative to the MT axis. Determination of the axial spacing of tubulin monomers from the\nposition of the nominal ‘4 nm layer line’ on the Fourier transform (FFT) of straightened MT images\n(Figure 4B) confirmed that GDP- and BeF3\n--MTs displayed compacted lattices (40.95 A˚ and 40.65 A˚\nfor the MTs in Figure 4A, respectively), while GMPCPP-MTs displayed an extended lattice (42.13 A˚\nfor the 13_3 GMPCCP-MT in Figure 4A). Further analysis of the ‘4 nm layer line’ of these MTs\n(Figure 4C–D) and tilting experiments (not shown) revealed that BeF3\n--MTs have left-handed PFs\n(J10 is closer to the equator than J3), while GMPCPP-MTs have right handed PFs (J10 is farther apart\nfrom the equator than J3 [Chre´tien et al., 1996]). The average PF skew angles of 13_3 GDP-, BeF3\n--,\nand GMPCPP-MTs was found to be +0.10 ± 0.20˚, \u00000.27˚±0.17˚, and +0.33 ± 0.07˚, respectively\n(Figure 4E). These data can be interpreted in light of the lattice accommodation model\n(Chre´tien and Fuller, 2000; Chre´tien and Wade, 1991) that describes how the MT lattice accom-\nmodates changes in PF and/or helical start numbers, as well as modifications of MT lattice parame-\nters. The theoretical PF skew angle (\u0012the) of any MT type can be calculated according to Equation 9\n(Table 4). While 13_3 GDP-MTs are predicted to have a PF skew close to 0˚, an increase of the tubu-\nlin monomer spacing a from 40.9 A˚ to 42.1 A˚ induces a positive skew of +0.37˚ similar to that found\nin GMPCPP-MTs. Likewise, a slight modification of the inter-PF subunit rise r (Equation 10) from\nFigure 4 continued\nside and the other separated by blurred regions (noted ‘0’ for no internal fringes). The periodicity (L) of these moire´ patterns provides a direct measure\nof their PF skew angle \u0012 (Equation 8). (B) Comparison between the FFTs of the 13_3 GDP- vs. the 13_3 BeF3\n--MT (top), and the 13_3 GMPCPP- vs. the\n13_3 BeF3\n--MT (bottom) in A. The monomer spacing along PFs (a in Equation 9) is given by the position of the J3 layer line in Fourier space, that is\n40.95 A˚ , 40.65 A˚ , and 42.19 A˚ for the 13_3 GDP-, BeF3\n-- and GMPCPP-MTs in A, respectively. (C) Blow up of the equator and ‘4 nm layer lines’ in 13_3\nGDP- (top), BeF3\n-- (middle) and GMPCPP-MTs (bottom), corresponding to the boxed regions in B. In 13_3 GDP-MTs, J0 and JN overlap on the equator,\nand J3 and J10 overlap on the ‘4 nm layer line’ since the PFs are parallel to the MT axis. In 13_3 BeF3\n-- and GMPCPP-MTs, J13 is away from the equator\ndue to the PF skew. In BeF3\n--MTs, J10 is closer to the equator than J3, indicating that the PFs are left-handed (negative skew), while in GMPCPP-MTs,\nJ10 is farther apart from the equator than J3, indicating that the PFs are right-handed (positive skew), (Chre´tien et al., 1996). (D). 3D reconstructions of\nthe 13_3 MTs in A using TubuleJ (Blestel et al., 2009). The 3D reconstructions were elongated to the same size as the original images and presented\nfront face at a slight angle with respect to the MT longitudinal axis to emphasize the PF handedness in 13_3 GDP-MT (\u0012 = 0˚), BeF3\n--MT (\u0012 = - 0.20˚),\nand GMPCPP-MT (\u0012 = + 0.30˚). (E) Left: average PF skew angles of 13_3 GDP-MTs (\u0012 = + 0.10 ± 20˚, n = 15), BeF3\n--MTs (\u0012 = - 0.27 ± 0.07˚, n = 9), and\nGMPCPP-MTs (\u0012 = + 0.33 ± 0.11˚, n = 12). The average PF skew angle of 13_3 GDP_MTs must be lower since a majority of MTs did not show long\nenough moire´ patterns that could be measured at the high magnification used. Therefore, their average PF skew angle is likely closer to 0˚. Middle:\naverage monomer spacing along PFs in GDP-MTs (a = 40.93 ± 0.24 A˚ , n = 66), BeF3\n--MTs (a = 40.82 ± 0.20 A˚ , n = 103), and GMPCPP-MTs\n(a = 42.10 ± 0.13 A˚ , n = 25). All N_S microtubule types were included in the analysis. Right: inter-PF monomer tubulin rise in GDP-MTs (r = 9.37 ± 0. 13\nA˚ , n = 64), BeF3\n--MTs (r = 9.70 ± 0. 12 A˚ , n = 83), and GMPCPP-MTs (r = 9.45 ± 0. 07 A˚ , n = 24) determined using Equation 9.

These features were observed in almost all MTs analyzed in this study\n(see the 12_3 and 14_3 MTs in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E), although we note that MTs\nwith large changes in inter-PF rise were also observed in the presence of BeF3\n- (essentially 13_4 and\n14_4 MTs Chre´tien and Fuller, 2000). This analysis tells us that the positive PF skew observed in\nGMPCPP-MTs with respect to GDP-MTs is a simple consequence of the increase in tubulin spacing,\nmost likely due to the presence of the methylene group between the a and b phosphates of\nGMPCPP (see below), and not a conformational change induced by GMPCPP on tubulin.\nMT lattice expansion is not related to its GTP-bound state\nGMPCPP has traditionally been considered a good approximation of the GTP-bound state\n(Alushin et al., 2014; Hyman et al., 1992; Kamimura et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015), which led to\na model in which GTP-tubulin is in an expanded state at the tip of the MTs, and undergoes a com-\npaction followed by rotation between the a and b subunits upon GTP hydrolysis and Pi release,\nrespectively (Zhang et al., 2015). Our results suggest that the GTP-state (GDP-BeF3\n-) is compacted\n(Figure 1 and 3), and that the twist of tubulin in GMPCPP-MTs is a simple consequence of the\naccommodation of the lattice to the increase in size of GMPCPP-tubulin (Figure 4, Table 4). We\nthen asked what was the origin of the increase in size in GMPCPP-tubulin. To address this question,\nwe analyzed the structure of MTs assembled in the presence of GMPPCP that is similar to GMPCPP,\nbut with the methylene group sitting between b and g phosphates instead of a and b phosphates\nand GMPCP , which is the hydrolyzed version of GMPCPP. X-ray fiber diffraction analysis of\nGMPCPP-MTs and GMPPCP-MTs (Table 3) highlighted that both GTP analogues generated a similar\noverall cylinder structure showing equivalent PF number composition in which there were no 11-PF\nMTs and in which 13- and 14-PF MTs prevailed over 12-PF MTs (Figure 3C). GMPCPP-MTs displayed\na second set of ~8 nm layer lines (Figure 3A, Figure 3—figure supplement 2), indicating differences\nbetween a- and b-tubulin axial spacing, with a monomer repeat that nicely correlates with corre-\nsponding measurements from cryo-EM and recently published nude-MT cryo-EM structures\n(Zhang et al., 2018): 4.18 nm vs. 4.22 nm. By contrast, GMPPCP-MTs diffracting images did not\nshow the ~8 nm layer lines (Figure 3A, Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and hence, a non-expanded\nlattice and a MT structure equivalent to the BeF3\n-- and GDP-MTs (Table 3). Strikingly, the diffraction\npattern of GMPCP-MTs was similar to that of GMPCPP-MTs, showing the 8 nm layer line and an\nexpanded state (Figure 3, Table 3). Taken all together, these data tell us that: (i) lattice expansion is\nnot related to the presence of g-phosphate (i.e. a GTP-bound state) and (ii) the methylene in\nbetween the a and b phosphates in GMPCPP- and GMPCP-MTs is likely responsible for increasing\nthe size of the tubulin molecule.\nWe further found that MTs polymerized in the presence of 0.1 mM GTP + 100 mM taxol showed a\nnucleotide content of GTP(a):GDP(b), 1.08 ± 0.02: 1.04 ± 0.01, similar to other taxane site agents\n(Alushin et al., 2014; Field et al., 2018). Since GTP hydrolysis requires a close intra-dimer distance\nto fulfill the catalytic pocket (Nogales et al., 1998; Oliva et al., 2004), this result suggests that\ntaxol-induced expansion may happen after GTP hydrolysis. Interestingly, we found that BeF3\n-- and\nAlFx-MTs assembled in the presence of 100 mM taxol displayed compact lattices (Figure 3—figure\nsupplement 3, Table 5), bringing up that this drug cannot induce lattice expansion when the inter-\nplay between loop T7 and any of these g-phosphate analogues is retained at the inter-dimer\ninterface.\nTable 4.

Microtubule-Associated Proteins\n(MAPs) finely regulate MT function by stabilizing, guiding and destabilizing MT formation, as well as\nmediating both MT-MT and MT-protein interactions. Plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPS) are a type of\nMAP that stabilize or balance MTs; their functions rely on unique structural determinants at the lat-\ntice of the MT tip (Maurer et al., 2011; Maurer et al., 2012; Zanic et al., 2009). Thus, understand-\ning these specific structural features is crucial to gain insight into both the mechanisms of MT\nstabilization and the process of catastrophe.\nIncorporation of tubulin dimers into the MT tip forms a cap of not yet hydrolyzed GTP subunits\nthat re-arrange from a naturally bent state to a straight conformation for GTP hydrolysis. The region\nwhere this transitions occurs is called the GTP-cap, an uneven structure that can extend along hun-\ndreds of nanometers (Duellberg et al., 2016b) and ends in an open sheet or flared PFs at the tip\n(Chre´tien et al., 1995; McIntosh et al., 2018). Recent data point to the formation of one lateral\ncontact as the key interaction favoring length-wise PF growth (Mickolajczyk et al., 2019), which\noccurs 10–50 nm from the growing tip of the PF (~1–7 tubulin heterodimers (Erickson, 2019;\nMcIntosh et al., 2018). Tubulin straightening is not a single step change but a gradual process\n(Figure 5A), proportional to the increasing formation of lateral interactions in PFs (Brouhard and\nRice, 2018; Guesdon et al., 2016; Ja´nosi et al., 1998). In this process, GTPase activity occurs upon\ntubulin fully-straighten because this unique conformation allows the interplay of the a-tubulin cata-\nlytic loop (T7) and the g-phosphate at the E-site in b-tubulin (Nogales et al., 1998; Oliva et al.,\n2004), meaning the curled tip might be on the GTP-bound state. However, the transitional nature of\nGTP-cap architecture is difficult to overcome experimentally. Common approaches include the use\nof homogeneous model states of the MTs. In this work, we used a broad range of nucleotide-bound\nmodel MTs to understand their structure throughout the GTPase cycle (Figure 5A): active upon\nassembly GTP-bound (GDP-BeF3\n- and GMPPCP), transitional GDP.Pi (GDP-AlFx), metastable GDP\n(GTP-assembled MTs), and expanded (GMPCPP, GMPCP and GDP-Tx, see below). Our results\nmerge into a cap model (Figure 5B) in which each modeled MT mimics the structural transforma-\ntions of the filament during elongation, according to the natural biochemical changes caused by\nGTPase activity.\nThe existing cap model is based on the commonly accepted GMPCPP analogue as a bona fide\nmodel\nof\nthe\nGTP-bound\nstate\nand\nproposes\nan\ninitial\nright-handed,\nexpanded\nlattice\n(Alushin et al., 2014) that rapidly shrinks and changes twist direction upon hydrolysis during the\ntransition state (exemplified by nude GTP-g-S-MTs (Zhang et al., 2018) or doublecortin-bound\nGDP.Pi-MTs Manka and Moores, 2018). GMPCPP induces a far stronger assembly than that from\nGTP (Hyman et al., 1992), and MTs are stable because this GTP analogue is not easily hydrolysable,\ndespite of a normal oxygen link between b and g-phosphates. Whether the enhanced activity is due\nto the lower GTPase rate or the presence of a methylene link between a and b-phosphates is not\nclear, though it might be related to the expansion because taxol is also a strong tubulin assembly\ninducer and produces lattice expansion.\nOur approach included g-phosphate analogues that mimic the chemical structure of phosphates\non the activation and transitional states, which we structurally and biochemically analyzed on our\ntubulin system. These data support that, instead of the commonly accepted model, MTs in the GTP-\nbound state display a compact configuration (Figure 5B, blue). Control experiments with the GTP\nanalogue GMPPCP and with the GDP-analogue GMPCP, confirmed that expansion is due to the\npresence of the methylene link between a and b-phosphates rather than because of the presence of\nthe g-phosphate. In our proposed model, the lattice during the transition state of hydrolysis\n(Figure 5B, red) remains unchanged, despite a possible modification at the inter-PF angle. The\nTable 5.

(A) Schematic GTPase related conformational changes within the MT lattice. Tubulin activation upon\nGTP binding (TA) induces polymerization. During assembly (MTA), the formation of lateral contacts favors tubulin straightening, which allows GTP\nhydrolysis. GTPase activity drives MT through a transitional state (MTT), where the Pi is at the nucleotide-binding site before it is released. Expansion\n(orange) may be an intermediate transient step between GDP.Pi and GDP states, which may facilitates Pi release (MTE) and would be blocked in the\npresence of taxol. GDP-MT (MTM) shrinks through a ‘peeling-off’ disassembly in which tubulin reverts to the curved conformation, which is inactive (TI)\nin the GDP-bound state. (B) MT model illustrating specific lattice features of the GTPase cycle. This mosaic structure shows that: (i) the GTP-bound tip\n(blue) contains curved PFs/sheets that come together into a straight lattice due to the formation of lateral contacts, (ii) the post-hydrolysis GDP.Pi lattice\n(red) retains overall MT structure, (iii) hypothetically, lattice undergoes an energy-consuming expansion phase (orange) that contributes to Pi release,\nand (iv) in the GDP state (gray) subtle changes on the PF skew distinguish the metastable compact lattice or, (v) lattice reverts into its previous lower\nenergy state (compaction), preventing the structure from returning to the cap architecture.\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155.

It also has also been captured in GDP-MTs from yeast and worm\n(Chaaban et al., 2018; Howes et al., 2017; von Loeffelholz et al., 2017), suggesting that this lat-\ntice state might not be an artifact. Hence, when or where does this conformational change occur?\nWe propose a plausible explanation considering data arising from the interaction of EB proteins with\nMTs and recent results on taxanes-binding to the MT cap. EB proteins interact with both, curved\nand straight regions at MT ends (Guesdon et al., 2016), likely recognizing the MT compact lattice,\nbecause they bind preferentially to MTs in the presence of GDP-BeF3\n- and GTP-g-S over GMPCPP\n(Maurer et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015). Besides, EB proteins form an extended ‘comet’ that\ndecays exponentially with increasing distance from the tip (Seetapun et al., 2012), which highlights\ntheir gradual release from the MT wall, with no clue about the structural-chemical determinant induc-\ning such pattern of release. Additionally, it has been shown that fluorescent taxanes bind to the MT\nregion behind the EB ‘comet’ (Rai et al., 2019). From the thermodynamical point of view, if a drug\ninduces a specific conformation, it will bind with higher affinity to this kind of structure, because\nnone of the free energy of binding will be required to induce such conformational change. This\nimplies that taxanes should bind preferentially to expanded lattices because they do induce lattice\nexpansion (Alushin et al., 2014). Similarly, EBs might induce lattice compaction (their favored lattice\nstate) in GMPCPP-MTs, causing nucleotide hydrolysis (Zhang et al., 2018). Hence, it could be possi-\nble that the MT region behind EB-binding site would be expanded, favoring taxanes binding and\nEBs release. We show that MT lattice is compact among the tubulin GTPase cycle. Therefore, lattice\nexpansion, if existing, might be between two of the main nucleotides bound states (GTP, GDP.Pi\nand GDP). Since the presence of g-phosphate analogues (BeF3\n- or AlFx) reverts taxol-induced expan-\nsion (Figure 5A–B, orange), we speculate that expansion might be an intermediate state between\nthe MT’s cap (GDP.Pi) and core (GDP) regions, able to facilitate Pi release (Figure 5B). Note that, on\nthe stabilization experiments, the g-phosphate analogues immediately replace the released Pi and\nso, no expansion of the compact GDP lattice is needed to justify the biochemical stabilization\nobserved.\nConsidering the narrow region labeled by these taxanes (Rai et al., 2019), it could be argued\nthat lattice expansion might involve only few tubulin molecules likely randomly distributed, which\nhas precluded the detection of expansion on cryo-EM images of the MTs tips. If existing, lattice\nexpansion would be likely the point of no return for the GTP-cap as a stabilizing structure. Thereby,\nonce the MT compacts and returns to the GDP-bound state (Figure 5B, gray), the remaining energy\nstored in the lattice would be enough to exert the peeling-off disassembly of PFs, but below the\nthreshold for the MT to revert to the expanded state. Notice that the ‘peeling-off´ disassembly is\nhighly efficient and uses only 25% of the energy from the GTPase activity (Driver et al., 2017)\nBrouhard and Rice, 2018).\nThe GTP-cap is a unique structure that governs MT dynamics; our model depicts a mosaic archi-\ntecture that undergoes various maturation steps according to tubulin GTPase activity. While GTP\nbinding activates assembly, GTP hydrolysis produces energy, part of which could be used for Pi\nrelease, and limits the length of the cap. The presence of an expanded lattice in GDP-MTs of yeast\nand worm might be a consequence on the delay or inability to return to the compact state, which\ncould be related to the differences observed on lateral contacts between PFs (Chaaban et al.,\n2018). At the moment, we do not know how is the GTP-MT lattice on these organisms and addi-\ntional studies are necessary to confirm a compact-to-expanded conformational change upon Pi\nrelease, although we cannot rule out that MT lattice could be more expanded in other organisms dif-\nferent than mammals. Beyond this study, high-resolution structural studies will be crucial to analyze\nthe exact nature of protein-protein interactions at the tip of the cap and to fully understand the\nfeedback between structural modifications driven by partner proteins that otherwise are regulating\nMT dynamics.\nAccession codes\nData deposition: Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the reported crystal structures have\nbeen deposited at the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 6gze (BeF3\n-) and 6s9e (AlF3).\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155.

Alternatively fully substi-\ntuted GDP-tubulin was obtained from GTP-tubulin by hydrolysis. GDP tubulin was equilibrated in a\n20 \u0002 1 cm Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in MEDTA buffer with 3.4 M Glycerol. The nucleotide\ncontent of the protein was measured as above and was found to be 0.24 ± 0.02 mol GDP/mol tubu-\nlin and 1.75 ± 0.06 mol GTP/mol tubulin. The protein was diluted to 30 mM and supplemented with\n6 mM Mg+2 (final pH 6.5) to induce polymerization into MTs by incubating at 37˚C. The assembly\nwas monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm. Protein assembled into MTs (as checked by electron\nmicroscopy) and rapidly disassembled after hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide. Samples were taken\nat the peak of assembly (Sample A) and after complete disassembly (Sample B). The nucleotide con-\ntent of the protein was measured as above and was found to be 1.01 ± 0.02 mol GDP/mol tubulin\nand 0.99 ± 0.03 mol GTP/mol tubulin (Sample A) and 0.96 ± 0.04 mol GDP/mol tubulin and\n1.00 ± 0.03 mol GTP/mol tubulin (Sample B). Prior to assembly, tubulin samples were centrifuged at\n100,000 g, 4˚C, for 10 min using TL100.2 or TL100.4 rotors in a Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge to\nremove aggregates. GMPCP and GMPPCP tubulin preparation were performed by a two-step pro-\ntocol based on Mejillano et al. (1990). First, 20 mg of lyophilized calf brain tubulin were resus-\npended in PM buffer (80 mM K-PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothtreitol, 0.2 mM Tris, pH 6.8)\ncontaining 2 mM GTP and 1.5 mM MgCl2, in order to get the GDP bound to the protein substituted\nby GTP due to its higher affinity in the presence of Mg+2 ions (Correia et al., 1987). Then, the free\nMg+2 and GTP were removed by chromatography in a drained column of Sephadex G-25 (GE\nHealthcare) (6 \u0002 1 cm), equilibrated in PM buffer containing 50 nM of the desired analogue, two\ntimes washing steps by filtration using Amicon MWCO 50 (Merck-Millipore), and concentrated to\n700–800 ml. The protein was then passed through 0.45 mm cellulose acetate microfuge column filters\n(Costar) to remove aggregates. Then 5 mM of the desired nucleotide analogue was added to dis-\nplace the GTP bound (due to its lower affinity in the absence of Mg+2) and the protein was incu-\nbated for 30 min at 25˚C. The protein was washed and concentrated as before to 600–700 ml and\nfiltered again on a 0.45 mm cellulose acetate microfuge column filter to a final concentration 100–\n150 mM. After filtration, the protein was HPLC analyzed as described (Smith and Ma, 2002) and was\nfound to be 90% loaded with the desired nucleotide at the E-site. In order to induce MT assembly,\ntubulin was supplemented with 2 mM GMPCPP, GMPCP or GMPPCP and 3 mM MgCl2 prior to\npolymerization.\nCrystallization and crystal structure determination\nThe stathmin-like domain of RB3 and the chicken TTL protein preparations were done as described\npreviously (Prota et al., 2013b; Ravelli et al., 2004). For the T2R-TTL complex, tubulin (8 mg/mL),\nTTL (17 mg/mL) and RB3 (26 mg/mL) were mixed and concentrated (Amicon MWCO 10) at 4˚C to a\nfinal complex concentration of 20 mg/ml. The concentrated mixture was supplemented with 10 mM\nDTT, 0.1 mM GDP, 1 mM AMPCPP and 5 mM BeF3\n- (in T2RT- BeF3\n- complex), or 1.5 mM AlCl3 and\n2 mM HKF2, or 500 mM AlCl3, 2 mM HKF2 (in T2RT- AlFx complex), before setting crystallization\nexperiments. Initial crystallization conditions were determined from previous structures (Prota et al.,\n2014; Prota et al., 2013a; Prota et al., 2016) using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique with\na reservoir volume of 200 ml and a drop volume of 1 ml of complex and 1 ml of reservoir solution at\n20˚C. Crystal-producing conditions were further optimized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion\nmethod with a reservoir volume of 500 ml and a drop volume of 1 ml of complex and 1 ml of reservoir\nsolution. Native T2R-TTL-BeF3\n- complex was crystallized in 0.1 M MES/0.1 M Imidazole pH 6.5, 0.03\nM CaCl2/0.03 M MgCl2, 5 mM L-tyrosine, 8.8% glycerol, 5.5% PEG4000. T2R-TTL-AlFx complex was\ncrystallized in 0.1 M MES/0.1 M Imidazole pH 6.5, 0.03 M CaCl2/0.03 M MgCl2, 5 mM L-tyrosine, 5%\nglycerol, 5.5% PEG4000 500 mM AlCl3, 2 mM HKF2 (alternatively 1.5 mM AlCl3 and 2 mM HKF2 were\nused).

Molecular replacement was per-\nformed with PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007) using the previously determined structure (PDB 4o2b) as\na search model. Structures were completed with cycles of manual building in COOT (Emsley et al.,\n2010) and refined in PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010), which allowed the determination of alternative\nconformations on different residues at main chains. Data collection and refinement statistics are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. The ligand interfaces of this structure and other tubulin structures in the curved\n(PDBs 5xp3, 3ryh, 4i55) or straight (PDBs 3jat, 3jal, 3jar, 3jak, 6ecx) conformations were analyzed\nusing PDBe PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). Omit maps were calculated in PHENIX using Carte-\nsian annealing and harmonic retrains on the omitted atoms (BeF3\n- or AlF3).\nMicrotubule assembly and Cr determination\nTubulin (calf brain purified or fully GDP- exchanged as described above) was exchanged into MEDTA\nbuffer and mixed at a 60:40 ratio with a 8.5 M glycerol, 100 mM MES, 1 mM EDTA buffer pH 6.7\n(final buffer concentrations 100 mM MES, 3.4 M glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.6 mM GDP, pH 6.7).

The solutions were warmed up to 37˚C, and\nincubated as long as needed to reach polymerization equilibrium. The assembly was monitored by\nturbidity at a wavelength of 350 nm. Alternatively, the polymers formed were sedimented at\n100,000 g for 20 min in a TLA 100 rotor equilibrated at 37˚C. Supernatants were separated by aspi-\nration, and pellets were resuspended in a 1% SDS, 10 mM phosphate buffer. Tubulin concentration\nin pellets and supernatants was measured spectrofluorometrically by excitation at 280 nm and emis-\nsion at 320 nm (Buey et al., 2005) employing a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorometer (excitation and emis-\nsion slits, 5 nm) calibrated with standards of known concentration prepared from the same tubulin.\nApparent polymer growth equilibrium constants were estimated as the reciprocal of the critical con-\ncentrations for polymerization determined at several total protein concentrations (Oosawa, 1975).\nMT shear-flow alignment and X-ray fiber diffraction experiments\nX-ray fiber diffraction data were collected on beamlines BL11-NDC-SWEET and BL40XU of ALBA\n(Spain) and SPring-8 (Japan) synchrotrons.

GDP-tubulin was obtained from GTP-tubulin by\nhydrolysis as described above, and then supplemented with 1 mM GDP + 10 mM BeF3\n- or 1 mM\nGDP + 500 mM AlCl3 + 2 mM HKF2. All samples were incubated for 20 min at 37˚C to induce the\nmaximum fraction of polymerized tubulin, and then were mixed in a 1:1 vol ratio with PM buffer at 3\nmM MgCl2 containing 2% methylcellulose (MO512; Sigma-Aldrich). Final concentration of nucleoti-\ndes, salts and drugs were 1 mM GTP, 0.25 mM GMPCPP, 2.5 mM GMPCP/GMPPCP, 1 mM GTP +\n10 mM BeF3\n-, 1 mM GTP + 500 mM AlCl3 + 2 mM HKF2 (salts were not diluted because methylcellu-\nlose was further supplemented) and 100 mM taxol. Samples were centrifuged 10 s at 2000 g to elimi-\nnate air bubbles and were transferred to the space between a mica disc and a copper plate with a\ndiamond window in the shear-flow device (Figure 3—figure supplement 1, (Kamimura et al., 2016;\nSugiyama et al., 2009). The device was kept at 37˚C during measurements and the mica disc spun\nat 10 rps to achieve the shear flow alignment. Several experiments were recorded using different\nsample-to-detector distances and wavelengths, collecting 150 s exposure time images on a PILA-\nTUS3S-1M detector. Background images were acquired in the same conditions, using PM buffer con-\ntaining 3 mM MgCl2 with 1% methylcellulose without tubulin. A total of 16–24 diffraction images\nwere averaged for each condition and background subtracted using ImageJ (version 1.51j8; Wayne\nRasband, National Insitutes of Health, Bethesda, USA). Angular image integrations were performed\nusing the XRTools software (obtained upon request from beamline BM26-DUBBLE of the ESRF),\nwhere the spatial calibration was obtained from Ag-Behenate powder diffraction. For data analysis,\nwe considered MTs as cylinders with a three-start helical pattern. The diffraction pattern of MTs\ncomprises layer lines (l) each defined by a group of Bessel functions of order n. Their structural factor\nF in the reciprocal space (R) is described by Equation 1 (Klug et al., 1958):\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50155\n18 of 26\nResearch article\nStructural Biology and Molecular Biophysics\n\nFl;n R\nð Þ ¼ Jn 2prmR\nð\nÞf R\nð Þ\n(1)\nwhere Jn is the nth Bessel function, rm is the radius of a MT with m PFs and f(R) is the structural\nfactor of the sphere defined by Equation 2 (Malinchik et al., 1997):\nf R\nð Þ ¼ 4pr3\nt\nsin 2prmR\nð\nÞcos 2prmR\nð\nÞ\n2prmR\nð\nÞ3\n(2)\nThis expression is used to include the structural factor of the tubulin wall in the calculation where\nrt\nis the radius of the tubulin monomer considered as a sphere, with a value of 2.48 nm\n(Kamimura et al., 2016). For radial structural parameters (average MT radius, rm; average PF num-\nber, ma; and average PF distances, dm), we analyzed the central-equatorial intensity profile (l = 0)\n(Figure 3—figure supplement 1 blue line). The relationship between diffraction intensity and the\nstructural factor is represented in the expression Equation 3 (Amos and Klug, 1974; Cochran et al.,\n1952):\n<Il;n R\nð Þ> ¼ Fl;n R\nð Þ\n\f\f\n\f\f2\n(3)\nThe intensity of this layer line I(R) at a reciprocal distance (R) results from a MT mixed population\nwith different PF numbers (m), often from 10 to 15. Considering wm as the fraction of MTs with m\nPFs, the resulting intensity was deconvolved as the sum of intensities of individual structure functions\nFl;n (Equation 4)\nl;nðRÞ> ¼\nX\nm\nwmð\nX\nn\njFo;nðRÞj2Þ\n(4)\nIn the l = 0 layer line, diffraction intensity is explained by J0 and Jn where n = m (Oosawa, 1975).\nTherefore, from Equation 4 we obtain the following expression (Equation 5):\n<Il;mðRÞ> ¼\nX\nm\nwm ð F0;0 R\nð Þ\n\f\f\n\f\f2þ F0;m R\nð Þ\n\f\f\n\f\f2Þ\n(5)\nFrom Equation 1 and Equation 5 we derive the Equation 6:\n<Il;m R\nð Þ> ¼\nm\nX\nwm\nf R\nð ÞJ0 2prmR\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ2þ f R\nð ÞJm 2prmR\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(6)\nThis equation was used for iterative fitting by least squares of the experimental intensities using\nthe Solver function in Excel (Microsoft, 2010 version). For inter-PF distance determination (dm), rm\nwas used as the apothem of an m-apex MT in which the linear distance between them is calculated\naccording to Equation 7:\ndm rð Þ ¼ 2rmsin\np\nma\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(7)\nThe standard error of these calculated values was determined from the ratio between the experi-\nmental maximum intensities values of J0 and Jn and their standard deviation. For the determination\nof the average monomer lengths, we analyzed the intensity profile of the central-meridional signals\n(Figure 3—figure supplement 1, red line). The 4th harmonic of the first layer-line (l = 4)) was fitted\nto a single-peaked Lorentzian function using Sigma-Plot software (version 12.0), in which the position\nof the maximum of intensity corresponds to ¼ of the average monomer length at the reciprocal\nspace. The standard error was obtained from the standard deviation of the regression applied.\nNegative-staining and cryo-electron microscopy\nFor negative-stain experiments, samples of the assembled tubulin were routinely adsorbed to car-\nbon-coated Formvar films on 300-mesh copper grids, stained in 2% uranyl acetate and observed\nwith a JEOL JEM-1230 at 40,000 K magnification with a digital camera CMOS TVIPS TemCam-F416.\nFor cryo-EM experiments, tubulin was isolated from porcine brain by two cycles of assembly dis-\nassembly (Castoldi and Popov, 2003), followed by a final cycle in the absence of free GTP\n(Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984b). GDP-tubulin was obtained in BRB80 and stored at \u000080˚C before\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50155\n19 of 26\nResearch article\nStructural Biology and Molecular Biophysics\n\nuse. Spectrophotometry was used to determine suitable conditions for cryo-EM. GDP-MTs were\npolymerized at a final tubulin concentration of 40 mM in BRB80 (80 mM K-Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM\nMg2+, pH 6.8 with KOH), 1 mM GTP, 35˚C. GMPCPP-MTs were polymerized at 10 mM tubulin con-\ncentration in BRB80, 0.1 mM GMPCPP, 35˚C. GDP/BeF3\n--MTs were assembled using a seeded strat-\negy. GDP/BeF3\n--MT seeds were polymerized at 40 mM tubulin concentration in BRB80, 25% glycerol,\n20 mM NaF, 5 mM BeSO4-, 35˚C for 1 hr. MTs were sheared by sonication (30 s) followed by up-\nand-down pipetting, and were diluted 1/10 in pre-warmed tubulin at 40 mM with the same buffer\ncomposition but in the absence of glycerol, giving a final glycerol concentration of 2.5% suitable for\ncryo-EM experiments. The presence of aggregates was checked by switching the temperature to 4˚\nC once the MTs reached steady state. Cryo-EM grids were typically prepared after ~1 hr of assem-\nbly. Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) was added to the suspensions before polymerization to be used as\ninternal calibration standards. Four ml samples were pipetted and deposited at the surface of holey-\ncarbon coated grids (R3.5/1, Quantifoil) in an automatic plunge freezer (EM-GP, Leica) under tem-\nperature and humidity controlled conditions. Grids were stored in LN2 before use. Specimen grids\nwere loaded onto a cryo-holder (model 626, Gatan), and were observed in a 200 kV electron micro-\nscope (Tecnai G2 Sphera, FEI) equipped with a LaB6 cathode and a 4k \u0002 4 k CCD camera (USC4000,\nGatan). Images were taken at a nominal magnification of 50,000 X using a \u00001.5 mm to \u00003 mm defo-\ncus range. Images were further calibrated using the 2.3 nm layer line of the TMVs added to the sus-\npensions, which gave a pixel size of 2.16 ± 0.01 A˚ (n = 27). Individual MT images were straightened\nusing TubuleJ (Blestel et al., 2009), which allows a semi-automatic determination of MT centers\nusing the phase information on J0 in the FFT of the MT images. The PF skew angle ‘\u0012exp’ was deter-\nmined from the length of the moire´ patterns (L, or ½ L in the case of 13_3 MTs) in the J0+JN filtered\nimages of the MTs using:\n\u0012exp ¼ sin\u00001 dx\nL\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(8)\nwhere dx denotes the lateral separation between PFs (dx = 48.95 A˚ ). This latter value was esti-\nmated from the increase in MT diameter with PF number in 3D maps of MTs (Sui and Downing,\n2010). The sign of \u0012exp was deduced from the analysis of the respective positions of JS and JN-S on\nthe ‘4 nm layer lines’ on the FFT of the MT images. Series of tilted images were also used\n(Chre´tien et al., 1996) in cases where the separation between JS and JN-S was minimal (e.g. 13_3\nMTs). The monomer spacing along PFs a was determined from the position of the JS layer line in the\nFFT of the MT images (S: monomer helical rise). The theoretical PF skew angle \u0012the on any N_S MT\ncan be calculated using the following formula (Chre´tien and Fuller, 2000):\n\u0012the ¼ tan\u00001\n1\ndx \u0000Sa\nN \u0000 r\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(9)\nThe inter-PF rise r was calculated according to the following formula (Chre´tien and Fuller, 2000):\nr ¼ Sa\nN \u0000dx2\nL\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n1 \u0000dx\nL\n\u0000 \u00012\nq\n(10)\nwhere N denotes the PF number of MTs.\nMicrotubule nucleotide content\nFully GDP-exchanged tubulin was obtained as described before in MEDTA with 3.4 M Glycerol, 0.1\nmM GDP, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 6.7. 40 mM GDP-tubulin in the presence of 0.1 mM GTP or 0.1 mM GTP\nand 50 mm Taxol was incubated at 37˚C for 30 min. MTs were sedimented as above and pellets were\nresuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer. Nucleotide extraction and HPLC separation were then car-\nried out to determine the concentration of each nucleotide as described (Dı´az and Andreu, 1993).\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Ganaderı´a Fernando Dı´az for calf brains supply and staff of beamlines ID23-1 and BM26\n(ESRF, Grenoble, France), BL11-NCD-SWEET and XALOC (ALBA, Cerdanyola del Valle` s, Spain), and\nEste´ vez-Gallego et al. eLife 2020;9:e50155.

The highly conserved membrane-bound rubredoxin-like protein RubA has previously\nbeen implicated in the accumulation of both PSI and PSII, but its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we show that RubA in\nthe cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 is required for photoautotrophic growth in ﬂuctuating light and acts early in\nPSII biogenesis by promoting the formation of the heterodimeric D1/D2 reaction center complex, the site of primary\nphotochemistry. We ﬁnd that RubA, like the accessory factor Ycf48, is a component of the initial D1 assembly module as well\nas larger PSII assembly intermediates and that the redox-responsive rubredoxin-like domain is located on the cytoplasmic\nsurface of PSII complexes. Fusion of RubA to Ycf48 still permits normal PSII assembly, suggesting a spatiotemporal proximity\nof both proteins during their action. RubA is also important for the accumulation of PSI, but this is an indirect effect stemming\nfrom the downregulation of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis induced by PSII deﬁciency. Overall, our data support the\ninvolvement of RubA in the redox control of PSII biogenesis.\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants grow by converting solar energy into chemical energy\nthrough the operation of a photosynthetic electron transport chain\nlocated within the thylakoid membrane system found in chloro-\nplasts. Two large multisubunit pigment-containing reaction\ncenter (RC) complexes, termed PSI and PSII, act in tandem to\nharvest light energy to drive electron ﬂow through a series of\nelectron carriers, ultimately leading to the synthesis of NADPH\nand ATP, which are used for carbon ﬁxation and other key reac-\ntions necessary for plant survival (Flügge et al., 2016).\nPSII is the protein complex of oxygenic photosynthesis that\nextracts electrons from water to release oxygen in one of the most\ndemanding reactions in biology. PSII is found in the prokaryotic\ncyanobacteria as well as chloroplasts and is the most elaborate\ntype of RC found in nature in terms of the number of protein\nsubunits and cofactors (Umena et al., 2011). The biosynthesis of\nPSII has been intensively studied especially in cyanobacteria. The\nprocess involves the stepwise addition of four preassembled\npigment/protein modules (D2mod, D1mod, CP47mod, and CP43mod;\nFigure 1), each containing one large chlorophyll (Chl) binding\nprotein plus one or more neighboring, low-molecular-mass\nsubunits within the PSII complex (Boehm et al., 2011; Komenda\net al., 2012b). Efﬁcient assembly of PSII is facilitated by accessory\nor auxiliary factors that bind to assembly complexes but are not\npresent in the ﬁnal holoenzyme (Komenda et al., 2012b).\nPSII assembly is initiated by the association of D1mod and D2mod\nto form the PSII reaction center (RCII) assembly complex (RCIIa;\nFigure 1). The D1/D2 heterodimer within PSII binds the cofactors\nneeded for light-induced primary charge separation to drive water\noxidation (Diner and Rappaport, 2002). RCIIa consists of D1/D2,\nPsbI, and the PsbE and PsbF subunits of cytochrome (Cyt) b559. In\ncyanobacteria, the association of D1mod with the lumenal Ycf48\naccessory protein promotes the formation of RCIIa (Komenda\net al., 2008). D1mod can further associate with a complex of Ycf39\nand the high-light-inducible proteins (Hlips) that have a photo-\nprotective role during the assembly of RCIIa (Knoppová et al.,\n2014; Staleva et al., 2015). During biogenesis, the Ycf39/Hlips\ncomplex remains associated with RCIIa, forming a larger as-\nsembly complex designated as RCII* (Knoppová et al., 2014).\nAssembly of RCII complexes (either RCII* or RCIIa) is also\n1 Address correspondence to komenda@alga.cz.\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the ﬁnd-\nings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in\nthe Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Josef Komenda\n(komenda@alga.cz).\nwww.plantcell.org/cgi/doi/10.1105/tpc.19.00155\nThe Plant Cell, Vol. 31: 2241–2258, September 2019, www.plantcell.org ã 2019 ASPB.\n\nfacilitated by CyanoP, which binds to the lumenal surface of\nD2mod (Knoppová et al., 2016). Homologs of CyanoP, Ycf48,\nYcf39, and Hlips have been found in land plants (Figure 1; Meurer\net al., 1998; Jansson et al., 2000; Ishihara et al., 2007; Li et al.,\n2019), and so it is thought that the process of PSII assembly\nincluding the early stages of RCII* formation is highly conserved\nin cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (Rühle and Leister, 2016;\nLi et al., 2019).\nRCIIa (or RCII*) subsequently binds CP47mod (Boehm et al.,\n2011) to form the RC47 assembly intermediate (Boehm et al.,\n2012) and then CP43mod to give rise to the monomeric PSII core\ncomplex, RCCII (Boehm et al., 2011). Assembly of PSII is com-\npleted by the light-driven assembly of the Mn4O5Ca oxygen-\nevolving cluster that catalyzes water oxidation, attachment of\nlumenal extrinsic proteins, and dimerization to form the oxygen-\nevolving PSII dimer (Figure 1; Komenda et al., 2012b).\nA number of other proteins have been implicated in the accu-\nmulation of functional PSII complexes, but their roles are currently\nunclear (Rühle and Leister, 2016). One of these is rubredoxin A\n(RubA), which is ubiquitously distributed in all types of oxygenic\nphototrophs (Calderon et al., 2013) and one of only two proteins\npossessing a rubredoxin-like domain within the photosynthetic\nmembranes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Friso et al.,\n2004). RubA consists of a predicted C-terminal transmembrane\nhelix connected via a linker to a soluble, redox-responsive\nrubredoxin-like domain (RD; Wastl et al., 2000; Shen et al.,\n2002b; Calderon et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014). Rubredoxins are\nsmall, soluble proteins that typically contain one iron atom (al-\nthough zinc, cobalt, or nickel can substitute) coordinated to four\ncysteinyl residues (Sieker et al., 1994). RDs are found in various\n(mainly archeal and bacterial) proteins, for instance ﬂavoru-\nbredoxins, ruberythrins, nigerythrins, protein kinase G, or the\nessential LapB protein of Escherichia coli (Gomes et al., 2002; Iyer\net al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2007; Prince and Jia, 2015; Wittwer et al.,\n2016; Prakash et al., 2018), and typically participate in electron\ntransfer reactions or in redox regulation. RubA has been initially\nimplicated in the redox control of the biogenesis of iron-sulfur\n(Fe-S) clusters of PSI in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp\nPCC 7002 (hereafter Synechococcus; Shen et al., 2002a, 2002b;\nGolbeck and Shen, 2006). More recently, the analysis of rubA\nFigure 1. Simpliﬁed Scheme for the Modular Assembly of PSII.\nModules containing the D1 and D2 proteins combine to form the RCII complexes RCIIa and RCII*. They bind the CP47 module followed by the CP43 module\nto obtain a non-oxygen-evolving PSII core complex (RCCII), and ﬁnally, the monomeric and dimeric oxygen-evolving PSII complexes (PSII). Cyanobacterial\naccessory factors associating with the assembly complexes and their plant homologs are indicated in blue and green, respectively. For simplicity, the RCII\ncomplexes (RCIIa and RCII*) as well as PSII dimers and monomers are not distinguished in the scheme.\n2242\nThe Plant Cell\n\nFigure 2. Localization and Topology of RubA in the Isolated Synechocystis Membranes.\n(A) Membrane proteins were separated by blue native (BN) PAGE in the ﬁrst dimension (1D) and further separated by SDS-PAGE in the second\ndimension. The 2D gel was stained with SYPRO Orange (2D SYPRO) and electroblotted, and the indicated proteins were immunodetected using speciﬁc\nantibodies (2D blots). The relative molecular masses in kD are shown on the side of the stained gel and in parentheses next to the names of the im-\nmunodetected proteins. The loaded sample contained 5 mg of Chl.

Despite its vital importance for photo-\nsynthesis, the mechanism of RubA action in PSI and PSII bio-\ngenesis remains unknown.\nIn this study, we have discovered that RubA plays a role at an\nearly stage in PSII biogenesis. We have found that the RubA\nprotein binds to D1mod and that it is required for effective formation\nof the RCII complexes in Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 (hereafter\nSynechocystis) cells. We further show that the low levels of PSI\nseen in a photoautotrophically grown RubA-less mutant is an\nindirect effect of impaired PSII assembly on the light-dependent\nbiosynthesis of Chl. Possible functional roles for RubA are dis-\ncussed in light of our work.\nRESULTS\nRubA Associates with the D1 Assembly Module during the\nBiogenesis of PSII\nThe RubA protein has previously been detected in thylakoid\nmembranes (Shen et al., 2002b; Friso et al., 2004), but its precise\nlocation and function remain unknown. To gain more detailed\ninformation about the presence of RubA in various membrane\ncomplexes, we analyzed membranes isolated from the wild-type\nstrain of Synechocystis using 2D blue native/SDS-PAGE in\ncombination with immunoblotting using speciﬁc antibodies for\nRubA. Although the majority of RubA was detected in the region\nof small complexes and unassembled proteins, small amounts\ncomigrated with the RC47 and RCIIa assembly intermediates of\nPSII (Figure 2A). Trace amounts also comigrated with the mo-\nnomeric PSII core complex [PSII(1)] as well as with the previously\ndetected PSII-PSI supercomplex (Be ˇcková et al., 2017). Nota-\nbly, RubA could not be detected in dimeric PSII [PSII(2)], sug-\ngesting that RubA is not a component of the fully assembled\nactive PSII complex but rather associates with PSII assembly\ncomplexes.\nTo assess whether RubA is present in the RCII* assembly in-\ntermediate, we performed a RubA immunoblot analysis of FLAG-\ntagged Ycf39 complexes pulled down from a mutant lacking the\nCP47 antenna and therefore unable to assemble PSII beyond\nRCII* (Knoppová et al., 2014). The two-dimensional (2D) clear\nnative electrophoresis (CN/SDS-PAGE) and the subsequent im-\nmunoblotanalysisoftheimmunopuriﬁedFLAG-Ycf39preparation\nclearly showed the presence of RubA in RCII* as well as in the\ndissociated RCIIa complex (Figure 2B). Comparing the SYPRO\nstaining intensity of RubA and PsbE suggested a close to\nstoichiometric content of RubA in RCIIa but substoichiometric\ncontent in RCII*, indicating a possible steric constraint between\nRubA and the Ycf39-Hlip complex in RCII*.\nTo determine if RubA binds to D1mod before the formation of\nRCII*, we tested for the presence of RubA in FLAG-tagged Ycf39\ncomplexes pulled down from a D2/CP43-less strain. In the ab-\nsence of D2, the only assembly intermediate that can be coiso-\nlatedwithFLAG-Ycf39isD1mod(Knoppováetal.,2014).Inaddition\nto the previously detected D1, PsbI, and Ycf48 components, the\nRubA protein also copuriﬁed with the FLAG-Ycf39-Hlips-D1mod\ncomplex (Figure 2C). Although the subunits of the puriﬁed com-\nplex partially dissociated during CN/SDS-PAGE, a fraction of\nRubA and D1 comigrated on the 2D gel, suggesting a physical\ninteraction between these two proteins (Figure 2C).\nTo further clarify the interacting partners of RubA, we con-\nstructed a strain expressing an N-terminal FLAG-tagged de-\nrivative of RubA under the control of the psbA2 promoter in the\nDrubA background (Supplemental Table 1). The resulting strain\n(DrubA/psbA2pro:f.rubA) showed photoautotrophic growth and\npigmentation comparable to the wild type, demonstrating that\nFLAG-RubA fulﬁlls the physiological function of RubA\n(Supplemental Figure 1; Supplemental Table 2). The FLAG-RubA\nprotein was isolated under native conditions using an anti-FLAG\nafﬁnity gel. Analysis of the eluate by 2D CN/SDS-PAGE provided\nevidence that FLAG-RubA associates with the RC47 assembly\ncomplex and with the monomeric PSII core complex as well as\nwith the recently described complex of RC47 and monomeric PSI\n(RC47-PSI(1); Figure 3; Be ˇcková et al., 2017). The assembly factor\nPsb27, which is absent from active PSII complexes (Komenda\netal.,2012a),waspresentintheFLAG-RubAeluate,signifyingthat\nthe coisolated monomeric core of PSII did not originate from an\nactive complex (Figure 3). Also, we could not detect any extrinsic\nsubunits associated with oxygen-evolving PSII in the eluate,\nfurther supporting the conclusion that FLAG-RubA speciﬁcally\ninteracts with PSII assembly complexes. Small amounts of\nPSI(1) were also detected in the eluate, but this most probably\noriginated from the disintegration of the RC47-PSI(1) complex,\nas RubA cannot be detected in highly puriﬁed PSI-YFP com-\nplexes isolated using GFP-Trap (Supplemental Figure 2;\nStra\u0001sková et al., 2018).\nThe 2D SDS-PAGE gel demonstrated the speciﬁc binding of the\nFLAG-RubA protein to PSII complexes, as the FLAG-RubA band\ncomigrated with PSII subunits (Figure 3). The speciﬁc presence of\nthe core PSII subunits was also conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry\n(MS) analysis of the FLAG-RubA eluate (Supplemental Table 3).\nUnspeciﬁc binding of the identiﬁed proteins and complexes to the\nFLAG resin was excluded by a control isolation using wild-type\ncells. The resulting control preparation did not contain detectable\nFigure 2. (continued).\n(C) The FLAG-Ycf39 protein was immunopuriﬁed from a strain that lacks the D2 and CP43 subunits of PSII, so the complex assembly is arrested before the\nassociation of D1mod with D2mod. The preparation was analyzed using CN-PAGE in the ﬁrst dimension (1D) and analyzed in the second dimension as\ndescribed for (A). The complexes are designated as in (A) and (B). The asterisk on the blot developed after probing with the antibody against Ycf48 indicates\na cross-reaction with the strong band of Ycf39. U.P., unassembled proteins.\n(D) Trypsinization of membranes for the determination of the RubA membrane topology. Right-side-out membrane vesicles from the strain expressing an\nN-terminally FLAG-tagged RubA (FLAG-RubA) before and after 1 h of trypsinization were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the gel was electroblotted, and FLAG-\nRubA as well as PsbO were detected using speciﬁc antibodies. Each loaded sample contained 3 mg of Chl.\n2244\nThe Plant Cell\n\namounts of PSII complexes and only trace amounts of trimeric PSI\n(Supplemental Figure 3). Overall, these biochemical data demon-\nstrate that RubA can engage with D1mod before the formation of RCII\ncomplexes but can also be found in later PSII assembly\nintermediates.\nRubA Is Exposed on the Cytoplasmic Side of the Membrane\nCurrent structural models suggest that RubA consists of an\nN-terminal RD attached to a potential transmembrane a-helix via\na 26-amino-acid-long ﬂexible hinge (Wastl et al., 2000). To de-\ntermine whether the N-terminal RD is orientated toward the\nlumenal or the cytoplasmic site of the membrane, we isolated\nright-side-outvesiclesfromthestrainexpressingFLAG-RubAand\nsubsequently treated the vesicles with trypsin (Komenda, 2000).\nAfter 1 h of trypsinization, the control and treated samples were\nanalyzed by immunoblot using FLAG-speciﬁc antibodies. We\nfound that the vast majority of the FLAG signal disappeared after\ntrypsinization (Figure 2D). Since RubA is FLAG-tagged at its N\nterminus, these data would place RD on the cytoplasmic side of\nthe thylakoid membrane, as previously proposed (Wastl et al.,\n2000). By contrast, the lumenal PSII subunit PsbO (Umena et al.,\n2011) was protected from trypsin digestion, conﬁrming the in-\ntegrity of the right-side-out vesicles (Figure 2D).\nRubA Is Required for the Accumulation of\nBoth Photosystems\nTo clarify the physiological function of RubA, we constructed\na Synechocystis rubA deletion mutant. The DrubA strain exhibited\nstrongly impaired photoautotrophic growth in liquid cultures at\nstandard illumination (40 mmol photons m22 s21), and the elimi-\nnation of the rubA gene was lethal under alternating 15-min\nstandard light/15-min dark conditions (Figure 4A). Furthermore,\nwhen wild-type and DrubA cells were exposed to high irradiance,\nthe variable Chl ﬂuorescence reﬂecting PSII function declined\nsubstantially faster in the mutant when compared with the wild\ntype, indicating a high sensitivity of mutant cells to photoinhibition\n(Figure 4B).\nThe in vivo absorption spectra of the DrubA mutant showed\nastrongdepletionofChlasjudgedfromthelowabsorptionpeakat\n;679 nm, which reﬂects reduced accumulation of Chl binding\nphotosynthetic complexes, particularly PSI (Figure 5A). We iso-\nlated wild-type and mutant membranes and separated their\ncomplexes by CN-PAGE; and indeed, the color scan of the gel\nconﬁrmed markedly lower amounts of trimeric and monomeric\nPSI [PSI(3)] and to a lesser degree PSI(1) in the DrubA strain com-\npared with the wild type (Figure 5C, color). Moreover, substantially\nlower amounts of PSII(1) as well as dimeric PSII(2) were detected\nby Chl ﬂuorescence in the membranes of DrubA (Figure 5C, ﬂuo).\nClose Relationship between the RubA and Ycf48\nAccessory Factors\nIn every known cyanobacterial genome, the rubA gene is up-\nstream of the gene encoding Ycf48. Moreover, in Synechocystis,\nthese two genes were shown to form one transcriptional unit (Kopf\net al., 2014). In line with the transcriptomic data, we found that\ninsertionofanantibioticcassetteintothecodingregionoftherubA\ngene led to a substantial decrease in the intracellular levels of\nYcf48 (Figure 5B). To ensure that the low amounts of the pho-\ntosystems in DrubA are not a consequence of the decreased\naccumulation of Ycf48, which is known to play a role in the as-\nsembly ofPSII(Yuetal., 2018),we expressedanadditional copy of\nFigure 3. Protein Interacting Partners of RubA.\nThe FLAG-RubA preparation was analyzed by CN-PAGE in the ﬁrst di-\nmension. The native gel was photographed (1D color) and scanned for Chl\nﬂuorescence (1D ﬂuo), and proteins were separated in the second di-\nmension as described for Figure 2A. Designation of complexes is as in\nFigure 2A; f.RubA, FLAG-RubA; PSI(1)-RC47 is a complex containing\nmonomeric PSI and RC47.

The resulting DrubA/\npsbA2pro:ycf48 strain contained an even higher amount of Ycf48\nthan the wild type (Figure 5B). Nevertheless, the accumulation of\nPSII and PSI (Figure 5C) as well as photoautotrophic growth and\npigmentation were not improved (Figure 5A; Supplemental Ta-\nble 2). However, photoautotrophy of DrubA could be restored by\nexpressing an extra copy of rubA, indicating that the phenotype of\nthis mutant is speciﬁcally related to the absence of RubA, as\nthe Ycf48 level remained low in the complemented DrubA/\npsbA2pro:rubA strain (Figures 5A to 5C; Supplemental Table 2;\nCalderon et al., 2013). Furthermore, deleting the ycf48 gene from\nDrubA did not change the growth and pigmentation of the strain\n(Figures 5A and 5C; Supplemental Table 2). Overall, these results\nconﬁrm that RubA is important for photosystem accumulation\nandthattheobserved phenotypeofDrubAisnot duetodecreased\nYcf48 expression in the mutant.\nThe coupled expression of the genes coding for RubA and\nYcf48 as well as the association of both of these proteins with\nD1mod during PSII biogenesis (Figure 2C) raised the possibility\nthat they might act in concert and that perhaps they might once\nhave functioned as a single protein. To test this, we constructed\nstrain rubA-ycf48 that expressed RubA and Ycf48 as a fused\nprotein (RubA-Ycf48; for the primary structure, see Figure 5D).\nThe RubA-Ycf48 protein was detected in membranes using\nspeciﬁc antibodies against both Ycf48 and RubA and had the\nexpected predicted molecular mass (Figure 5B). Under stan-\ndard growth conditions, the rubA-ycf48 strain contained\nsomewhat lower amounts of PSII dimers than the wild type\n(Figure 5C), but otherwise its photoautotrophic growth and\npigmentation were comparable to the wild type (Supplemental\nTable 2). Moreover, unlike DrubA, which could not proliferate on\nplates exposed to 30 mmol photons m22 s21, the rubA-ycf48\nfusion strain could grow well even at 300 mmol photons m22 s21\n(Figure 5E), which is an irradiance that is lethal for the single\nDycf48 mutant (Yu et al., 2018). Overall, these data indicate\nthat the RubA-Ycf48 fusion protein fulﬁlls the physiological\nfunctions of RubA and Ycf48 almost as well as the individual\nproteins.\nRubA Is Speciﬁcally Needed for the Formation of the\nRCII Complex\nTo gain detailed information about the synthesis and accumula-\ntion of the photosystems and their subunits, photoautotrophically\ngrown cells of DrubA and the wild type were radioactively labeled\nwith a mixture of [35S]Met/Cys. The membranes isolated from\nthese cells were analyzed by 2D CN/SDS-PAGE, and the gel was\nstained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), dried, and subjected to\nautoradiography. The CN gel and the stained 2D SDS-PAGE gel\nconﬁrmed thelow levelsof PSIandPSII andrevealedanexcessive\namount of unassembled CP43 in the mutant (Figure 6). The ac-\ncumulation of this unassembled internal antenna suggests that\nthe mutant membranes lack the RC47 assembly intermediate that\nbinds CP43mod (Knoppová et al., 2014).\nImportantly, combining the 2D gel with radiography revealed\nprominent differences in the distribution of newly synthesized D1\nand D2 subunits in the wild-type and DrubA membranes. After\na 30-min pulse, the majority of labeled D1 and D2 was assembled\ninto monomeric and dimeric PSII complexes in the wild type, and\nminor amounts were as well detected in the RCII* and RCIIa\ncomplexes (Figure 6). In addition, small amounts of the three\ndifferent forms of D1 (precursor D1 containing the C-terminal\nextension, a partially cleaved D1 intermediate, and mature D1)\ncould be detected in the unassembled protein fraction of the wild\ntype (Komenda et al., 2004).\nIn the DrubA strain, the D1 and D2 subunits as well as the\nCP47 and CP43 antennae were synthesized at close to wild-type\nlevels (Figure 6, 2D autorads). However, in striking contrast to\nthe wild type, the vast majority of labeled D1 and D2 remained\nin the unassembled protein fraction, consistent with a block in\nthe formation of RCII complexes. Given that unassembled D1 and\nFigure 4.

This phase is strongly inﬂuenced by the\nredox state of the PQ pool; therefore, its higher contribution to the\ndecay kinetics might be explained by an enhanced accumulation\nof reduced PQ molecules (Deák et al., 2014). Finally, the slow\nphase (half-time of ;1–20 s), which reﬂects charge recombination\nbetween QA\n2/QB\n2 and the S2 state of the water-oxidizing complex,\nwas comparable in the mutant and the wild type. The similarity in\ncharge recombination between the wild type and DrubA was\nconﬁrmed by the identical relaxation kinetics of ﬂash-induced\nﬂuorescence monitored in the presence of DCMU that blocks\nelectron transfer between QA and QB. Thus, we conclude\nthat there are no substantial changes in the redox gaps within\nthe PSII complex of the mutant, indicating that the assembled\ncomplexes are functionally intact and that the low PSII activity is\nthe consequence of low PSII accumulation in the mutant cells\n(Figure 7; Table 1).\nChl Biosynthesis Is Inhibited in the Photoautotrophically\nGrown DrubA Mutant\nAlthoughtheaccumulationofbothphotosystemsisreducedinthe\nDrubA strain, we could detect an association of RubA only with\nPSII andnot withPSI(Figures 2and 3;Supplemental Figure 2).The\nmutant was especially deﬁcient in the content of trimeric PSI,\nwhereas the monomeric PSI form was clearly less affected\nFigure 6. 2D Analysis of Radioactively Labeled Membrane Proteins of the Wild Type and DrubA.\nMembranes isolated fromradioactivelylabeled cells wereanalyzed by CN-PAGE intheﬁrstdimension(1D color and1D ﬂuo).

Such a preferential decrease in trimeric PSI has been\npreviously observed in Synechocystis mutants with impaired Chl\nbiosynthesis (Kope ˇcná et al., 2013, 2015b).\nCertain enzymatic steps in Chl biosynthesis need either plas-\ntoquinol, NADP(H), ATP, or oxygen (Willows, 2006; Steccanella\net al., 2015). The production of these substances is dependent on\nPSII activity; therefore, we tested the potential effect of low PSII\nactivity on Chl biosynthesis in wild-type cells. For this purpose, we\ngrew the wild type autotrophically in the presence of 0.8 mM DCMU\nwhich suppressed oxygen-evolving PSII activity to a similar level to\nthatfoundinDrubA (Table1). Unlike inDrubA, PSII biogenesis inthe\nDCMU-treated wild-type cells remained intact; assembly inter-\nmediates were converted into PSII(1) and PSII(2), and the accu-\nmulation of the PSII complexes was comparable to what was\nobserved in the untreated wild-type cells (Supplemental Figures 4A\nand4C).ThereductioninPSIIactivityinbothDrubAandtheDCMU-\ntreated wild-type cells led to similar low ATP levels and resulted in\na reduced Chl content in comparison with the control wild-type\ncells. The lower Chl content was directly proportional to the\nreduction in the total amount of photooxidizable P700 (Pm), which\nreﬂects the number of active PSI complexes in the cell (Table 1).\nThe DrubA mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus has\npreviously been reported to lack PSI-mediated electron transport\nactivity due to the loss of the iron-sulfur clusters from the complex\nand their associated stromal subunits (Shen et al., 2002b).\nTherefore, we addressed whether the decreased Pm value in the\nSynechocystis DrubA mutant could be inﬂuenced by changes in\nthe functional integrity of the complex. Using size-exclusion\nchromatography, we isolated fractions highly enriched in PSI(3)\nfrom detergent-solubilized membrane extracts of the Synecho-\ncystis wild-type and DrubA strains. SDS-PAGE and subsequent\nimmunoblot analysis of the fractions indicated that the subunit\ncomposition of the PSI complexes isolated from the wild type and\nmutant was comparable (Figures 8A and 8B). Additionally, the rate\nof PSI-mediated electron transport in the isolated PSI-enriched\nmembranes did not show signiﬁcant differences (P 5 0.197;\nFigure 8C). These data demonstrated that the low amount of\nP7001 in the DrubA mutant of Synechocystis is solely due to the\nreducednumber of PSIcomplexes andthatthe functional integrity\nof the PSI complexes remained intact.\nTo estimate the effect of the low PSII activities on Chl bio-\nsynthesis, we assessed the relative abundances of particular\nenzymes as well as biosynthetic intermediates of the pathway. We\nfound that the level of the catalytic H subunit of magnesium\nchelatase (MgCh), the enzyme responsible for the production of\nMg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-PPIX), was lower in DrubA as well as in\nDCMU-treated wild-type cells when compared with the control\nwild-type cells (Figure 9A). By contrast, the level of ferrochelatase\n(FeCh), the enzyme synthesizing heme and competing for the\nsame substrate as MgCh, was relatively high in the mutant and in\nthe DCMU-treated wild type. The reduced ratio of MgCh to FeCh\nsuggests thatChl production wassuppressed bychanneling PPIX\nFigure 7.

This conclusion was supported by the\nrelatively low Chl but higher heme content in DrubA and DCMU-\ntreated wild-type cells compared with the control wild-type cells\n(Table 1). In addition, we detected a lower level of Mg-\nprotoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (MgPME) oxidative cyclase\n(cyclase) in DCMU-treated wild-type cells and overaccumulation\nof Chl synthase in the DrubA cells. HPLC analysis of pigments\nshowed similarly low abundances of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic\nintermediates in the DrubA and DCMU-treated wild-type cells\n(Figure 9B). Namely, the early precursor coproporphyrinogen III\n(CoPP) was hardly detectable, and the PPIX content was also\nsubstantially lower in DrubA and DCMU-treated wild-type cells in\ncomparison with the control wild-type cells. These data indicate\nthatlowPSII activityledtothe downregulation ofChlproduction at\nan early stage in biosynthesis and this resulted in decreased\naccumulation of PSI complexes (Table 1; Supplemental Figure 4).\nChl Biosynthesis Is Restored in the DrubA Mutant in\nthe Dark\nSynechocystis is a facultative photoautotroph that is able to\nproliferate in the dark by light-activated heterotrophic growth\n(LAHG). During LAHG, Synechocystis cells do not photosynthe-\nsize and instead drive their metabolism by energy and reductants\nderived solely from a carbohydrate supplement (Anderson and\nMcIntosh, 1991). To verify that downregulated Chl biosynthesis\nand the consequent reduction in PSI accumulation are results of\nthe low intracellular PSII activity, we grew the wild type and DrubA\nunder LAHG conditions. We found that unlike during photo-\nautotrophy, under LAHG conditions the in vivo absorption spectra\nof the wild-type and DrubA cells were very similar (Figure 10A).\nNevertheless, CN-PAGE separation of the membrane complexes\nrevealed that the accumulation of PSII remained impaired in the\nmutant, while the amount of the PSI complexes reached the wild-\ntype control level (Figure 10B). The relative amounts of PSII and\nPSI in photoautotrophic and LAHG cultures of the wild type and\nDrubA were addressed by low-temperature Chl ﬂuorescence\nspectroscopy on an equal cell basis. After excitation of Chl at 435\nnm, the photoautotrophic DrubA cells exhibited remarkably lower\nﬂuorescence emission bands at 695 and 725 nm in comparison\nwith the photoautotrophic wild-type cells (Figure 10C). This re-\nﬂects lower amounts of active PSII and PSI complexes, re-\nspectively (Shen and Vermaas, 1994). The other PSII-related\nﬂuorescence peak at 685 nm was relatively high in the mutant and\nis likely to reﬂect the ﬂuorescence emission from the CP43 an-\ntenna (Shen and Vermaas, 1994) that accumulates within the\nmutant (Figure 6). In the LAHG cells of DrubA, the PSII ﬂuores-\ncence peak at 695 nm remained relatively low. By contrast, the\n725-nm ﬂuorescence peak reﬂecting the PSI content was now\ncomparable tothatinLAHG cellsofthewild type.Likewise, theChl\ncontent of the mutant reached wild-type levels under LAHG\nconditions (Figure 10D). Moreover, the levels of the tetrapyrrole\nprecursors reﬂecting the rate of Chl biosynthesis were similar in\nFigure 8.

We show here that the complexes that do\naccumulate (15%–20% of wild-type level) are functionally intact\n(Figure 7). These data indicate that RubA is involved in the ac-\ncumulation but not the function of the oxygen-evolving PSII\ncomplex, in line with the absence of RubA from fully assembled\nPSII(2) complexes (Figure 2A).\nA role for RubA in the assembly of PSII was clariﬁed in pulse-\nlabeling experiments that revealed a bottleneck in the formation of\nthe RCII complex (Figure 6), previously shown to contain the D1/\nD2 heterodimer, Cyt b559, PsbI, and the Ycf48 accessory factor\n(Komenda et al., 2008). Pull-down experiments showed that RubA\nwas present in the D1mod that combines with the D2mod to form\nRCII, and so RubA plays a role early in PSII assembly (Figures 2B\nand 2C). In contrast to the wild type, the RubA deletion strain\nshowed a similar defect in PSII accumulation in the dark as well as\nin the light (Figures 5 and 10). These data therefore suggest that\nRubA plays an important role in the early stages of PSII assembly\n(Figure 11) even in the absence of photoinhibitory damage.\nAn additional role for RubA in protecting PSII assembly inter-\nmediates from photodamage is also possible given its presence in\nlarger assembly complexes [RC47 and PSII(1); Figures 2 and 3]\nthat are inactive for oxygen evolution and prone to photoinhibition\n(Komenda et al., 2010). Given that RubA is attached to D1mod\ncontaining the D1 subunit (Figure 2C), a role of RubA in replacing\nD1 during the repair of photodamaged PSII should also be con-\nsidered.Boththesefeaturesmightexplainthegreatersensitivityof\nPSII in the DrubA strain to photoinhibition (Figure 4B).\nThe requirement of RubA for efﬁcient formation of the D1/D2\nheterodimer that holds all the redox-active components essential\nfor PSII primary photochemistry (Diner and Rappaport, 2002) is\nrather intriguing. RubA possesses an RD that is known to par-\nticipate in electron transfer reactions or redox regulation. There-\nfore, RubA might function to maintain PSII assembly complexes in\nan appropriate redox state during biogenesis to prevent light-\ninduced irreversible damage and/or promote the insertion of the\nredox-active non-heme iron bound at the interface between D1\nand D2. The other redox-active cofactor that is inserted during\nbiogenesis and is located on the same cytoplasmic side of PSII as\nRD (Figure 2D; Wastl et al., 2000) is QA, the primary plastoquinone\nelectron acceptor in PSII. The midpoint redox potential of RubA is\n1125 mV (Wastl et al., 2000), which is positive enough to allow\nRubAto keeptheacceptor sideofPSII oxidizedandsoprevent the\naccumulation of singly reduced QA (due to either inadvertent\nnonphotochemical reduction or lack of functional QB). Another\npossibility is that reduced RubA might reduce Cyt b559 within PSII\nand so act as part of a photoprotective cyclic electron transport\npathway involving the oxidation and subsequent rereduction of\nP6801 via a pathway involving QA, RubA, Cyt b559, and the CarD2\ncarotenoid bound to D2 (Shinopoulos et al., 2014). A redox role for\nRubA is supported by our observation that the DrubA strain is able\nto proliferate in autotrophic media under continuous illumination\nbut not when exposed to ﬂuctuating light consisting of cycles of\nFigure 9.

So, the activity of RubA itself might be under redox control\nand a checkpoint for redox-regulated PSII assembly.\nIn all cyanobacteria, the rubA gene is transcribed together with\nthe gene encoding Ycf48, which is a b-propeller protein located on\nthe lumenal side of the membrane (Yu et al., 2018) and also is in-\nvolvedinpromotingtheformationofPSIIRC(Komendaetal.,2008).\nRubA seems to play a more dominant role than Ycf48 in PSII as-\nsembly, as the phenotype of DrubA is more severe than that of the\nDycf48mutantanditwasnotalteredbytheoverexpressionofYcf48\n(Figures 5A and 5C). Consistent with this, the DrubA/Dycf48 double\nmutant has a similar phenotype to the DrubA single mutant. Nev-\nertheless, a possible interplay between the action of RubA and\nYcf48 is suggested by the effective complementation of the DrubA/\nDycf48 mutant by the expression of a RubA-Ycf48 fusion protein in\nwhich the N terminus of Ycf48 is fused to the C terminus of RubA\n(Figures5Dand5E).Additionally,bothYcf48andRubAaredetected\nin the RCII and RC47 assembly complexes (Figure 2A), and Ycf48\nwas detected in the pull-down assay using FLAG-tagged RubA as\na bait (Figure 3). Based on these data, we speculate that Ycf48 and\nRubA might once have functioned as a single protein during PSII\nassembly and that in extant organisms Ycf48 still attaches to PSII in\nthe lumen close to the C terminus of RubA (Figure 11).\nEarlier studies showed that the rubA deletion mutant of Syn-\nechococcus was not able to grow photoautotrophically, andwhen\ngrown using a carbohydrate supplement, PSII activity decreased\nto 77% of the wild-type levels (Shen et al., 2002b). No PSI activity\nwas detected in the mutant, because of the loss of the Fe-S\nclusters of PSI and their associated stromal subunits (Shen\net al., 2002a, 2002b). In Synechococcus, RubA is suspected to\nkeep the strong reductant A1 oxidized during PSI biogenesis, so\nthat A1\n2 will not reduce the Fe-S cluster, which can then be in-\nserted into the complex (Golbeck and Shen, 2006). However,\nFigure 10.

The\ncolumns and error bars represent means 6 SE, respectively, for at least three independent cultures.\n2252\nThe Plant Cell\n\nunlike in higher plants and in the rest of cyanobacteria (including\nSynechocystis), where the PSI secondary electron acceptor A1 is\na phylloquinone molecule, in Synechococcus, A1 is menaquinone,\nwhich is typical for bacterial type I reaction centers (Sakuragi\net al., 2005). It is possible that the presence of different quinones\nin the proximity of the Fe-S clusters allows alternative ways of\nregulating the biogenesis of the complex. Nevertheless, our data\nshow that, in contrast to Synechococcus, the absence of RubA\nin Synechocystis does not affect the subunit composition and\nthe functional integrity of PSI (Figure 8).\nNewly synthesized Chl has been previously shown to be\npreferentially channeled to trimeric PSI; therefore, accumulation\nof this complex is reliant on functional Chl biosynthesis\n(Kope ˇcná et al., 2012). When PSII complexes in the wild type were\ninhibited by DCMU to give the same low activity displayed by\nDrubA (Table 1), the Chl biosynthetic pathway was similarly in-\nhibited in both strains (Figure 9B). One possible step in Chl bio-\nsynthesisthatcouldberegulatedbyPSIIactivityisthesynthesisof\nMg-PPIX catalyzed by MgCh. This enzyme consists of four\nsubunits—the catalytic H subunit works together in a complex\nwithGun4andtheChlIandChlDsubunits—andhydrolyzesATPto\ndrive the thermodynamically unfavorable insertion of Mg into PPIX\n(Adams et al., 2016). Therefore, it is likely that the reduced ATP\ncontent in cells with low PSII activity (Table 1) results in the feeble\naccumulation of Mg-PPIX, the ﬁrst committed precursor of Chl\n(Figure 9B). Impaired production of Mg-PPIX was shown to\ndownregulate the initial steps of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic\npathway (Hedtke et al., 2007; Kope ˇcná et al., 2015a), which may\nexplain the low levels of all precursors needed for Chl synthesis\n(Figure 9B). By contrast, the level of FeCh, the enzyme that\ncompetes for the same substrate as MgCh, was upregulated in\nDrubA (Figure 9A). FeCh is a key regulatory enzyme of the tet-\nrapyrrole pathway in cyanobacteria as well as in plants (Sobotka\net al., 2005, 2008; Woodson et al., 2011; Scharfenberg et al.,\n2015), and its elevated level in PSII mutants has been reported\nearlier (Sobotka et al., 2005). A combination of high FeCh and\nlow MgCh activity could redirect most of the available PPIX into\nthe heme branch away from Chl production. Furthermore,\nby a feedback loop, the increased amount of heme can inhibit\nthe synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid, the ﬁrst committed\nprecursor of tetrapyrroles (Czarnecki and Grimm, 2012), further\nrestricting the PPIX ﬂow into the Chl biosynthetic pathway. How\nFeCh is connected to PSII is not known and needs further\ninvestigation.\nDespite the comparable levels of Chl biosynthetic precursors\nin DrubA and in DCMU-treated wild-type cells, the latter still con-\ntains more Chl and more PSI complexes (Table 1; Supplemental\nFigure 4). We have previously shown that deletion of the PSII\nsubunit CP47 also leads to PSI depletion, which is more extensive\nthan in strains withinactivated PSII that are still able to accumulate\nCP47-containing PSII complexes (Be ˇcková et al., 2017). These\ndatasuggestthatthe presenceofRC47isnecessaryforfunctional\nChl biosynthesis in the light, and consequently, for the accu-\nmulation of PSI trimers. However, here we show that Chl bio-\nsynthesis, as well as PSI accumulation, was much more similar in\nthewildtypeandthePSII-deﬁcientDrubAstrainsgrowninthedark\n(Figure 10). These data indicate that assembled PSII complexes\nare not needed for Chl biosynthesis in the dark, which involves\na different set of enzymes. In the dark, the light-independent\nprotochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR), an enzyme pro-\nducing chlorophyllide (Chlide), must replace its light-dependent\nversion (Fang et al., 2017). This switch is particularly important\nunder LAHG conditions(Kope ˇcná etal., 2013), whenthe dissolved\noxygen concentration issubstantiallylowerandsomorefavorable\nfor the nitrogenase-like, oxygen-sensitive DPOR (Yamazaki et al.,\n2006). Under such conditions, the oxygen-dependent cyclase\nenzyme preceding (D)POR is also downregulated and most\nprobably partially replaced by the anoxygenic “bacterial-type”\ncyclase (BchE; Hasunuma et al., 2018). Indeed, the strong ac-\ncumulation of both MgPME and protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), the\nsubstrates of cyclase and DPOR, was observed in the LAHG cells,\nimplying a decline in the cyclase and POR activities (Figure 10D).\nFurthermore, the oxygen-dependent CoPP oxidase (HemF)\nresponsible for the decarboxylation of CoPP is likely to be\nsubstituted by the oxygen-independent HemN under LAHG (Goto\net al., 2010). These enzymes are structurally different from their\n“light” counterparts: they use different cofactors and electron\ndonors/acceptors that might explain why in the dark Chl bio-\nsynthesis is not connected to PSII activity.\nIn summary, we have shown that RubA binds to D1mod during\nPSII assembly and plays a physiologically important role in the\naccumulation of the PSII reaction center assembly complex. The\naccumulation of PSI was also defective in the DrubA strain, but\na speciﬁc interaction between RubA and PSI could not be con-\nﬁrmed (Supplemental Figure 2). Instead, we showed that the\nreduced PSI level is an indirect effect of low PSII activity on the\nlight-dependent pathway of Chl biosynthesis needed for PSI\naccumulation. Thus, we conclude that the unique and ubiquitous\npresence of the rubA gene in all sequenced oxygenic phototrophs\nreﬂects the essential and universal role of RubA in the formation of\nthe oxygen-evolving PSII complex.\nFigure 11. Model for the Early Stages of PSII Assembly Showing the\nLocations of RubA and the Other Cyanobacterial/Plant Accessory\nProteins.\nYcf48 (HCF136 in plants) and the chlorophyll-containing Ycf39/Hlip\ncomplex (HCF244/OHP in plants) assist in the insertion of Chl into D1mod,\nwhile CyanoP (PPL1 in plants) stabilizes D2mod. The transmembrane do-\nmain of RubA associates with the N-terminal region of D1, positioning the\nC-terminal tail of RubA in close proximity to the lumenal Ycf48 factor. The\nlinker region of RubA allows the rubredoxin domain to bind at the interface\nof D1 and D2. All factors remain associated with the modules after they\nform the RCII* complex.\nRole of RubA in Photosystem Biogenesis\n2253\n\nMETHODS\nConstruction and Cultivation of Strains\nThe Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 glucose-tolerant substrain GT-P was\nused as the wild type (Tichý et al., 2016). The DrubA strain was constructed\nby replacing the slr2033 gene (36–339 bp) by a zeocin antibiotic resistance\ncassette. The sequences upstream and downstream (350 bp) of the rubA\ngene were ampliﬁed using two sets of primers (Supplemental Table 4), and\nfusion PCR in conjunction with megaprimers (Ke and Madison, 1997) were\nused to anneal these on either side of the zeocin resistance cassette. The\nresulting PCR product was transformed into the GT-P Synechocystis\nsubstrain, and the transformed cells were fully segregated on BG-11 plates\nwith increasing concentrations of zeocin. The Synechocystis strain\nexpressing the RubA protein fused with 3xFLAG at the N terminus (FLAG-\nRubA) was prepared using the pPD-NFLAG plasmid essentially as de-\nscribed (Hollingshead et al., 2012). To construct the DrubA/Dycf48 mutant,\ntheDrubAstrainwastransformedwithchromosomalDNAisolatedfromthe\nycf48 disruption mutant (Komenda et al., 2008), and the transformed cells\nwere fully segregated on increasing concentrations of chloramphenicol.\nThe construction of DrubA/psbA2pro:rubA and DrubA/psbA2pro:ycf48 was\nperformed by cloning rubA or ycf48, respectively, into the DrubA strain\nusing the pPD-NFLAG plasmid. The in-frame fusion of the rubA and ycf48\ngenes was constructed by deleting the nucleotides between the codons\nspecifying Gly-115 of RubA and Cys-29 of Ycf48 (Figure 5D) using inverse\nPCR (for primers, see Supplemental Table 4) and the template vector\npYcf48WTgen (Yu et al., 2018). The religated PCR fragment was then\ncloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced prior to transformation of the\nSynechocystis mutant Dycf48 (Yu et al., 2018) to yield the rubA-ycf48 strain.\nUnless stated otherwise, the Synechocystis strains were grown pho-\ntoautotrophically in liquid BG-11 medium on a rotary shaker at 28°C under\na moderate irradiance of 40 mmol photons m22 s21 given by white ﬂuo-\nrescence tubes (standard light). The spectrum of the cultivation light\n(Supplemental Figure 5) was measured with a Spectrapen SP 110 spec-\ntrophotometer(PSI).Theﬂuctuatinglight/darkconditionswereachievedby\nalternating 15 min of standard light with 15-min dark intervals. The LAHG\ncultures were grown for 6 d in BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mM\nglucose in darkness with 5-min daily illumination of standard light\n(Anderson and McIntosh, 1991). To mimic the low PSII activity measured in\nthe DrubA mutant, a partial loss of PSII activity in the wild-type cells was\nartiﬁcially induced by the addition of 0.8 mM DCMU (Metz et al., 1986) to the\ngrowth medium. The DCMU-treated wild-type cell cultures were twice\nreinoculated to fresh DCMU-containing media and were harvested for\ncharacterization after 2 weeks of cultivation.\nThe absorption spectra of cells were measured by a UV-3000 spec-\ntrophotometer (Shimadzu). The number of cells was assessed by a Mul-\ntisizer 4 (Beckman Coulter). For the determination of doubling times, ﬁve\nindependent cultures of each strain were cultivated.\nAssessment of Photosystem Activities and Integrities\nThe number of active PSII in the cell was assessed by measuring the\noxygen evolution rate of the complexes in the presence of the artiﬁcial\nelectron acceptors 0.5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 mM 2,5-dimethyl-\np-benzoquinone (Sigma-Aldrich). The rates of oxygen evolution and\nconsumption were measured using a Clark-type electrode. Variable\nﬂuorescence during high-light (300 mmol photons m22 s21) exposure was\nfollowed using an Aquapen-100 (PSI) after 5 min of dark incubation.\nPSII electron transport kinetics were followed by the emission and\nsubsequent relaxation kinetics of ﬂash-induced Chl ﬂuorescence in the\nabsence or presence of 10 mM DCMU using a double-modulation ﬂuo-\nrometer (PSI) as described (Vass et al., 1999).\nThe Pm to determine the amount of active PSI complexes was in-\nduced by a saturating pulse followed by a recovery period in the\ndark (Klughammer, 2008). Before the measurement, 1 mM 2,6-\ndichlorophenolindophenol, 10 mM L-ascorbate, and 1 mM methyl viol-\nogen (Sigma-Aldrich) were added as artiﬁcial electron donors and\nacceptor, respectively; 10 mM DCMU (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to ex-\nclude PSII-driven electron ﬂow.\nFor the PSI and PSII assays with intact cells, ﬁve independent cultures\nwere used.\nThe Chl ﬂuorescence spectra was recorded at 77 K on equal amounts\n(108) of cells that were washed into fresh BG-11 medium, mixed with 2 nM\nrhodamine (Sigma-Aldrich), transferred into a sample holder, and frozen in\nliquid nitrogen. The frozen sample was excited at 435 nm, and the ﬂuo-\nrescence emission was recorded between 550 and 800 nm by an Aminco\nBowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Unicam). The\nassay was repeated on three independent cultures of each strain.\nTo assess the activity of isolated PSI, equal amounts of cellular\nmembranes(normalizedtoChlcontent)wereisolatedinMESbuffer(25mM\nMES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM CaCl2) and solubilized\nby n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside (DDM; DDM/Chl 5 20 [w/w]). The unsolu-\nbilized membranes were removed by Corning Costar Spin-X centrifuge\ntubeﬁlters(Sigma-Aldrich),andthesolubilized membranecomplexeswere\nseparated by a Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) size-exclusion column (Amer-\nshamPharmaciaBiotech)usingMESbuffercontaining0.06%(w/v)DDMat\na ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min. The minute fraction containing PSI(3) was collected\nand analyzed by protein immunoblot assay to determine the subunit\ncomposition of the PSI complexes. The electron transport rates mediated\nby PSI was measured by means of oxygen consumption in the presence\nof 1.5 mM L-ascorbate, 0.2 mM 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as electron\ndonor, and 0.1 mM methyl viologen as electron acceptor. Ten micromolar\nDCMU was added to the sample to eliminate the effects of potential PSII\ncontamination. Each isolate was measured ﬁve times. Since the wild-type\ndata set gave a slightly higher average value than the mutant within the\nrange of SD, we tested the signiﬁcance of this difference using a one-tailed t\ntest, with a signiﬁcance level set to P < 0.05. The obtained t and P values\nwere 0.9175 and 0.197, respectively.\nPreparation of Cellular Membranes and Their Trypsinization\nCells from exponential growth phase (5 3 109) were pelleted, washed,\nand resuspended in buffer B (25 mM MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mM CaCl2,\n10 mM MgCl2, and 25% (v/v) glycerol). They were broken mechanically\nin a Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec) using balotina beads as described\n(Komenda and Barber, 1995). The membrane and soluble protein\nfractions were separated by centrifugation at high speed (65,000g,\n20 min). The pelleted membranes were washed and resuspended in\nbuffer B. The trypsinization of isolated membranes was performed as\ndescribed (Dobáková et al., 2009).\nIsolation of Protein Complexes\nForthepuriﬁcationofproteincomplexesundernativeconditions,cellsfrom\n4-liter cultures (OD at 750 nm of ;0.5) were centrifuged, washed, and\nbroken as described above. The cellular membranes containing 1 mg/mL\nChl were solubilized for 1 h with 1% (w/v) DDM at 10°C and centrifuged for\n20 min at 65,000g to remove insolubilized membrane particles. The su-\npernatant was loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2 afﬁnity gel chromatography\ncolumn (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins bound to the column were washed six\ntimes with 2.5 resin volumes of buffer B containing 0.04% (w/v) DDM.\nFLAG-tagged protein complexes were eventually eluted with buffer B\ncontaining 0.04% (w/v) DDM and 150 mg/mL 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma-\nAldrich).\nThe immunoprecipitation using green ﬂuorescent protein-Trap\n(ChromoTek) was performed as described (Stra\u0001sková et al., 2018).\n2254\nThe Plant Cell\n\nProtein Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Radiolabeling\nFor native electrophoresis, solubilized membrane proteins or isolated\ncomplexes were separated on 4 to 12% (w/v) CN (Wittig et al., 2007) or blue\nnative(SchäggerandvonJagow,1991)gelsintheﬁrstdimension.Theprotein\ngels were scanned andthe Chl ﬂuorescence image was taken bya LAS 4000\ncamera (Fuji). The individual components of the protein complexes were\nresolved by incubating the gel strip from the ﬁrst dimension in 62.5 mM Tris/\nHCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 1% (w/v) DTT for 30 min at room\ntemperature, and by subsequent separation in the second dimension by\nSDS-electrophoresis on a denaturing 12 to 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel\ncontaining 7 M urea (Dobáková et al., 2009). For standard single-dimension\nSDS-PAGE, membrane suspensions were solubilized at room temperature\nfor20minafteraddingaone-ﬁfthvolumeof10%(w/v)SDSand5%(w/v)DTT.\nProteins were stained by CBB (Sigma-Aldrich); alternatively, in case of\nsubsequent immunoblotting, they were stained by SYPRO Orange (Sigma-\nAldrich).TheSYPRO-stainedgelwastransferredontoaPVDFmembranethat\nwas subsequently incubated with speciﬁc primary antibody and then with\nsecondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-\nAldrich). The following primary antibodies were used in the study: anti-RubA\n(Shen et al., 2002b), anti-D1 (Komenda, 2005), anti-FLAG (Abgent, catalog\nnumberAP1013A;dilution50003),anti-PsaF(raisedinrabbitagainstpeptide\n50-61 of the Synechocystis PsaF), anti-PsaD (Li et al., 1991), anti-Ycf48 (Yu\net al., 2018), anti-PsaC (Agrisera, catalog number AS04 042P; dilution\n50003), anti-PsbO (Chapman et al., 1989), and anti-Psb27 (Komenda et al.,\n2012a).Forproteinlabeling,cellscontaining75mgoftotalChlwereincubated\nfor 30 min at an irradiance of 500 mmol photons m22 s21 in the presence of\na mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (MP Biomedicals) as described previously\n(Dobáková et al., 2009). Membranes were isolated from the labeled cells and\nsubjected to 2D protein separation described above. The 2D gel was stained\nby CBB, photographed, dried, exposed to a phosphorimager plate (GE\nHealthcare) overnight, and scanned with a Storm 860 (GE Healthcare).\nEnzymatic Digestion and Protein Identiﬁcation by MS\nFor identiﬁcation of proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass\nspectrometry (MS/MS), the CBB-stained bands were cut from the gel,\ndigested, and analyzed as described (Bu ˇcinská et al., 2018). For the matrix\nassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) MS anal-\nysis, proteins were digested for 8 h at 37°C in a cleavage buffer containing\n25 mM 4-ethylmorpholine acetate, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and protease\n(100 ng of trypsin [Promega] or 20 ng of Lys-C or 10 ng of Asp-N [Roche]).\nAliquots of Lys-C and Asp-N digests were further incubated for 4 h with\nAsp-N (10 ng) and trypsin (100 ng), respectively. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of\neach digest was deposited on the MALDI plate, air-dried at room tem-\nperature, and overlaid with 0.5 mL of the matrix solution (a-cyano-4-\nhydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) triﬂuoroacetic\nacid, 5 mg/mL [Sigma-Aldrich]). Peptide mass maps and MS/MS spectra\nwere measured on an Ultraﬂex III MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker Dal-\ntonics). For protein identiﬁcation, MS/MS spectra were searched against\nthe SwissProt 2019_02 database subset of Synechocystis proteins using\nan in-house MASCOT search engine.\nDetermination of Pigment Contents\nThe Chl content per cell was determined for ﬁve independent cultures\nafter methanol extraction of pigments according to Ritchie (2006).\nThe detection of tetrapyrrole biosynthetic precursors was performed by\nan Agilent 1200 HPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies). The ﬂuorescence\ndetector FLD1 was set to excitation/emission maxima of 440/660 nm to\ndetect the Chl precursors monovinyl-Chlide, divinyl-Chlide, monovinyl-\nPChlide, and divinyl-PChlide, while CoPP and PPIX were detected at 400/\n620 and 400/630 nm, respectively. Mg-protophorphyrin IX and MgPME\nwere detected on the ﬂuorescence detector FLD2 set to excitation/\nemission maxima of 416/595 nm (Pilný et al., 2015).\nFor determination of the heme content, the samples were extracted in\nacetone and injected into the HPLC instrument as described (Horáková\net al., 2017). For the HPLC measurements of tetrapyrroles, samples from\nthree independent cultures were taken.\nAssessment of Cellular ATP Content\nThreeindependent,exponentiallygrowingculturescontaining23109cells\nwere harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 500 mL of deionized\nwater, and broken mechanically for 20 s in Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec)\nusing 300 mL of balotina beads. The beads were removed by a quick spin\nat 3000g, and the phycobilisomes were precipitated with 2% (v/v) tri-\nchloroacetic acid. The precipitant was removed by centrifugation at\nmaximum speed for 5 min, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to\nneutral with 90 mM Na3PO4 (pH 11.5). A 50-mL sample was mixed in wells\nwith an equal amount of reaction mixture of a Cell Viability Kit (Promega).\nThe ATP content of the cell lysate was reﬂected by a luminescence signal\nthat was recorded by an Inﬁnite F200 plate reader (Tecan) after a 1000-ms\nintegration time.\nAccession Numbers\nSequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL\ndatabases under the following accession numbers: RubA (Slr2033),\nWP_010871719.1; Ycf48 (Slr2034), WP_010871720.1; D1 (Slr1311),\nWP_010871214.1; D2 (Sll0849), WP_010872429.1; CP43 (Sll0851),\nWP_014407100.1; CP47 (Slr0906), WP_010873685.1; Ycf39 (Slr0399),\nWP_010873152.1; Psb27 (Slr1645), WP_010873082.1; Psb28 (Sll1398),\nWP_010871246.1; HliC (Ss1633), WP_010872233.1; HliD (Ssr1789),\nWP_010871578.1; and CyanoP (Sll1418), WP_010872644.1.\nSupplemental Data\nSupplemental Figure 1.

The proposed method trains a machine learning model\nusing the structural alignment of known homologs. It is difﬁcult to directly predict sequence align-\nments using machine learning. Thus, when calculating sequence alignments, instead of a ﬁxed\nsubstitution matrix, this method dynamically predicts a substitution score from the trained model.\nWe evaluate our method by carefully splitting the training and test datasets and comparing the pre-\ndicted structure’s accuracy with that of state-of-the-art methods.

To reveal the functions of proteins, it is essential to\nunderstand the relationships between proteins’ structure and func-\ntion. Proteins that have similar functions are often evolutionarily\nrelated; these proteins are called homologs. Revealing homologs and\nstudying proteins’ structure to deduce their function are crucial mo-\nlecular biology techniques. Protein structures can be determined by\nexperimental means such as X-ray crystallography or nucleic mag-\nnetic resonance; protein structures derived in this way are often reg-\nistered to and accessible in the online Protein Databank (PDB)\n(Burley et al., 2018). However, despite improvements in experimen-\ntal methods for determining protein structures, the speed at which\namino acid sequences can be revealed has overtaken our ability to\nascertain the corresponding proteins’ structures. Therefore, protein\nstructure prediction, that is, the use of computational techniques to\ngenerate a tertiary structural model of a given amino acid sequence,\nremains essential.\nVarious methods for predicting a protein structure have been pro-\nposed and can be briefly classified as either physicochemical (also\ncalled de novo) simulations or template-free modeling methods. Other\nmethods, called template-based or homology modeling, predict struc-\ntures based on templates and their sequence alignment to a target pro-\ntein. Template structures are the structures of homologous proteins,\noften found with homology detection methods. Currently, template-\nbased modeling methods are the most practical because the predicted\nmodels are much more accurate if we can find good templates and\nprotein sequence alignments.

Hidden\nMarkov model (HMM)-based methods, a subset of sequence profile-\nbased methods, also detect remote homologs; HMM comparison\nmethods, such as HHpred (Zimmermann et al., 2018) have performed\nexcellently in structure prediction benchmarks (Hildebrand et al.,\n2009; Meier and So¨ding, 2015).\nRecent homology search methods have been able to detect re-\nmote homologs, although sometimes sufficiently accurate structure\nmodels cannot be obtained because the quality of the sequence align-\nment generated by homology detection program is poor. If a more\naccurate model is required, researchers must often edit alignments\nmanually before modeling to improve their quality. In structural\nalignment, the structural difference between a target protein struc-\nture and a template protein structure is minimized; thus, sequence\nalignments generated by structural alignment are ideal for template-\nbased modeling (Fig. 1). Often, the sequence alignments generated\nby the homology detection methods are dissimilar to those generated\nby structural alignment, especially for remote homologs. In essence,\nalignment quality is crucial to template-based modeling. Thus far, a\nmethod’s ability to detect remote homologs has been prioritized be-\ncause models cannot be generated without a template. However, to\nachieve higher-accuracy template-based modeling, the improvement\nof sequence alignment generation is a critical open problem.\nThis problem has been mentioned in several studies (Kopp et al.,\n2007) in which researchers have tried to improve alignments manually\nbased on their knowledge of biology; fully automated methods are still\nrequired. Hijikata et al. (2011) proposed an automated method to im-\nprove alignments by optimizing gap penalties. They evaluated the\npremise of gap location in protein 3D structures by examining large\nprotein structure datasets, and found that the distribution of gaps in\nprotein 3D structures differed from previous studies. However, they\nused the technique mainly for homology detection and the quality of\nits alignments for prediction model accuracy was still unclear.\nRecently, machine learning methods have demonstrated power\nin homology detection, fold recognition, residue contact map predic-\ntion, dihedral prediction, model quality assessment and secondary\nstructure prediction (Cao et al., 2016; Lyons et\nal., 2014;\nManavalan and Lee, 2017; Wang et al., 2016, 2017; Wei and Zou,\n2016). Machine learning also seems effective for tackling the prob-\nlem of alignment generation for homology modeling. However, this\ntopic has not been studied because it is difficult to treat alignment\ngeneration as a classification or regression problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a new pairwise sequence alignment gen-\neration method based on a machine learning model that learns the\nstructural alignments of known homologs. Because it is difficult to\ndirectly predict sequence alignment using machine learning, we in-\nstead use dynamic programming during sequence alignment to dy-\nnamically predict a substitution score from the learned model instead\nof a fixed substitution matrix or profile comparison. Machine learn-\ning is used in this substitution score prediction process. We evaluate\nthe proposed method using a carefully split training and test dataset\nand compare the accuracy of predicted structure models with those of\nstate-of-the-art methods as a measure of sequence alignment quality.\n2 Materials and methods\nGenerally, sequence alignment generation is integrated with the hom-\nology detection process and the detection tools output sequence align-\nments with homology search results from the database. In this study,\nwe focus only on alignment generation. Thus, the inputs are a target’s\namino acid sequence (query) and another amino acid sequence that\nwas detected as a template by any homology detection method (sub-\nject), and the output is an alignment that is more suitable for homology\nmodeling. This process is often called re-alignment. Figure 2 shows an\noverview of our method. The proposed method accepts query and sub-\nject amino acid sequences as input, then aligns their sequences using\nthe Smith–Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981). In clas-\nsical dynamic programming, a substitution matrix such as BLOSUM62\nor PAM250, is used to evaluate the match between residue pairs. To\nimprove alignment accuracy, profile comparison methods, including\nFORTE (Tomii and Akiyama, 2004) and FFAS (Rychlewski et al.,\n2008), use the similarity between two position-specific score matrices\n(PSSMs) of a target residue pair. In contrast, we evaluate residue\nmatches based on a supervised machine learning technique. We train a\nprediction model using pairwise structural alignments of structurally\nsimilar protein pairs as the labels of a training dataset. Thus, the\nmethod is expected to output similar sequence alignments by structural\nalignment. The PSSMs of two input sequences are used as input to the\nprediction model; to predict the match of a residue pair, PSSMs around\ntarget residues within a fixed size window are used. Finally, the method\nreturns a sequence alignment and an alignment score as output.\n2.1 Datasets\nOur method needs information about known structurally similar\nproteins to create structural alignments, for which we used the\nStructural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) (Fox et al., 2014;\nFig. 1. Model differences. Query (yellow) and template proteins are 1QG3A and\n1VA9A, respectively. The green model is generated from a structural alignment\n(TM-align), and the blue model is from HHsearch. The TM-scores of HHsearch\nand structural alignment are 0.801 and 0.881, respectively [Molecular graphics\nwere performed with the UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) package.] (Color\nversion of this ﬁgure is available at Bioinformatics online.)\nAlignment generation for accurate homology modeling\n105\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/1/104/5514048 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nMurzin et al., 1995) database. The SCOP database classifies pro-\nteins by class, folds, superfamily (SF), family and domain based on\nmanually curated function/structure classifications and contains re-\ndundant sequences. Thus, we used the SCOP40 database instead,\nwhich contains only domains whose sequence identity is <40% to\navoid overfitting and reduce execution time. In this study, we define\ndomains that are in the same SF as structurally similar.\nFor accurate evaluation and parameter optimization, we split\ntraining, test and validation datasets from the full dataset. We\nselected five domains each from seven SCOP classes to cover various\nprotein structure types, selecting test domains only from SFs con-\ntaining greater than ten domains. We ignored any small SFs and\nsorted the remaining domains by their PDB revision date, ultimately\nselecting 35 domains as test data. For our validation dataset, we\nsplit two groups from the remaining dataset. For one group, we\nselected one domain each from seven SCOP classes for parameter\nsearch; the other contains one domain each from the classes for a\ngap penalty search. Finally, we split 49 domains (¼35 þ 7 þ 7) from\nall the datasets for test and validation, and the remaining domains\nwere used for training (see Supplementary Tables S1–S3 for details).\nIn the training dataset, we generated structural alignments of\nevery domain pair in the same SF using TM-align (Zhang and\nSkolnick, 2005). We treated domain pairs whose TM-align score\n[TM-score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004)] was <0.5 as having low\nstructural similarity and filtered them out (Xu and Zhang, 2010). If\nthe SF had only one domain, it was ignored because we could not\ndefine a pairwise alignment for it. Finally, 140 889 pairwise struc-\ntural alignments were generated. For PSSM generation, we used\nthree-iteration\nPSI-BLAST\nwith\nthe\nUniRef90\n(The\nUniProt\nConsortium, 2016) database. When the training dataset became too\nlarge to process within a reasonable computation time, the training\ndataset was reduced to 1/10 of its initial size by random selection.\nFig. 2. Overview of the proposed method. Two sequences are aligned using the Smith–Waterman algorithm and substitution scores used in the process are esti-\nmated by a prediction model. The prediction model is trained to output an alignment similar to the structural alignment\nFig. 3. Overview of a feature vector encoding scheme. The X and Y axes show\nan amino acid sequence. The bold black line shows the structural alignment\npath between the sequences on the X and Y axes, with the green rectangle indi-\ncating the window. The feature vector set is calculated only within this window.\nThe feature vector is the concatenation of the PSSM columns of the window\nsubsequence. If the current column is on the line, the label is 1; otherwise, it is 0\n(Color version of this ﬁgure is available at Bioinformatics online.)\n106\nS.Makigaki and T.Ishida\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/1/104/5514048 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\n2.2 Input vector and label definition\nTo use machine learning methods to predict matching scores, we\nhad to encode information about residue pairs in a numerical vector\nrepresentation. In addition, we dealt with the problem as a binary\nclassification problem and used the reliability score of a prediction\nas a matching score, because structural alignment can only tell us\nwhether a position in a dynamic programming matrix is a match;\ndefining a correct matching score is difficult. Figure 3 shows an\noverview of this design.\nLet (Q, T) be the query and target sequences, respectively.\nLet Qi be the ith residue of sequence Q and Ti be the ith residue of\nsequence T. To encode amino acid sequences in a numerical vector,\nwe make PSSMs of the sequences in advance. The column length of\na PSSM is 20, which is the number of amino acid types, and the row\nlength is the length of the sequence. Feature vector Vx;y at Qx and Ty\nis the concatenation of the query and target residues’ feature\nvectors:\nVx;y ¼ ðPquery\nx\n; Ptarget\ny\nÞ:\nP is the concatenation of PSSM rows around the residue, defined as\nPi ¼ ðpi\u0002w\n2; . . . ; pi; . . . ; piþw\n2Þ;\nwhere w is the window size and pi is the ith row of the PSSM.\nRegarding ‘padding’ regions defined in i \u0003 0; jQj > i and jTj > i,\nwe assign pi to be 0. For example, in the case of w ¼ 5, the feature\nvector dimension is 200 ¼ 20 \u0004 5 \u0004 2.\nWe can define this feature vector at every residue pair of the\nquery and target sequences. However, we calculate them only within\nareas where the window moves along with the alignment path be-\ncause information from residue pairs that are far from the alignment\npath is not informative.\nWe assign label Lx,y at Qx and Ty to be 0 or 1:\nLx;y ¼\n1;\nif Qx matches Ty\n0;\notherwise:\n\u0002\nThe inputs are a pair of query and template PSSMs and a residue\nposition. The outputs are a predicted label and the normalized confi-\ndence score (0 \u0003 score \u0003 1).\n2.3 Alignment calculation\nThe pairwise sequence alignment of input sequences is calculated\nusing the Smith–Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981),\nwhich requires a substitution score for each residue pair. We predict\nthis score using supervised machine learning and the feature vector\ndefined above. Specifically, we used the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)\nclassification model because it is simple and powerful, especially for\nFig. 4. Result of gap penalty grid search. Values in the heatmap show the\naverage TM-score of the validation dataset. Penalties were optimized to -0.1\nfor gap-open and -0.0001 for gap-extend\nFig. 5. ROC of label prediction. The title is the target name shown in\nSupplementary Table S1; the average AUC is shown next to the name\nAlignment generation for accurate homology modeling\n107\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/1/104/5514048 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nlarge training datasets (Wu et al., 2008). kNN calculates the distance\nbetween an input feature vector Vx,y and feature vectors in training\ndataset Vtraining\nx;y\nand checks the labels of the k nearest feature vectors.\nGenerally, the most major label is output as the predicted label from\nkNN. In this case, 0 or 1 is output because this is a binary classification\nproblem. However, predicting binary labels is too coarse-grained for\nalignment generation. Thus, the classification confidence score of the\nkNN algorithm, which is the ratio of a predicted positive label, was\nused as the substitution score of Qx and Ty, instead.\n2.4 Parameter optimization\nOur method requires some hyperparameters, which we optimized\nusing the validation dataset. We set the number of nearest neighbors\nto (10, 100, 1000), the gap open penalty to (\u00020.0001, \u00020.001,\n\u00020.01, \u00020.1, \u00021), and the gap extend penalty to (\u00020.00001,\n\u00020.0001, -0.001, \u00020.01, \u00020.1, \u00021). Using a grid search, we selected\n1000 as the number of kNN neighbors. The affine gap penalty opti-\nmizations were \u00020.1 for gap-open and \u00020.0001 for gap-extend\n(Fig. 4). These gap penalties were much smaller than the general gap\npenalties used in other studies because our method’s predicted sub-\nstitution scores were too small for general gap penalties.\n3 Results\nIn our method, residue matches at two sequence positions is esti-\nmated by kNN. It can be considered as an independent binary classi-\nfication problem. Thus, we first checked the performance of the\nlabel prediction process using the receiver operating curve (ROC)\nand the area under the ROC (AUC). Figure 5 shows the results. The\nproposed method predicted labels accurately, except for d2axto1,\nwhich showed an almost random prediction.\nNext, we compared the accuracy of three-dimensional predicted\nprotein models generated from these alignments to evaluate the\nquality of generated sequence alignments. This step is required\nbecause there may not be strong correlation between match predic-\ntion and model accuracy and we cannot compare our method with\nother methods directly. We used MODELLER as a modeling tool\n(\u0002Sali and Blundell, 1993). We treated the entire SCOP40 domains,\nin which sequence similarities in an SF are <40%, in the SF where\nthe query is as a structurally similar protein and applied the pro-\nposed method to them. Model accuracy can be evaluated by calcu-\nlating the similarity between an experimentally resolved structure\nand a predicted structure. For this purpose, we used TM-score\n(Zhang and Skolnick, 2004), which evaluates model accuracy by\nscoring from 0.0 (least accurate) to 1.0 (most accurate).\nWe used all domains in the SF of the query as template\nproteins and generated pairwise alignments. We then compared the\naccuracy of the proposed method with those of PSI-BLAST,\nDELTA-BLAST, HHsearch (So¨ding, 2005), the Smith–Waterman al-\ngorithm with a BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, and structural\nalignment. For PSI-BLAST, which accepts a profile as a query, we\nmade profiles by running three iterative PSI-BLAST searches in the\nUniRef90 database. DELTA-BLAST allows us to use a sequence as a\nquery because it finds profiles from the Conserved Domain\nDatabase (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2010) before searching. For\nHHsearch, we used Uniclust20 (Mirdita et al., 2017) to generate\nquery profiles. We used TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) for\nstructural alignment.\nFigure 6 shows the accuracy of protein structure prediction. As\nexpected, structural alignments generated the most accurate models\n(0.551 on average), although the proposed method achieved results\nthat were nearly as accurate (0.499). The naı¨ve Smith–Waterman al-\ngorithm and HHsearch performed the next best; their average scores\nwere 0.432 and 0.472, respectively. From the results of data density,\nin all methods—including proposed method—these results had two\npeaks. The top-ranking models of all methods showed similar accur-\nacy, but the worst models’ accuracies improved when using the pro-\nposed method.\nFig. 6. Sequence-independent TM-score of the proposed and competitor methods. The solid line shows the medians and the dashed line shows the means. Dots\nindicate the data density at each TM-score\n108\nS.Makigaki and T.Ishida\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/1/104/5514048 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nIn Figure 7, we show as an example one of the generated models\nand an actual alignment, indicating that the proposed method could\nimprove model accuracy. The proposed method succeeded in align-\ning almost a whole protein and generated very similar alignment\nresults to the structural alignment method. In contrast, HHsearch\nfailed to correctly align a region around the 4th beta strand (residue\nnumbers 40–55) and caused structural differences from the native\nstructure in the loop regions on both sides of the sheet. Figure 7\nshows how the proposed method correctly aligned the region that\nHHsearch failed to align. The kNN predicted match score between\na query residue with residue number 49 and a template residue with\nresidue number 63 is much higher than the scores around the pos-\nition. Thus, the proposed method generated an alignment passing\nthrough the position.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Impact of model accuracy improvement for protein\nfunction estimation\nAs shown in our results, we achieved improved model accuracy in\nstructural similarity to a native structure. However, it is difficult to\njudge whether this improvement is useful for advanced applications,\nsuch as protein function estimation. The protein shown in Figure 7\nis fibronectin type domain of integrin b4, which makes a complex\nwith plectin’s actin-binding domain (Song et al., 2015). Thus, we\napplied a protein–protein docking to the modeled structures and a\nligand structure from the complex structure (PDB ID: 4Q58, Chain:\nA), using MEGADOCK 4.0 (Ohue et al., 2014) with the default set-\ntings, to check the influence of model accuracy. Figure 8 shows the\ndocking results using the model from the proposed method and that\nfrom HHsearch.\nThe best docking model selected from the top-10 models is\nshown. Where the docking calculation based on the HHsearch\nmodel failed to detect the correct binding position, the docking cal-\nculation based on the proposed method’s model succeeded. In the\nHHsearch model, a loop region after 4th b strand (the red circle in\nFig. 8) became longer than the correct structure because of this\nFig. 7. The yellow model in the top ﬁgure represents the native structure, the\nred model is generated by the proposed method, and the blue model is from\nHHsearch. The TM-scores of HHsearch and our method are 0.815 and 0.871,\nrespectively. The bottom ﬁgure is an excerpt of score heatmap and alignment\npaths. X and Y axes show the query (1QG3A) and template (1VA9A) residue\nnumbers, respectively. HHsearch (dotted dash) generated different align-\nments between #46 and #55 from the structural alignment (dash), whereas\nthe proposed method (solid) could generate similar alignments to the struc-\ntural alignment\nFig. 8. Docking results using modeled structures. The light purple model is\ngenerated by the proposed method and the light blue model is from\nHHsearch. The dark purple model is a ligand structure (plectin) docked by\nMEGADOCK using the model from the proposed model (ninth model,\nLRMSD ¼ 8.8 A˚ ), and the dark blue model is a ligand structure docked using\nthe model from HHsearch (fourth model, LRMSD ¼ 23.8 A˚ ). The light gray\nmodel drawn by Ca trace shows the correct position based on the native com-\nplex structure. The red circle shows a loop that HHsearch failed to model\ncorrectly\nAlignment generation for accurate homology modeling\n109\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/1/104/5514048 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nwrong alignment, causing a steric clash with the ligand structure. As\na result, the docking calculation failed to detect the correct binding\nposition and there was no docked result with ligand root mean\nsquared deviation (LRMSD) < 10 A˚ within 3000 models output by\nMEGADOCK. This is simply one example, but it indicates that the\nmodel accuracy improvement achieved with the proposed method is\nsometimes effective in aid our understanding of the function of a\nprotein.\n4.2 Application for homology detection\nOur method can be used for homology detection by sorting the\nalignment scores it includes in its result. We investigated the meth-\nod’s homology detection and the top model accuracies of a search\nresult ranking. The proposed method’s homology detection per-\nformance was compared with those of PSI/DELTA-BLAST and\nHHsearch, as shown in Table 1. To ensure a reasonable computa-\ntion time, the training dataset was reduced to 1/100 instead of 1/10.\nROCn considered results only up to the nth false positive and AUCn\nwas regularized by the number of false positives and cutoff n. In this\nevaluation, we defined true positives as those having the same\ndetected SF as the query and false positives as those having different\nSFs. Compared with PSI/DELTA-BLAST and HHsearch, the detec-\ntion sensitivity of the proposed method was lower. The highest aver-\nage AUC50 of HHsearch was 0.706. By contrast, the proposed\nmethod had the lowest score, 0.205. We think this is because the\nproposed method shows many false positive results.\nUsing the search results, we applied template-based modeling to\nthe top 10 search result and made 3D models; the models’ accuracy\nis mentioned in the second row of Table 1. The proposed method\nachieved the second-highest average TM-score, 0.298. From these\nresults, it is difficult to use our method for homology search.\nTherefore, we consider that our proposed method is currently useful\nfor the alignment generation phase of template-based modeling,\nafter template detection.\n4.3 Optimization of window size and the influence of\ntraining data reduction\nWe tested our method using (1, 3, 5) as window size candidates and\ncompared the label prediction accuracy using AUC. The results of\nwindow sizes (1, 3, 5) were 0.640, 0.689 and 0.701, respectively.\nWe also tested data reduction ratios of (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) and com-\npared the label prediction accuracy using AUC. The results for ratios\nof (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) were 0.635, 0.676 and 0.701, respectively.\nAlthough increasing the window size and reduction ratio may in-\ncrease accuracy, we could not evaluate them because the size of the\nrequired training dataset would be bigger than our computing\nresources can manage.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed a new sequence alignment generation\nmethod that uses machine learning to accurately predict protein struc-\ntures. Instead of a fixed substitution matrix, the proposed method\npredicts substitution scores at each residue pair. To apply machine\nlearning, we developed a method that converts pairwise alignments to\nnumerical vectors of latent space, which enables us to employ a super-\nvised machine learning algorithm for sequence prediction. The pre-\ndicted scores are directly used to generate alignments, which are in\nturn used as input for template-based modeling. We evaluated the\nmodel accuracy of our alignment generation method and found that\nit outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. We also investigated\nour method’s ability to detect remote homologies; using AUC50 for\ncomparison, our method did not perform better than other methods.\nHowever, we found that the proposed method generated relatively ac-\ncurate 3D models compared with other methods.\nCurrently, our method requires a long execution time because of\nthe kNN algorithm and dataset size. These factors caused us to re-\nduce the amount of training data used because the model’s execution\ntime depends on the number of target proteins as well as protein\nsize. It would be a natural extension of this work to employ faster\nkNN algorithms, including approximate schemes, because our\nmethod does not require precise solutions. The proposed feature\nvector design can be treated as two-dimensional; in the future, we\nwill also consider the use of higher-performance models such as con-\nvolutional neural networks.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [18K11524].\nAuthor contributions\nS.M. conducted the computational experiments and wrote the\nmanuscript.

Colbran\nThe guanylyl cyclase-activating protein, GCAP1, activates\nphotoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in the light,\nwhen free Ca2\u0002 concentrations decline, and decelerates the\ncyclase in the dark, when Ca2\u0002 concentrations rise. Here, we\nreport a novel mutation, G86R, in the GCAP1 (GUCA1A) gene\nin a family with a dominant retinopathy. The G86R substitution\nin a “hinge” region connecting EF-hand domains 2 and 3 in\nGCAP1 strongly interfered with its Ca2\u0002-dependent activator-\nto-inhibitor conformational transition. The G86R-GCAP1 var-\niant activated RetGC at low Ca2\u0002 concentrations with higher\naffinity than did the WT GCAP1, but failed to decelerate the\ncyclase at the Ca2\u0002 concentrations characteristic of dark-\nadaptedphotoreceptors.Ca2\u0002-dependentincreaseinTrp94fluo-\nrescence, indicative of the GCAP1 transition to its RetGC inhib-\niting state, was suppressed and shifted to a higher Ca2\u0002 range.\nConformational changes in G86R GCAP1 detectable by isother-\nmal titration calorimetry (ITC) also became less sensitive to\nCa2\u0002, and the dose dependence of the G86R GCAP1–RetGC1\ncomplex inhibition by retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein was\nshifted toward higher than normal concentrations. Our results\nindicate that the flexibility of the hinge region between\nEF-hands 2 and 3 is required for placing GCAP1-regulated Ca2\u0002\nsensitivity of the cyclase within the physiological range of intra-\ncellular Ca2\u0002 at the expense of reducing GCAP1 affinity for the\ntarget enzyme. The disease-linked mutation of the hinge Gly86,\nleading to abnormally high affinity for the target enzyme and\nreduced Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of GCAP1, is predicted to abnormally\nelevate cGMP production and Ca2\u0002 influx in photoreceptors in\nthe dark.\nGuanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs),4 N-myristoy-\nlated calcium/magnesium-binding proteins of the EF-hand\nsuperfamily, are comprised of two pairs of EF-hand domains\nconnected via a “hinge” region (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2).\nAmong several isoforms of GCAPs expressed in the vertebrate\nretinas (3–6) two, GCAP1 and GCAP2, regulate visual signaling\nin all species by properly shaping the sensitivity and kinetics of\nrod and cone responses (7–10). Vertebrate rods and cones\nrespond to light stimuli by closing cGMP-gated channels in\ntheir outer segments via phototransduction cascade-mediated\nhydrolysis of cGMP (reviewed in Refs. 11 and 12). Following the\nexcitation, cGMP production by retinal membrane guanylyl\ncyclase (RetGC) (13–15) first becomes accelerated, to speed up\nthe recovery and light adaptation of photoreceptors, and then\ndecelerated again as photoreceptors recover from the excita-\ntion back to their dark-adapted state (7, 16). Negative Ca2\u0002\nfeedback regulates the activity of RetGC via its Ca2\u0002 sensor\nproteins, GCAPs, such that in the light, when cGMP channels\nare closed and the influx of Ca2\u0002 through the channels stops,\nGCAPs release Ca2\u0002 and convert into a Mg2\u0002-liganded state\nthat stimulates RetGC. Once the photoreceptors return to their\ndark-adapted state, when cGMP channels re-open and the\ninflux of Ca2\u0002 resumes, GCAPs undergo the reverse, activator-\nto-inhibitor, transition, by replacing Mg2\u0002 in their EF-hands\nwith Ca2\u0002, and decelerate RetGC (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 12).\nFailure of RetGC to accelerate or decelerate cGMP production\nwithin the normal range of the intracellular free Ca2\u0002 alters\nlight sensitivity and kinetics of rod and cone response to light\n(7–9, 16–18) and has been linked to various forms of retinal\nblindness in humans, such as Leber congenital amaurosis, dom-\ninant cone or cone-rod degenerations (reviewed in Ref. 19–22),\nand a recessive night blindness (23). Multiple mutations linked\nto these blinding disorders have been found in the genes co-\nding for RetGC1 isozyme (GUCY2D) (19–27) and GCAP1\n(GUCA1A) (28–40).

Here we describe a new type of mutation in GCAP1,\nG86R, leading to a dominant retinopathy in humans. We pres-\nent evidence that the flexible hinge Gly86 connecting the semi-\nglobules formed by the two pairs of EF-hands reduces GCAP1\naffinity for RetGC1 but also adjusts the Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of the\nactivator-to-inhibitor transition to the proper physiological\nrange of RetGC1 regulation by Ca2\u0002. We reason that the G86R\nmutation in GCAP1 would trigger photoreceptor death by\nabnormally elevating cGMP production rate in the dark.\nResults\nG86R GUCA1A causes dominant retinopathy\nThe patient evaluated at 62 years of age had no history of\nvisual problems (other than myopia) until his 5th decade of life.\nHe was then diagnosed as having a macular dystrophy. Best\ncorrected visual acuities at age 56 were 20/60 and 20/200. Read-\ning and distance vision decreased progressively over many\nyears; and color discrimination became difficult. There was no\nphotosensitivity and no peripheral field or night vision com-\nplaints. The patient did not report any general health issues and\nhe was not taking medication with known retinotoxic effects.\nVisual acuities of the proband were 20/200 (with no significant\nrefractive error) in both eyes. The clinical examination was\nwithin normal limits except for the retina. Maculae were gran-\nular and thinned in appearance. Peripheral retina, optic nerve,\nand vessel caliber were normal. Macular functional abnormal-\nities were supported by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dis-\nease apparent on en face imaging (Results and Fig. S1) and ret-\ninal structural changes on cross-sectional imaging. Optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) (Fig. 1A) showed loss of central\nretinal lamination suggesting complete degeneration of rod and\ncone photoreceptors. By 10o from the fovea, however, outer\nnuclear layer (ONL, where rod and cone photoreceptor nuclei\nare located, highlighted blue) thickness returned to normal.\nBeyond the perifoveal region, there was a mild thinning of both\ncone and rod outer segments extending across the width of the\nscan (Fig. 1, right panels). Illustrating these photoreceptor\nabnormalities are magnified images (lower panels). Shortened\nouter segments where phototransduction occurs is likely one of\nthe contributors to the loss of visual function. Electrophysi-\nological (Fig. 1B) and perceptual (45) (Results and Fig. S1)\nresults suggested mild dysfunction across the retina of both rod\nand cone photoreceptor-driven function, and a severe loss of\nmacular function.\nThe family history of the proband (Fig. 1C, III, 2) indicated 6\nother members with visual symptoms, suggesting an autosomal\ndominant mode of inheritance, although there was no male-to-\nmale transmission. DNA samples from the proband and two\nother affected family members (III, 3; and IV, 1) were studied. In\nthe proband, a panel of genes associated with inherited retinal\ndegenerations was screened using next-generation sequencing\nfollowed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing. A novel heterozy-\ngous missense variant, c.256G 3 C, in the GUCA1A gene was\nidentified in the proband and in other affected family members\nby direct testing in the GUCA1A gene. In the disease-causing\nvariant, Gly86, residue that connects the exiting helix of EF-\nhand 2 and the entering helix of EF-hand 3, thus creating a\nhinge between the semiglobules of GCAP1 formed by two pairs\nof EF-hand domains (Fig. 2), was substituted by Arg.\nThe G86R mutation in GCAP1 reduces Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of\nguanylyl cyclase regulation\nG86R GCAP1 effectively activated human RetGC1 expressed\nin HEK293 cells at low free Ca2\u0002 concentrations, similarly to\nthe WT GCAP1 (Fig. 3, A and B), but failed to effectively decel-\nerate the cyclase when free Ca2\u0002 concentrations rise. The\n[Ca]1/2 values became shifted to 5-fold higher free Ca2\u0002 in both\nbovine and human orthologs of GCAP1. In the case of human\nGCAP1, the [Ca]1/2 (mean \u0004 S.D.) for G86R increased to 0.94 \u0004\n0.09 \u0002M (n \u0005 4) from 0.14 \u0004 0.06 \u0002M (n \u0005 3) in WT (p \u0005 0.0004,\nunpaired/unequal variance Student’s t test). As a result, the\nRetGC1 remained stimulated by the G86R GCAP1 at free Ca2\u0002\nconcentrations that by far exceeded those found in dark-\nadapted mammalian photoreceptors (17, 47).\nThe affinities of GCAP1 to RetGC1 in both the Mg2\u0002 and\nCa2\u0002-liganded states are nearly equal (Fig. 4 and Ref. 48). How-\never, replacement of the hinge Gly86 increased the GCAP1\napparent affinity for RetGC1 in the activator state of the\nmutant, KGCAPMg \u0005 0.34 \u0004 0.063 \u0002M, n \u0005 4, versus 1.42 \u0004 0.061\n\u0002M, n \u0005 3, in WT (p \u0006 0.0001) (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas the\naffinity of the Ca2\u0002-liganded G86R was increased to a lesser\nextent: KGCAPCa \u0005 0.59 \u0004 0.047 M versus 1.44 \u0004 0.14 \u0002M in WT,\nn \u0005 4 (p \u0005 0.001) (Fig. 4C). The G86R GCAP1 gaining higher\naffinity for the cyclase in Mg2\u0002- than in the Ca2\u0002-liganded\nform, resulting in change of the KGCAPMg versus KGCAPCa, can\naccount for a \u00072-fold increase in [Ca]1/2 (Fig. 4 and Ref. 48).\nNonetheless, this difference alone did not account for the\n\b6-fold [Ca]1/2 increase observed in Fig. 3B, thus suggesting\nthat Gly86, despite its being not a part of the EF-hand motif per\nse, but a hinge between the two semiglobules of the molecule\n(Fig. 2) nonetheless affected GCAP1 affinity for Ca2\u0002.\nActivator-to-inhibitor transition in G86R GCAP1 requires\nhigher Ca2\u0002 concentrations\nThe dependence of the intrinsic GCAP1 Trp fluorescence on\nCa2\u0002 (Fig. 5) is biphasic: first reduction and then increase of\nintensity, reflecting GCAP1 transition from a metal-free to a\nmetal-bound state (49–51). The “phase I” (decrease in fluores-\ncence) reflects GCAP1 conversion to a partially Ca2\u0002- or\nMg2\u0002-liganded “cyclase-activator” state, and “phase II” is the\nincrease specifically in Trp94 fluorescence, caused by Ca2\u0002\nbinding in EF-hand 4, which converts GCAP1 to its “cyclase-\ninhibitor” state (50, 51). Phase I in the absence of Mg2\u0002 is less\npronounced in human GCAP1 compared with the bovine\nGCAP1 (50, 51), because although both have Trp21 and Trp94,\nthe human ortholog lacks Trp51 contributing to the phase I\namplitude. However, the two Ca2\u0002-dependent phases of the\ncGMP synthesis and photoreceptor blindness\nJ. Biol. Chem. (2019) 294(10) 3476–3488 3477\n\nfluorescence remained clearly identifiable in the human\nGCAP1. In G86R GCAP1, Ca2\u0002-sensitivity of the fluorescence\nspectrum was markedly shifted toward higher range. The Ca2\u0002-\ndependent phase II can be further isolated by eliminating phase\nI by first saturating GCAP1 with Mg2\u0002 (50, 51). The resultant\nphase II (Fig. 5B) in G86R GCAP1 demonstrated a shift toward\nhigher Ca2\u0002 concentrations and drastic reduction of the ampli-\ntude at saturating Ca2\u0002 compared with the WT. The Ca2\u0002-\nspecific increase in fluorescence intensity at 200 \u0002M Ca2\u0002 ver-\nsus 0 \u0002M Ca2\u0002 was lacking, 1.04-fold \u0004 0.02 (S.D.), compared\nFigure 1.

(2019) 294(10) 3476–3488\n\nwith the WT (1.51 \u0004 0.09, n \u0005 3, p \u0005 0.0074, Student’s t test),\nthus indicating that the activator-to-inhibitor conformational\ntransition was restrained even at saturating free Ca2\u0002.\nTo further isolate the phase II fluorescence component of the\nCa2\u0002-dependent activator-to-inhibitor transition in a human\nG86R GCAP1, phase I was eliminated using a W21F substitu-\ntion (51). The remaining single Trp94 fluorescence in human\nGCAP1 was measured in the absence of Mg2\u0002 (Fig. 6A), in the\npresence of near-physiological 0.9 mM free Mg2\u0002 (52) (Fig. 6B)\nor at saturating 9 mM free Mg2\u0002 (Fig. 6C). In all cases, the fold-\nincrease of Ca2\u0002-dependent Trp94 fluorescence of G86R\nGCAP1, defining its transition to the state decelerating RetGC1\nactivity, became reduced: 1.50 \u0004 0.018 in W21F/G86R versus\n2.30 \u0004 0.13 in W21F alone (p \u0005 0.0052, Student’s t test), 1.71 \u0004\n0.04 versus 2.68 \u0004 0.13 (p \u0005 0.01), and 1.85 \u0004 0.036 versus\n3.13 \u0004 0.055 (p \u0006 0.0001), respectively. It also required higher\nfree Ca2\u0002 concentrations for the transition to occur (Fig. 6,\nD–F): the respective EC50 values were 0.85 \u0004 0.065 \u0002M versus\n0.050 \u0004 0.003 \u0002M (p \u0005 0.0023), 0.713 \u0004 0.03 \u0002M versus 0.133 \u0004\n0.006 \u0002M (p \u0005 0.0009), and 1.53 \u0004 0.2 \u0002M versus 0.72 \u0004 0.05 \u0002M\n(p \u0005 0.011). The difference in the Ca2\u0002-dependent transition to\nthe cyclase-inhibitor state between the W21F mutants in G86R\nversus WT GCAP1 backbone (Fig. 6, D–F) was also more pro-\nnounced in the absence or at low physiological (52) concentra-\ntions of Mg2\u0002. The respective [Ca]1/2 ratios (Fig. 6G) at 0, 0.9,\nand 9 mM Mg2\u0002 were 17.7 \u0004 1.47, 5.36 \u0004 0.28, and 2.14 \u0004 0.27\n(p \u0006 0.0001 for all pairs), indicating that the GCAP1 affinity for\nMg2\u0002 in the EF-hand 4 also became reduced as a result of the\nmutation in the hinge region.\nG86R mutation alters the thermodynamics of the\nCa2\u0002-dependent conformational changes in GCAP1\nChanges of the heat release by GCAP1 upon metal binding\nreflect a superposition of several processes including not only\ndirect interaction of metal and protein, but conformational\nchanges and reorganization of the protein-water shell as well\n(39, 53, 54) (Fig. 7). Therefore, the parameters for metal binding\nformally extracted from the ITC measurements describe the\napparent metal affinity, but they do not match exactly those\nrevealed by the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or RetGC1\nregulation sensitivity (53). However, despite this limitation the\ncomparison of the formal parameters extracted from ITC still\nreflects the change in the GCAP1 thermodynamics imparted by\nmutations (39, 53–54). In case of G86R in the presence of 1 mM\nMg2\u0002 (Fig. 7), the net heat release pattern in response to bind-\ning Ca2\u0002 changed from triphasic to biphasic and the endother-\nmic component was more pronounced than in WT (Fig. 7, A\nand B). However, best fit of the data were obtained with a\nsequential binding model resulting in two apparent KD values\nfor the WT and the G86R mutant (Fig. 7, A and B, and Table 1).\nDue to residual free Ca2\u0002 (90–200 nM; see “Experimental pro-\ncedures”) in the presence of 20–30 \u0002M GCAP1 variants, we\nassume partial or full saturation of a high affinity Ca2\u0002-binding\nsite in human GCAP1. The apparent affinity of Ca2\u0002-binding\nwas, however, different and became less in case of G86R (see\nvalues for KD\n1 and KD\n2 in Table 1). Parameters for Ca2\u0002 binding\nto GCAP1 variants in the absence of Mg2\u0002 exhibited a similar\noverall pattern (Table 1). In addition, G86R GCAP1 was more\nsensitive to the metal binding in Mg2\u0002-dependent heat release\ntested by ITC (Fig. 7, C and D). Enthalpy changes were endo-\nthermic in both cases and best fit was obtained with a two-site\nmodel indicating conformational changes caused primarily by\nMg2\u0002 binding in two EF-hands, occurring in a noncooperative\nmanner.\nSensitivity of RetGC1–GCAP complex to inhibition by RD3\nRD3 (retinal degeneration 3) protein inhibits both RetGCs\nbasal activity and GCAP-stimulated activity (55, 56). The\nability of RD3 to suppress activation of RetGC1 is likely\nrequired for normal survival of photoreceptors, because rods\nand cones lacking RD3 degenerate much faster and more\nseverely than those completely lacking both RetGC1 and\nRetGC2 isozymes, altogether (56). We found that activation\nof the cyclase by G86R GCAP1 becomes more resistant to\ninhibition by RD3 than the cyclase activated by WT RD3\n(Fig. 8). The EC50 rose to 17.1 \u0004 2.8 nM, n \u0005 3, versus 1.7 \u0004\n0.4 nM, n \u0005 3, in WT (p \u0005 0.0007).\nDiscussion\nClinical features of the disease caused by G86R GCAP1\nThe dominant retinopathy caused by G86R substitution\npresents a new example of a photoreceptor dystrophy linked to\nthe mutations in GCAP1 (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). The clinical dis-\nease feature in common with previous studies of families with\nGUCA1A mutations coding for GCAP1 (28–38) has been\nmaculopathy with central retinal defects documented by func-\ntional and structural parameters (reviewed in Refs. 31 and 32).\nFigure 2. A mutation in the GUCA1A gene of the dominant retinopathy\npatient replaces the hinge Gly86 of GCAP1. The linear diagram of GCAP1\nprimary structure (top) indicates the position of four helix-loop-helix EF-hand\ndomains (a nonmetal binding EF1 and the three metal binding EF2, -3, and -4)\nand the position of the hinge Gly86 residue (marked yellow). A Gly 3 Cys\ntransversion in codon 256 of a human GUCA1A gene coding for GCAP1\nreplaces Gly86 with Arg. The hinge Gly86 connects the semiglobules of GCAP1\nformed by two pairs of EF-hand domains (EF1 \u0002 EF2 and EF3 \u0002 EF4), depicted\nin a ribbon (left) and a space-filled (right) diagram. The N-myristoyl residue,\nembedded into the EF1/EF2 semiglobule, is marked orange; the side chains\nrequired for forming interface with the RetGC1 are shown in red, and the side\nchains not essential for forming the interface are shown in blue (after Pesh-\nenko et al. (46)). The Ca2\u0002 ions coordinated in three EF-hand loops are marked\ngreen. The structural model is based on the Stephen et al. (77) GCAP1 crystal\nstructure.\ncGMP synthesis and photoreceptor blindness\nJ. Biol. Chem. (2019) 294(10) 3476–3488 3479\n\nIn addition to central cone disease, some patients in the previ-\nous studies also had cone photoreceptor dysfunction in extra-\ncentral retina and others have had cone as well as rod dysfunc-\ntion. Of interest, a postmortem donor retina from a 75-year-old\npatient clinically diagnosed as having a cone degeneration by\nERG criteria at age 45 years has been studied by histopathology;\nand the disease cause was a GUCA1A mutation (36, 57). As in\nthe present study, there was central retinal atrophy, widespread\ncone disease by cone ERG, and, despite a normal full-field rod\nERG, rod inner and outer segment abnormalities beyond the\nmacula. The clinical spectrum due to GUCA1A mutations thus\nincludes macular degeneration, and retina-wide cone and rod\ndysfunction where cone disease may be equal to or greater than\nrod disease.\nMolecular mechanisms of retinopathies caused by GCAP\nmutations\nThe majority of the known examples of retinopathies linked\nto the GUCA1A gene originate from mutations in GCAP1 EF-\nhand motifs that disable Ca2\u0002 binding in EF-hands 3 and 4\n(28–40, 58, 59). Reduction of Ca2\u0002 affinity in these EF-hands\nleads to overly active production of cGMP at normal free Ca2\u0002\nconcentrations in the dark, increasing the fraction of the open\ncGMP-gated channels and accelerating the influx of Ca2\u0002 into\nphotoreceptor outer segment (17, 18, 41). The overall Ca2\u0002\nsensitivity of GCAP1 imparted by the intrinsic ability of their\nEF-hands to bind Ca2\u0002 or Mg2\u0002 is additionally fine-tuned by a\n“calcium-myristoyl tug” (1, 43), a structural link between the\nC-proximal EF-hand 4 and the N-terminal myristoyl residue\nFigure 3. The G86R mutation in GCAP1 alters RetGC1 regulation by Ca2\u0002. Recombinant RetGC1 was reconstituted with 10 \u0002M bovine (A) or human (B) WT\n(\u0002) or G86R (●) GCAP1 and assayed at different free Ca2\u0002 concentrations at 0.9 mM free Mg2\u0002. Data (mean \u0004 S.D.) averaged from 3 to 4 independent\nexperiments in each case were fitted using a Hill function, (Amax \t Amin)/(1 \u0002 ([Ca]/[Ca]1/2)H) \u0002 Amin, where Amax and Amin are the respective maximal and\nminimal activity, [Ca], free Ca2\u0002 concentration, [Ca]1/2 is the free Ca2\u0002 concentration at half-maximal activity, and H, Hill coefficient. Note that whereas the Amax\nof the G86R-stimulated cyclase only slightly exceeds the WT levels, the [Ca]1/2 shifts \b5-fold toward higher Ca2\u0002 range, and even at saturating Ca2\u0002 the G86R\nGCAP1 partially activates RetGC1, thus rendering the cyclase constitutively active.\nFigure 4. Change in G86R GCAP1 affinity for the cyclase contributes to its altered Ca2\u0002 sensitivity. A, calcium sensitivity of the RetGC cyclase ([Ca]1/2)\ndepends on three dissociation constants defining the affinity of GCAP for Ca2\u0002 (KCa), the affinity of the Mg2\u0002-liganded GCAP for RetGC (KGCAP*), and the affinity\nof Ca2\u0002-liganded GCAP for RetGC (KGCAPca) in the equation shown on the right (48). WT GCAP1 has similar affinities for the cyclase regardless of the metal ligand\n(48), hence the [Ca]1/2 is dominated primarily by KCa. B and C, dose dependence of RetGC1 activation by GCAP1. RetGC1 was reconstituted with increasing\nconcentrations of WT (E) or G86R (●, red) human GCAP1 at saturating 10 mM Mg2\u0002 in the absence of Ca2\u0002 (B) or at 0.9 mM Mg2\u0002 in the presence of 100 \u0002M Ca2\u0002\n(C).NotethatG86RGCAP1gainshigheraffinityforthecyclaseintheMg2\u0002form(B)thanintheCa2\u0002form(C),andtherespectivechangesinKGCAP*versusKGCAPCa\ncan account for nearly 2-fold increase in [Ca]1/2, see Equation I. The data (mean \u0004 S.D.) averaged from 3 to 4 independent measurements were fitted using a\nsigmoidal function, (Amax \t Amin)/(1 \u0002 ([GCAP]/KGCAPCa)\tH) \u0002 Amin, where Amax and Amin are the respective maximal and minimal activity, H, Hill coefficient\n(between 0.9 and 1.3 in all cases).

(2019) 294(10) 3476–3488\n\nembedded in the semi-globule formed by the N-proximal EF-\nhands 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Leu176 replacement by Phe, through the\naltered tug action, increases GCAP1 affinity for RetGC1 but\nalso reduces the affinity of the EF-hand 4 for Ca2\u0002 and thus\nshifts Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of RetGC regulation outside the physio-\nlogical range (43). The L176F substitution, originally used to\nchange the calcium-myristoyl tug in GCAP1 in vitro (43), was\nsoon after found in patients with a photoreceptor dystrophy\n(44), likely triggered by elevated cGMP production in the dark.\nIn contrast to the multiple mutations in GCAP1 affecting\nRetGC1 sensitivity to Ca2\u0002 causing cone- and cone-rod degen-\nerations, a rare retinopathy accompanied by G157R mutation\nin GCAP2 (GUCA1B) affects primarily rods (60). The mutant\nGCAP2 is more prone to accumulating in photoreceptor inner\nsegment (61), but its mechanistic significance in triggering pho-\ntoreceptor death remains unclear.\nOur present results show that not only EF-hands and calci-\num-myristoyl tug in GCAP1, but the hinge Gly86 located\nbetween the two semiglobules formed by EF-hand pairs is crit-\nical for defining the normal Ca2\u0002 sensitivity in the whole-mol-\necule structure of GCAP1. A dominant retinopathy (Fig. 1)\noccurs when the hinge is affected. The two semiglobules in\nGCAP1 connected by the Gly86 (Fig. 2) can move relative to\neach other (51, 62). Apparently, this flexibility contributes to\ninteraction with the cyclase and Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of the target\nenzyme regulation, similarly to the calcium-myristoyl tug (43).\nNotably, the residues surrounding Gly86 were implicated in\nforming the complex between GCAP1 and RetGC1 (46). The\nG86R substitution imparts an abnormally high affinity to the\ninterface for the target enzyme at the expense of making\nGCAP1 Ca2\u0002 sensitivity abnormally low. The net outcome is a\ndrastic increase of the cyclase activity at the free concentrations\nof Ca2\u0002 typical for the dark-adapted photoreceptors. Even if the\nshift in Ca2\u0002 sensitivity of the cyclase caused by the G86R\nGCAP1 is attenuated by competition with normal GCAP1 and\nGCAP2 (58), it should inevitably increase the cGMP synthesis\nrate, open an excessive number of the cGMP-gated channels,\nand increase the influx of Ca2\u0002 in dark-adapted rods and cones,\nlike other retinal diseases triggered by similar dysregulation of\nthe cyclase (17–18, 41).\nAlong with the calcium-myristoyl tug in GCAP1 (43), which\nis functionally and structurally distinct from the calcium-myr-\nistoyl switch prototypically observed in recoverin (63, 64), the\nflexibility of the hinge region in the GCAP1 structure evidently\nprovides the optimal trade-off between the affinity for the tar-\nget and the sensitivity of its regulation by physiological intra-\ncellular Ca2\u0002. EF-hand 1 (Fig. 2) has evolved in GCAPs to\nbecome the main part of the target-binding interface, instead of\nbeing a metal-binding domain (46, 65). Three other EF-hands\ncontribute differently to the cyclase regulation. EF-hands 2 and\n3 bind Mg2\u0002 or Ca2\u0002 to properly present the target-binding\ninterface and thus allow GCAP to dock with the cyclase (66, 67).\nThe pair of the C-proximal EF hands 3 and 4 is the actual Ca2\u0002\nsensor part of the molecule that enables the GCAP switch\nbetween the Mg2\u0002-bound state in the light to the Ca2\u0002-bound\nstate in the dark and cause the activator-to-inhibitor transition\nof GCAP1 (51, 53, 66, 67). This transition is affected by the\nblinding G86R mutation, such that GCAP1’s preferential state\nnow gains higher affinity for RetGC1, is more prone to remain\nin a Mg2\u0002-bound state and less susceptible to undergo the tran-\nsition to the Ca2\u0002-bound inhibitor state (Figs. 3–7).\nNotably, the overall susceptibility of G86R GCAP1 to con-\nverting into a Mg2\u0002-liganded state in the ITC experiments\nincreases (Fig. 7), in contrast to the Mg2\u0002 effect on the intrinsic\nTrp94 fluorescence reflecting GCAP1 transition upon Mg2\u0002 to\nCa2\u0002 replacement in EF-hand 4 (Fig. 6), which is more drasti-\ncally affected at normal physiological Mg2\u0002 than at saturating\nMg2\u0002 concentrations. This indicates that in EF-hand 4, respon-\nsible for the Ca2\u0002-dependent fluorescence increase in Trp94 in\nthe neighboring EF-hand \u0003-helix (51), the Mg2\u0002 binding affin-\nity is reduced, whereas in the EF-hand 2 and/or -3 it becomes\nstrengthen. The Mg2\u0002 binding in EF-2 and EF-3 is essential for\nthe overall ability of GCAP1 to dock with the cyclase (67) and\nless critical for the GCAP1 switching between the activator and\nthe inhibitor states, primarily driven by Ca2\u0002 binding in EF-4\n(51, 66). The current ITC experiments are unable to identify the\nFigure 5. The G86R substitution affects Ca2\u0002-dependent activator-to-inhibitor transition in GCAP1.

Physi-\nological concentrations of Mg2\u0002 in the photoreceptor outer\nsegment are near 1 mM (52), so the increase of Mg2\u0002 affinity in\nEF-hands other than EF-4 would unlikely affect RetGC regulation\nby G86R GCAP1, because their affinities even in WT are already\nhighenoughtomaintainGCAP1intheactivatorstate.Incontrast,\nthe decrease in metal affinity of EF-4 is critical, preventing the\nproper activator-to-inhibitor transition in the dark.\nIncreased cGMP production in the dark is detrimental for\nphotoreceptor viability. A body of evidence from in vivo studies\nusing transgenic animal models also demonstrate that dysregu-\nlation of the negative Ca2\u0002 feedback on RetGC, either via alter-\ning the Ca2\u0002-sensor properties of GCAPs or via preferentially\nincreasing the affinity of the cyclase for the activator form of\nGCAP1 lead to severe retinal pathology (17, 18, 41, 80). Our\npresent study argues that triggering a blinding disease by\nGCAP1 can result by affecting its Ca2\u0002 sensitivity through\na mechanistic reason different from directly disabling an EF-\nhand or calcium-myristoyl tug in GCAP1. This adds a new dis-\ntinct example to the array of diverse molecular mechanisms\nthrough which retinal guanylyl cyclase can become dysregu-\nlated by GCAP1 and cause dominant retinopathy.\nCompetition of the G86R GCAP1 with RD3 becomes more\neffective\nRD3 protein (68, 69) is required for effective accumulation of\nRetGC in the outer segment (70, 71) and also inhibits RetGC\nFigure 6.

A–C, the phase I was eliminated using a W21F substitution (51), and the\nCa2\u0002-dependent Trp94 fluorescence was measured in the absence of Mg2\u0002 (A), in the presence of physiological 0.9 mM free Mg2\u0002 (B) or at saturating 9 mM free\nMg2\u0002 (C). The fluorescence intensity (mean \u0004 S.D., three independent measurements) was normalized per that at low Ca2\u0002. D-F, the respective fractional\nchanges in fluorescence, (F \t Fmin)/(Fmax \t Fmin), from panels A–C were fitted using a sigmoidal function, 1/(1 \u0002 ([Ca]1/2/[Ca])H, where Fmax and Fmin are the\nrespective maximal and minimal fluorescence, [Ca] 1/2 is a free Ca2\u0002 concentration at half-maximal effect, and H is a Hill coefficient. G, the [Ca]1/2 W21F/G86R:\n[Ca]1/2 W21F ratio is much larger at the lower concentrations of Mg2\u0002, indicating that the G86R affinity for Mg2\u0002 binding affecting Trp94 exposure is also\nreduced compared with the WT.

The inhibitory function of RD3,\nwhich likely occurs in the inner segment (71), is essential for the\nsurvival of photoreceptors, because rods and cones lacking the\nRD3-dependent inhibition of RetGC degenerate much faster\nand more severely than those completely lacking RetGC itself\n(56). The cyclase activated by G86R GCAP1 resists the inhibi-\ntion by RD3 more effectively (Fig. 8), because the mutant\nGCAP1 now has higher affinity for the cyclase (Fig. 3). A similar\neffect was previously observed in the case of CORD6-linked\nmutation in Arg838 of RetGC1, which increases RetGC affinity\nfor GCAP1 (18, 80). According to a hypothesis that is currently\nunder investigation, inhibition of RetGC1 by RD3 is required\nfor preventing premature activation of the cyclase by GCAPs,\nwhereas in transit from the inner segment (55, 56, 69). It is\nconceivable that the G86R GCAP1 outcompetes RD3 and\nTable 1\nThermodynamic parameter of Ca2\u0002 and Mg2\u0002 binding to human WT\nGCAP1 and the mutant G86R derived from ITC measurements\nCa2\u0002 titrations were done in the absence or presence of 1 mM Mg2\u0002 (where indi-\ncated in parentheses).

This, in addition to the abnormal\ncGMP production in the outer segment, would lead to aberrant\ncGMP production in the inner segment and aggravate the pro-\ngression of the G86R GCAP1-produced retinopathy.\nExperimental procedures\nClinical studies\nHuman studies—A family with a multigeneration history of\nvisual loss suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance was\nstudied. The proband was examined with clinical, electrophysi-\nological, psychophysical, and imaging tests, and records were\nobtained from other affected members. Informed consent was\nobtained and procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki\nguidelines and were approved by the institutional review board.\nElectroretinography (ERG)—Rod, mixed rod-cone, and cone\nfull-field ERGs were performed according to published proto-\ncols (72). In brief, bipolar Burian-Allen contact lens electrodes\nwere used with an Espion system (Diagnosys, Lowell, MA).\nUnder dark-adapted conditions, rod photoreceptor driven\nfunction was probed with dim blue \t1.6 log scot-cd s m\t2\nflashes, and combined output of rod and cone photoreceptors\nwas probed with white \u00021.2 log scot-cd s m\t2 flashes. Under\nlight-adapted conditions, cone photoreceptor function was iso-\nlated with white 0.8 log phot-cd s m\t2 flashes at stimulation\nrates of 1 and 30 Hz using white adapting backgrounds of 1.5\nand 0.8 log phot-cd m\t2, respectively.\nPsychophysical testing—Kinetic visual fields were performed\nwith a Goldmann perimeter using two target sizes (V-4e, 1.72°\nand I-4e, 0.11°).\nImaging—En face images were obtained using a confocal\nscanning laser ophthalmoscope (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg\nEngineering, Heidelberg, Germany) to determine RPE integ-\nrity. Near-IR reduced-illuminance autofluorescence images\n(NIR-RAFI)\nand\nshort-wavelength\nreduced-illuminance\nautofluorescence imaging (SW-RAFI) were acquired using\nmethods previously reported (73, 74). For NIR-RAFI acquisi-\ntion, excitation was with 790-nm NIR light (100% laser power)\nand the detector sensitivity was held invariant at 105%; for SW-\nRAFI, excitation at 488 nm was used at 25% laser power and\n105% detector sensitivity. The automatic normalization feature\nwas turned off and imaging was obtained using the automatic\nreal time feature, which averages multiple frames to improve\nthe signal to noise ratio. Cross-sectional retinal imaging was\nperformed with optical coherence tomography (RTVue-100;\nOptovue Inc., Fremont, CA, and ultrahigh resolution SDOCT\nBi-\u0002; Kowa Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Overlapping hori-\nzontal line scans were used to create a profile along the hori-\nzontal meridian covering eccentricities up to 30o in temporal\nand nasal directions. Segmentation analysis was performed\nusing custom programs (Matlab 9.1; MathWork, Natick, MA)\nbased on signal feature assignments as previously published\n(75).\nGCAP1 expression and purification\nTwo orthologs of myristoylated GCAP1 for biochemical and\nTrp fluorescence analysis, a bovine (D6S variant) and a human\n(E6S variant), were expressed from pET11d vector (Novagen/\nCalbiochem) in a BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain\n(Novagen/Calbiochem) harboring a pBB131 plasmid coding for\nyeast N-myristoyltransferase and purified using previously\npublished procedures (51) modified as follows. Cells were typ-\nically grown in 2.0 liters of a standard LB medium (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) containing 50 \u0002g/ml of kanamycin and 100\n\u0002g/ml of ampicillin to reach A600 0.6–0.7. Free myristic acid\n(Sigma) was added from a concentrated ethanol solution to the\nsuspension of bacterial cells to a final concentration of 100\n\u0002g/ml, 30 min prior to the induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl\n\u0004-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Research Products International).\nThree hours after the induction, the bacterial pellet was har-\nvested by centrifugation at 8,000 \n g for 20 min at 4 °C and\nfrozen in \t70 °C. The thawed pellet was resuspended in 100 ml\nof 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mM EGTA and 14 mM\n2-mercaptoethanol, and the cells were disrupted by ultrasoni-\ncation. The expressed GCAP1 in the insoluble fraction of the\ninclusion bodies was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 \n g\nfor 20 min, 4 °C, extracted from the pellet by homogenization in\n30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mM EGTA, 14 mM\n2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MgCl2, and 8 M Sigma Ultra urea for\n30 min at 4 °C, and first dialyzed at 4 °C for 3–4 h against 2.0\nliters of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mM\nEGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and then\novernight against 2.0 liters of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5)\ncontaining 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 14 mM 2-mercap-\ntoethanol. The insoluble material was removed by centrifuga-\ntion at 20,000 \n g for 20 min, 4 °C. The concentration of Tris-\nHCl buffer (pH 7.5) in the supernatant was adjusted to 50 mM\nand CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and kept\nfor 20 min at room temperature. The precipitate was removed\nby centrifugation at 20,000 \n g for 20 min, 4 °C. Supernatant\nwas collected and, after adding NaCl to 1 M and DTT to 5 mM,\napplied on a 1.6 \n 5.0-cm butyl-Sepharose Fast Flow column\n(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH\n7.5) containing 1.0 M NaCl. The column was washed with \u000710\nvolumes of the same buffer and GCAP1 was eluted with 5 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 5 ml using a Amicon\nUltra-15 (10,000 MWCO) centrifugal filter (Thermo Fisher Sci-\nentific). Concentrated solution was centrifuged at 200,000 \n g\nfor 10 min, 4 °C, in a Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge and\nchromatographed on a GE Healthcare Sephacryl S-100 column\n(2.6 \n 60 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),\n100 mM NaCl. The main peak containing GCAP1 was collected\nand EDTA was added to 2 mM to remove Ca2\u0002 bound to\nGCAP1. We observed that using Chelex resin was not sufficient\nto remove all bound Ca2\u0002 from GCAP1, whereas preincubation\nwith EDTA yielded metal-free GCAP1. The excess EDTA was\nthen removed by 4 cycles of 20-fold concentration/dilution in\n10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 30 \u0002M EDTA using Ami-\ncon Ultra-15 (10,000 MWCO) centrifugal filter. We observed\nthat even in solutions prepared using reagents containing \u00065\nppb Ca2\u0002 and 18 megohms cm water, Ca2\u0002 contaminations\ncould reach as high as 1 \u0002M. Because GCAP1 has high affinity\nfor Ca2\u0002, even these low levels of contamination are sufficient\nto skew measurement of the Ca2\u0002 binding. Hence, the 30 \u0002M\nEDTA was used to prevent GCAP1 from rebinding Ca2\u0002 from\nthe solutions during the concentration/dilution cycles. The\ncGMP synthesis and photoreceptor blindness\n3484\nJ.

Concentrated pro-\ntein was frozen in small aliquots and stored at \t70 °C. The\npurity of GCAP1 preparations estimated by SDS gel electro-\nphoresis was \u000595%.\nRetGC1 expression and activity assay\nHuman recombinant RetGC1 was expressed from a modified\nInvitrogen pRCCMV vector in HEK293 cells transfected using\na calcium-phosphate precipitation method and the membrane\nfraction containing the expressed cyclase was purified as previ-\nously described (48). The guanylyl cyclase activity was assayed\nas previously described in detail (48, 56). Briefly, the assay mix-\nture (25 \u0002l) containing HEK293 membranes, 30 mM MOPS-\nKOH (pH 7.2), 60 mM KCl, 4 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM\nCa2\u0002/Mg2\u0002/EGTA buffers, 0.9 mM free Mg2\u0002, 0.3 mM ATP, 4\nmM cGMP, 1 mM GTP, and 1 \u0002Ci of [\u0003-32P]GTP, 100 \u0002M zapri-\nnast and dipyridamole, and 10 mM creatine phosphate, 0.5 unit\nof creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) was incubated at 30 °C for\n30 min and the reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at\n95 °C for 2 min. The resultant [32P]cGMP product was sepa-\nrated by TLC using fluorescently-backed polyethyleneimine-\ncellulose plates (Merck) developed in 0.2 M LiCl, eluted with 2 M\nLiCl, and the radioactivity was counted using liquid scintilla-\ntion.

Data fit and statistical analysis\n(Student’s t test) was performed using Synergy Kaleidagraph\nsoftware.\nProtein fluorescence spectroscopy\nThe intrinsic Trp fluorescence of GCAP1 was assayed as pre-\nviously described in detail (51). In brief, a 332-nm Trp fluores-\ncence emission intensity of GCAP1 in solution containing 100\nmM MOPS/KOH (pH 7.2), 40 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and spec-\nified concentrations of MgCl2 was recorded at 23 °C (\u0006ex \u0005 290\nnm). Small aliquots of concentrated CaCl2 were added to obtain\nthe required free Ca2\u0002 concentrations calculated according to\nthe method of Brooks and Stoney (78), utilizing the algorithm\nof Marks and Maxfield (79). Data fit and statistical analysis\n(Student’s t test) was performed using Synergy Kaleidagraph\nsoftware.\nGCAP1 mutagenesis\nThe mutations were introduced into GCAP1 cDNA by PCR\nfollowing conventional “splicing-by-overlap extension” proce-\ndure utilizing a high-fidelity Thermo Scientific PhusionFlash\npolymerase. The mutated cDNA was inserted into the NcoI/\nBamHI sites of a pET11d vector, downstream from T7 pro-\nmoter, as described previously (46) and verified by automated\nSanger sequencing.\nRD3 expression and purification\nRecombinant human RD3 was expressed from a pET11d vec-\ntor in a BL21(DE3)Codon Plus E. coli strain (Stratagene/Agilent\nTechnologies) induced by isopropyl \u0004-D-thiogalactopyrano-\nside, extracted from the inclusion bodies and purified by salt\nprecipitation and dialysis as previously described in detail\n(55, 56).\nITC experiments\nITC experiments with hGCAP1 and G86R mutant were per-\nformed on a VP-ITC from MicroCal (Northhampton, MA).\nBriefly, purified myristoylated calcium-free (no EGTA) WT\nGCAP1 and G86R mutant were present in the recording cell in\ntitration buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 60 mM KCl, 4 mM NaCl)\nat 24 \u0002M and were titrated with 5 \u0002l of 0.5 mM CaCl2 stock\nsolution at T \u0005 25 °C (50 injections, each 5-\u0002l). The titration\nbuffer was decalcified using a self-packed gravity flow Chelex\n100 column (Bio-Rad). The remaining Ca2\u0002 concentration was\ndetermined by a BAPTA absorbance assay and was found to\nrange between 90 nM in the presence of 24 \u0002M WT and 200 nM\nin the presence of 30 \u0002M G86R mutant (no EGTA used). All\nbuffers were filtered (0.22 \u0002m) and degassed twice immediately\nbefore use. Three independent repetitions were made for each\ntitration set. Protein samples for each repetition were obtained\nfrom two to three separate expressions and three separate puri-\nfication performances. Reference injections of Ca2\u0002 into decal-\ncified buffer were performed without any protein, and the ref-\nerence was subtracted in each experiment. Each titration was\nanalyzed by applying a model implemented in the Origin soft-\nware (MicroCal) assuming two Ca2\u0002-binding sites, or two\nMg2\u0002-binding sites. The best fitting results were used to obtain\ndissociation constants KD,app and enthalpy changes (\u000bH).\nAuthor contributions—I.V.P., A.V.C., A.Sumaroka, E.V.O., A.Schol-\nten, K.-W. K., and S.

However, the molecular regulation\nof ERK3 functions in cancer cells is largely unknown. ERK3 has\na single phospho-acceptor site (Ser189) in its activation motif\nrather than the TXY conserved in conventional MAPKs such as\nERK1/2. Although dual phosphorylation of the TXY motif is\nknown to be critical for the activation of conventional MAPKs,\nthe role of Ser189 phosphorylation in ERK3 activity and its func-\ntion in cancer cells remain elusive. In this study, we revealed that\nactivation loop phosphorylation is important for ERK3 in pro-\nmoting cancer cell invasiveness, as the S189A mutation greatly\ndecreased the ability of ERK3 to promote migration and inva-\nsion of lung cancer cells. Interestingly, a catalytically inactive\nERK3 mutant was still capable of increasing migration and inva-\nsion, although to a lesser extent compared with WT ERK3, sug-\ngesting that ERK3 promotes cancer cell invasiveness by both\nkinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. To\nelucidate how the S189A mutation reduces the invasiveness-\npromoting ability of ERK3, we tested its effect on the kinase\nactivity of ERK3 toward steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3), a\nrecently identified substrate of ERK3 critical for cancer cell\ninvasiveness. Compared with ERK3, ERK3-S189A exhibited a\ndramatic decrease in kinase activity toward SRC3 and a concom-\nitantly reduced ability to stimulate matrix metalloproteinase\nexpression. Taken together, our study unravels the importance\nof Ser189 phosphorylation for intramolecular regulation of\nERK3 kinase activity and invasiveness-promoting ability in lung\ncancer cells.\nMitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)2 are Ser/Thr\nkinases that play important roles in signal transduction. They\nare classified into conventional MAPKs, such as extracellular\nsignal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 isoforms (\u0002, \u0003, \u0004,\nand \u0005), and atypical MAPKs, such as ERK3 and ERK4. The con-\nventional MAPKs have a highly conserved Thr-XAA-Tyr\n(TXY) motif in their activation loops, whose dual phosphoryla-\ntion by an upstream kinase results in a dramatic increase in\nkinase activity and translocation into the nucleus (1, 2). Unlike\nthe conventional MAPKs, ERK3 has a single phospho-acceptor\nsite, Ser189, in its SEG activation motif. ERK3-Ser189 is consti-\ntutively phosphorylated in resting cells and is not affected by\ncommon cell stimuli (3). In addition, the subcellular distribu-\ntion of ERK3 is not affected by phosphorylation of ERK3-Ser189,\nnor in response to common mitogenic or stress stimuli, includ-\ning serum, epidermal growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid,\narsenite, and hydrogen peroxide (4–6). ERK3-Ser189 phosphor-\nylation can occur in cis as a result of autophosphorylation (4, 7)\nor in trans by the group I p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs)\n(8, 9). The phosphorylation of ERK3-Ser189 is reduced by dual-\nspecificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2) (10).\nThe atypical MAPK ERK3 has important physiological func-\ntions, including pulmonary differentiation, T cell activation,\nand angiogenesis (11–13). Recently, the role of ERK3 signaling\nin cancer has been a subject of significant interest. ERK3\nincreases the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells both in\nvitro and in vivo (14). The underlying molecular mechanism\ninvolves phosphorylation of steroid receptor coactivator 3\n(SRC3) at Ser857 by ERK3 (14). SRC3 is overexpressed in several\ntypes of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and pros-\ntate cancer (15), and is considered a bona fide oncogene, as it\npromotes cell proliferation and transformation, cancer cell\nmigration and invasion, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis\nin mice (16–18). Phosphorylation of SRC3-Ser857 by ERK3\nincreases the interaction of SRC3 with the transcription factor\nPEA3 and subsequently leads to the up-regulation of matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes critical for cell invasion\nby degrading the extracellular matrix (14). Similar to its role in\nlung cancer cells, ERK3 promotes the migration of breast can-\ncer cells by regulating cell morphology and spreading (19). Fur-\nthermore, ERK3 increases the chemoresistance of lung cancer\ncells to topoisomerase II inhibitors (20). Several mutations (or\nvariants) of ERK3 have been found in cancers, including ERK3-\nL290P and ERK3-L290V, which were found to confer ERK3 an\nThis work was supported by a start-up fund of Wright State University and\nNCI, National Institutes of Health grant 1R01CA193264-01 (to W.

In line with its role in promoting the migration and\ninvasion of lung cancer and breast cancer cells, the expression\nlevel of ERK3 is up-regulated in multiple types of cancers,\nincluding lung cancer, gastric cancer, and oral squamous cell\ncarcinoma (14, 22–24).\nIn contrast to conventional MAPKs, for which a large num-\nber of substrates have been identified, ERK3 has a very\nrestricted substrate specificity, and it does not phosphorylate\nmany generic MAPK substrates in vitro, including c-Jun, Tal1,\nMyoD, c-Elk, and papilloma virus protein E7 (4, 7). A well-\ncharacterized substrate of ERK3 is MAPK-activated protein\nkinase 5 (MK5) (6, 25). ERK3 phosphorylates MK5 at Thr182,\nleading to MK5 activation (6, 25). MK5 activation by ERK3 is\nregularly determined in a coupled kinase assay by measuring\nthe phosphorylation of MK5 peptide substrate or its protein\nsubstrates Hsp27 or Hsp25 in the presence of both ERK3 and\nMK5 kinases (3, 6, 25). Importantly, substrate phosphorylation\nby MK5 was greatly reduced when incubated with the ERK3-\nS189A mutant compared with that in the presence of WT\nERK3, suggesting that the Ser189 phospho-site is important for\nERK3 to activate MK5 (3). It remains to be further elucidated,\nhowever, whether Ser189 phosphorylation has a direct regula-\ntion on ERK3 enzymatic activity per se, given that Ser189 is\nrequired for ERK3 to bind to the substrate MK5 (3, 8). With\nrecent identification of additional ERK3 substrates, including\nSRC3, it would be interesting to determine whether the Ser189\nphospho-site is only involved in substrate binding or also\ndirectly regulates the catalytic activity of ERK3. In addition, it is\nunclear whether ERK3-Ser189 phosphorylation is required for\nthe migration/invasion-promoting function of ERK3 in cancer\ncells.\nIn this study, we investigated the importance of Ser189 phos-\nphorylation for ERK3 in promoting cancer cell migration and\ninvasion as well as its role in regulating the catalytic activity of\nERK3 by directly measuring phosphorylation of the substrates\nin an in vitro kinase assay. We found that the S189A mutation\nsignificantly reduced the ability of ERK3 to promote lung can-\ncer cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, the kinase-inac-\ntive ERK3 mutant was still capable of significantly promoting\ncell migration and invasion, although the promoting effect was\nsignificantly reduced compared with WT ERK3, suggesting\nthat ERK3 promotes cell migration and invasion in both kinase-\ndependent and kinase-independent manners. The in vitro\nkinase activity of ERK3 and ERK3-S189A was compared using\nproteins purified from bacteria or mammalian cells. Interest-\ningly, bacterially expressed recombinant ERK3 and ERK3-\nS189A proteins showed low but equivalent kinase activity.\nHowever, when ERK3 proteins were expressed and purified\nfrom 293T mammalian cells, S189A mutation led to a great\ndecrease in the kinase activity of ERK3 toward substrates,\nincluding SRC3 and myelin basic protein (MBP). Intriguingly,\nthe S189A mutation does not seem to affect the interaction\nbetween ERK3 and SRC3. Consistent with its effect in decreas-\ning the ability of ERK3 to promote cell invasiveness, the S189A\nmutation significantly diminished the ability of ERK3 to up-\nregulate the levels of MMP9 and MMP10. Our study demon-\nstrates the importance of activation loop phosphorylation in\nregulating the kinase activity and cellular functions of ERK3.\nResults\nActivation loop phosphorylation is important for the\nmigration-promoting ability of ERK3 in lung cancer cells\nRecent studies have revealed that ERK3 increases the migra-\ntion of lung cancer and breast cancer cells (14, 19). However,\nthe role of ERK3 activation loop phosphorylation in this process\nis unclear. Hence, we investigated the effect of mutating the\nactivation loop phosphorylation site on the ability of ERK3 to\npromote cancer cell migration. As expected, overexpression of\nERK3 with an HA tag by transient lentiviral transduction sig-\nnificantly increased the migration of A549 lung cancer cells\n(Fig. 1, A and B). The kinase-dead (KD) mutant (ERK3-KD)\ndefective in ATP binding showed a much reduced ability to\npromote the migration of A549 cells. Importantly, similar to the\neffect of ERK3-KD, the ERK3-S189A mutant had a dramatic\ndecrease in the ability to promote migration of A549 cells com-\npared with that of WT ERK3. However, overexpression of\nERK3-S189D, a potential phosphomimic of ERK3 at Ser189,\nincreased the migration of A549 cells at a similar level as that by\nERK3 (Fig. 1, A and B). In line with these results obtained by\ntransiently overexpressing HA-ERK3, stable overexpression of\nmyc-tagged ERK3 by lentiviral transduction significantly\nincreased the migration of A549 cells, whereas the myc-ERK3-\nS189A and myc-ERK3-KD mutants had a significantly reduced\nability to promote migration compared with myc-ERK3 (Fig. 1,\nC and D). Similar results were obtained in another lung cancer\ncell line, H1299. Although transient overexpression of HA-\nERK3 increased the migration of H1299 cells, both the S189A\nand KD mutants showed a decrease in the number of migrated\ncells compared with that of ERK3 (Fig. 1, E and F).\nNext, to further confirm the importance of Ser189 phosphor-\nylation and the kinase activity of ERK3 in promoting cancer cell\nmigration, we generated H1299 cells with stable depletion of\nendogenous ERK3 using an shRNA that targets the 3\u0002 UTR of\nERK3 mRNA (Fig. 2A), followed by re-expression of WT ERK3,\nERK3-S189A, or ERK3-KD (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our pre-\nvious finding (14), stable knockdown of ERK3 greatly reduced\nthe migration ability of H1299 cells (Fig. 2B). Importantly, re-\nexpression of WT ERK3 rescued the migration ability of\nH1299-shERK3 cells (Fig. 2D, compare WT ERK3 with the\nempty vector control). Similar to their effects in parental H1299\ncells, overexpression of ERK3-S189A or ERK3-KD had a signif-\nicantly reduced ability to stimulate migration of H1299-\nshERK3 cells compared with that of WT ERK3 (Fig. 2D).\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that both activation\nloop phosphorylation and kinase activity are important for\nERK3 to promote lung cancer cell migration. Notably, in the\nexperiments described above, although migration induced by\nthe ERK3-KD mutant was significantly less than that of WT\nERK3, ERK3-KD still significantly increased cancer cell migra-\ntion compared with the empty vector control, suggesting that\nERK3 may have a kinase-independent role in promoting cancer\ncell migration.\nRole of phospho-ERK3-Ser189 in cancer cell invasiveness\n16194\nJ.

A and B, A549 cells were\ntransiently transduced with lentiviruses expressing an empty vector or HA-tagged WT or mutant ERK3 (S189A, S189D, or KD). The overexpression of ERK3 was\nverified by Western blotting using an anti-ERK3 antibody (A), and migration was assessed by Transwell cell migration assay (B). C and D, A549 cells were stably\ntransduced with lentiviruses expressing an empty vector, myc-ERK3, myc-ERK3-S189A, or myc-ERK3-KD. Overexpression of myc-ERK3 proteins in stable cell\nlines was verified by Western blotting using anti-ERK3 antibody (C). Phospho-ERK3 (Ser189) was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of ERK3 using an ERK3 Ab,\nfollowed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-ERK3 (Ser189) antibody. In both the ERK3 and pERK3 (Ser189) immunoblots, the lower bands represent\nendogenous ERK3 (or endogenous phospho-ERK3-Ser189), whereas the higher bands represent the overexpressed myc6-tagged ERK3 (or phospho-\nmyc6-ERK3-Ser189) proteins.

Hence, we compared the invasion ability of\nA549 lung cancer cells that have stable overexpression of either\nERK3-S189A or ERK3-KD with that of A549 cells with stable\noverexpression of WT ERK3. As expected, A549 cells with sta-\nble overexpression of myc-ERK3 showed a significant increase\nin invasion compared with cells expressing an empty control\nvector. On the other hand, compared with cells with overex-\npression of ERK3, A549 cells with stable overexpression of\nERK3-S189A or ERK3-KD showed a significant reduction in\ninvasion ability (Fig. 3A). Similarly, overexpression of HA-\nERK3 significantly increased the invasion of H1299 cells,\nwhereas ERK3-S189A or ERK3-KD mutants had significantly\ndecreased invasion-promoting ability compared with WT\nERK3 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, similar to its role in promoting\ncancer cell migration, the ERK3-KD mutant significantly\nincreased the invasion of both A549 and H1299 cells compared\nwith that of cells expressing the empty vector control, suggest-\ning that ERK3 promotes cancer cell invasion in both kinase-de-\npendent and kinase-independent manners. Taken together,\nthese results demonstrate the importance of activation loop\nphosphorylation and catalytic activity in the ability of ERK3 to\npromote lung cancer cell invasion.\nOverexpression of WT or mutant ERK3 does not affect lung\ncancer cell proliferation\nThe role of ERK3 in cancer cell proliferation remains elusive.\nAlthough some studies showed that ERK3 negatively regulated\ncell cycle progression in fibroblasts, squamous cell carcinoma,\nand hepatocarcinoma lines (5, 26, 27), another study showed\nthat knockdown of ERK3 has little effect on lung cancer cell\nproliferation (14). Hence, we wanted to clarify the role of ERK3\nin lung cancer cell growth by determining the effects of overex-\npression of either WT ERK3 or each of the ERK3 mutants in\nlung cancer cell proliferation. In A549 cells, stable overexpres-\nsion of myc-ERK3 showed no significant effect on cell prolifer-\nation compared with the empty vector control. In addition, cells\nwith stable overexpression of ERK3-S189A or ERK3-KD\nmutants proliferated at a similar rate (Fig. 4A). Similarly, stable\noverexpression of HA-ERK3 did not significantly change\nH1299 cell proliferation compared with the empty vector control;\nneither did the ERK3-S189A, ERK3-S189D, or ERK3-KD mutants\n(Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, we conclude that, although ERK3 has\nan important role in promoting lung cancer cell migration and\ninvasion, it does not affect lung cancer cell proliferation.\nFigure 2.

(2018) 293(42) 16193–16205\n\nMutation of the phosphorylation site in the activation motif\ndoes not affect the in vitro kinase activity of bacterially\nexpressed ERK3\nSer189 phosphorylation has been shown to be important for\nERK3 in activating MK5 (3). It remains to be further elucidated,\nhowever, whether Ser189 phosphorylation directly regulates\nERK3 enzymatic activity per se, given that Ser189 is required for\nERK3 to bind to the substrate MK5 (3, 8). To further elucidate\nthis, we expressed and purified recombinant WT or mutant\nERK3 proteins from bacteria and compared their kinase activ-\nities in vitro.\nFirst, we expressed and purified the kinase domain of ERK3\nalone, which lies within the first 340 amino acids of ERK3.\nHis-tagged ERK3(1–340), ERK3(1–340)-S189A, and ERK3(1–\n340)-KD recombinant proteins were expressed and purified\nwith a high purity and yield (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis of\nthe purified recombinant proteins confirmed the expression of\nthe proteins and the phosphorylation of ERK3(1–340) at Ser189\n(Fig. 5B). However, the level of Ser189 phosphorylation of\nERK3(1–340) expressed in bacteria was much lower than that\nof ERK3(1–340) protein expressed and immunoprecipitated\nfrom 293T mammalian cells (Fig. 5C). Predictably, the bacteri-\nallyexpressedERK3(1–340)-S189Amutantdidnotdisplayphos-\nphorylation at Ser189; neither did ERK3(1–340)-KD (Fig. 5B).\nThe kinase activity of the purified recombinant ERK3(1–340)\nproteins was then analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay using\nMBP as the substrate in the presence of [\u0004-32P]ATP (Fig. 5D).\nERK3(1–340) was catalytically active, as shown by increasing\nphosphorylation of the substrate MBP and increasing ERK3\nautophosphorylation with increasing reaction time. As antici-\npated, the ERK3(1–340)-KD mutant, which served as a negative\ncontrol for the kinase assay, neither phosphorylated MBP nor\nwas autophosphorylated. Interestingly, bacterially expressed\nERK3(1–340)-S189A was as active as its WT counterpart, as\ndemonstrated by phosphorylation of the substrate MBP and its\nautophosphorylation. These data demonstrate that the activity\nof the bacterially expressed ERK3 kinase domain is not affected\nby activation loop phosphorylation.\nNext we attempted to express and purify full-length ERK3\nfrom bacteria. Full-length WT or mutant ERK3 recombinant\nproteins with an N-terminal His6 tag and a C-terminal GST tag\nwere purified, albeit at a lower yield because of marked degra-\ndation, which could be expected for larger proteins such as\nERK3 (Fig. 5, E and F). The in vitro kinase activity of these\nbacterially expressed full-length ERK3 proteins toward known\nERK3 substrates was barely detectable (data not shown).\nBecause bacteria do not endogenously express ERK3 or its\nupstream kinase, the phosphorylation of bacterially expressed\nERK3 in an in vitro kinase assay is deduced to be mainly cata-\nlyzed by ERK3 itself and can represent ERK3 activity. Hence, an\nin vitro kinase assay was performed to compare the autophos-\nphorylation of WT ERK3 protein with that of Ser189 mutant\nproteins (Fig. 5G). Autophosphorylation was detected for ERK3\nbut not for the ERK3-KD mutant. Similar to the results of the\nassays of purified kinase domain of ERK3, mutation of Ser189 to\nalanine or aspartate did not change the autophosphorylation of\nfull-length ERK3. This suggests that mutation of Ser189 in the\nactivation loop does not affect the enzymatic activity of bacte-\nrially expressed ERK3 and that the Ser189 residue is not the\nmain autophosphorylation site under these conditions.\nActivation loop phosphorylation is important for in vitro\nenzymatic activity of ERK3 immunoprecipitated from\nmammalian cells\nRecombinant protein kinases expressed in bacteria display\nminimal posttranslational modifications, including phosphor-\nylation (28). On the contrary, protein kinases expressed in\nmammalian cells are subjected to a greater extent of posttrans-\nlational modifications that likely regulate their kinase activity.\nHence, we decided to examine the importance of Ser189 phos-\nFigure 3.

(2018) 293(42) 16193–16205 16197\n\nphorylation in the kinase activity of ERK3 by expressing and\nimmunoprecipitating WT and mutant ERK3 proteins from\nmammalian cells. HA-tagged ERK3 proteins were expressed\nand immunoprecipitated from 293T cells using HA antibody\n(Ab)-conjugated agarose beads, followed by elution of the pro-\nteins off the beads using HA peptide. Analysis by SDS-PAGE\nshowed that ERK3 proteins migrated on the gels at the expected\nmolecular mass of nearly 100 kDa and were immunoreactive to\nanti-ERK3 antibody (Fig. 6, A and B). Immunoblotting with an\nantibody specific for pERK3 (Ser189) revealed that ERK3, but\nnot the S189A mutant, is phosphorylated on the Ser189 residue\nin 293T cells. As Ser189 can be phosphorylated by other\nkinase(s), such as PAKs, in mammalian cells, ERK3-KD still had\na detectable level of phosphorylation at Ser189, although it was\nmuch lower than that of WT ERK3 (Fig. 6B).\nFollowing the successful purification of WT and mutant\nERK3 proteins from 293T cells, an in vitro kinase assay was\nperformed to compare their kinase activities using MBP or a\nfragment of SRC3 as a substrate. Previous work showed that\nERK3 phosphorylates SRC3 on the Ser189 residue, which locates\nwithin the CBP-interacting domain (CID) (14). Hence, we used\nGST-tagged SRC3-CID as a substrate. Consistent with previous\nstudies, ERK3 efficiently phosphorylated both MBP and SRC3,\nwhereas ERK3-KD showed much reduced activity of phosphor-\nylating these substrates (Fig. 6, C and D). The weak but detect-\nable phosphorylation of substrates by ERK3-KD could be\nattributed to its weak residual activity and/or the presence of\nminimal amounts of other kinases in the immunoprecipitates.\nInterestingly, although mutation of S189A did not affect the\nkinase activity of bacterially expressed ERK3 (Fig. 5, D and G),\nERK3-S189A protein purified from 293T cells, compared with\nERK3, had greatly decreased kinase activity toward the sub-\nstrates MBP and SRC3 and also toward itself (autophosphory-\nlation) (Fig. 6, C and D). Notably, ERK3 expressed in 293T cells\nwas highly phosphorylated at Ser189, whereas Ser189 phosphor-\nylation of ERK3 expressed in bacteria was undetectable (Fig.\n6E). In line with the levels of Ser189 phosphorylation, ERK3\nexpressed in 293T cells (100 ng per reaction) readily phosphor-\nylated MBP and SRC3-CID (Fig. 6, C and 6D), whereas ERK3\nexpressed in bacteria at an even higher amount (350 ng/reac-\ntion) did not exhibit detectable activity toward MBP or SRC-3-\nCID (data not shown). When expressed in bacteria, ERK3 has\nlow or undetectable level of Ser189 phosphorylation and low\nkinase activity; hence, mutation of Ser189 to alanine had little\neffect on the kinase activity of ERK3. Taken together, these\nresults suggest that Ser189 phosphorylation is critical for the\nkinase activity of ERK3.\nPrevious studies showed that Ser189 phosphorylation is nec-\nessary for the binding of ERK3 to MK5 (3, 8). To test whether\nSer189 phosphorylation is similarly important for the binding of\nERK3 to its substrate SRC3, we examined the interactions of\nERK3 or ERK3-S189A mutant with SRC3 by performing a co-\nimmunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 6F). 293T cells were co-\ntransfected with the FLAG-SRC3 plasmid in addition to an\nFigure 4.

Hence, we compared the effects of overexpression of\nERK3 versus ERK3-S189A on MMP9 and MMP10 gene expres-\nsion in lung cancer cells. In line with previous findings, over-\nexpression of ERK3 increased MMP9 and MMP10 gene\nexpression in A549 cells. Importantly, the S189A mutation\nsignificantly decreased the ability of ERK3 to up-regulate both\nMMP10 and MMP9 (compare ERK3-S189A versus ERK3 in Fig.\n7, A and B, respectively). Although the MMP10 mRNA level\nwas significantly lower in cells with ERK3-KD expression versus\nthose with ERK3 expression, ERK3-KD and ERK3 showed a\nsimilar ability to up-regulate the MMP9 mRNA level (Fig. 7, A\nandB),suggestingthatup-regulationofMMP9byERK3isinde-\npendent of its kinase activity.\nDiscussion\nProtein kinases are involved in a myriad of cellular processes\nand signaling pathways; hence, they are typically under tight\ncontrol. There are various mechanisms that regulate the activ-\nity of kinases, including posttranslational modifications, phys-\nical interactions with inhibitory or activating protein partners,\nand changes in cellular localization that alter the availability of\nsubstrates and activators (29). The activity of the conventional\nMAPKs such as ERK1/2 is tightly regulated by dual phosphor-\nylation of the TXY motif in their activation loop. In response to\nextracellular signals, MAPK kinases phosphorylate conven-\ntional MAPKs on threonine and tyrosine residues in the activa-\ntion loop, resulting in increased activity and nuclear transloca-\ntion (2). On the other hand, the regulation of the enzymatic\nactivity of the atypical MAPK ERK3 is currently poorly under-\nstood. ERK3 has a single phospho-acceptor site (Ser189) in its\nSEGmotifintheactivationloopthatisconstitutivelyphosphor-\nylated in resting mammalian cells and not affected by many\nknown cell stimuli (3). Also, Ser189 phosphorylation does not\nalter the subcellular localization of ERK3 in the nucleus (5).\nAlthough Ser189 is known to be important for the binding of\nERK3 to MK5 and the subsequent activation of MK5 by ERK3\n(3), it remains to be further elucidated whether Ser189 directly\nregulates the kinase activity of ERK3. Recent studies have dem-\nonstrated an important role for ERK3 in promoting cancer cell\nmigration and invasion, but it is unclear whether Ser189 phos-\nphorylation regulates the functions of ERK3 in cancer cells.\nThis work clearly demonstrates that activation loop phos-\nphorylation is important for the ability of ERK3 to promote the\nmigration and invasion of lung cancer cells. This can be attrib-\nuted to multiple mechanisms. First, it is due to its importance\nfor kinase activity, as demonstrated by the great reduction in\nkinase activity by S189A mutation in ERK3 expressed and puri-\nfied from mammalian cells. SRC3 is a substrate of ERK3 and has\nbeen shown to be an important downstream mediator of ERK3\nfunction in cancer cells. Phosphorylation of SRC3 by ERK3\nleads to up-regulation of MMPs, increasing the invasion of can-\ncer cells (14). Consistently, we found that, compared with\nERK3, both ERK3-S189A and a catalytically inactive ERK3-KD\nmutant had significantly decreased abilities to up-regulate\nMMP10 gene expression and to promote cancer cell invasion.\nAlso, Ser189 phosphorylation might be important for kinase-\nindependent role of ERK3 in promoting cancer cell invasive-\nness, given that ERK3-S189A had decreased ability to up-regu-\nlate MMP9 gene expression, whereas ERK3-KD showed ability\nequivalent to that of ERK3. The kinase-independent mecha-\nnism by which ERK3 increases MMP9 expression and cell inva-\nsiveness remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, a recent study\nrevealed the presence of ERK3, but not ERK3-S189A, in the cell\nmembranes of breast cancer cells (19). Because the membrane\nlocalization of ERK3 is potentially important for its ability to\ninduce morphological changes and enhance cell motility (19),\nthis may be another mechanism underlying our finding that\nSer189 phosphorylation is important for cancer cell migration.\nFurther studies are needed to elucidate how ERK3 is localized\nto the cell membrane and regulates cell morphology and\nmotility.\nImportantly, our study also reveals that ERK3 possesses a\nkinase-independent ability to promote lung cancer cell migra-\ntion and invasion. Although ERK3-KD, compared with ERK3,\ndisplayed a reduced ability to promote lung cancer cell migra-\ntion and invasion, it significantly increased both migration and\ninvasion compared with the empty vector control. Interest-\ningly, the up-regulation of MMP9 expression by ERK3-KD is\nequivalent to that by WT ERK3, which can be one of the mech-\nanisms underlying the kinase-independent role of ERK3 in pro-\nmoting cancer cell invasion. In fact, a kinase-independent role\nfor ERK3 in regulating the morphology of breast cancer cells\nwas noted in another study; a catalytically inactive mutant of\nERK3 decreased the breast cancer cell spread area comparably\nwith the effect of WT ERK3 (19). In contrast, the catalytic activ-\nity of ERK3 is required for the survival and proper differentia-\ntion of T cells in the thymus, as knock-in of the ERK3-KD allele\nrecapitulated the phenotype in T cell survival observed in mice\nwith ERK3 deficiency (30). The elucidation of catalytic versus\nnoncatalytic functions of ERK3 would entail greater knowledge\nabout the substrates and the interacting partners of ERK3 in\ndifferent cellular contexts.\nConsistent with previously published work demonstrating\nthat knockdown of ERK3 did not affect lung cancer cell prolif-\neration, we found in this study that lung cancer cell prolifera-\nFigure 7.

Biol. Chem.

However, some studies have shown\nan inhibitory role for ERK3 in the proliferation of fibroblasts,\nsquamous carcinoma cells, and hepatocarcinoma cells (5, 26,\n27, 31). On the other hand, some studies have demonstrated\nthat ERK3 promotes proliferation of endothelial cells and T\ncells (12, 13). Taken together, these findings suggest that ERK3\nhas a differential role in cell proliferation depending on cell\ntype.\nIn this study, we also attempted to address a gap in the cur-\nrent understanding of the regulation of the kinase activity of\nERK3 by activation loop phosphorylation. Study of the mecha-\nnisms that regulate the activation of ERK3 has been hampered\nby insufficient knowledge about the structure and bona fide\nsubstrates of ERK3. Until recently, MK5 was the best-charac-\nterized downstream target of ERK3. However, the mechanism\nof MK5 activation by ERK3 is not fully understood, and debates\nremain whether ERK3 directly phosphorylates MK5 or only\nenhances its autophosphorylation (6, 25). Mutation of ERK3-\nS189 to alanine abolishes the interaction between ERK3 and\nMK5 and, hence, decreases ERK3-mediated MK5 activation\n(3). However, it is unclear whether Ser189 phosphorylation\ndirectly regulates the catalytic activity of ERK3 and whether\nSer189 is important for the binding of ERK3 to other substrates.\nTo address these questions, we first expressed and purified the\nfull length or the kinase domain alone of ERK3 proteins with or\nwithout mutations of Ser189 from bacteria. Intriguingly, muta-\ntion of Ser189 to the nonphosphorylatable alanine in either the\nfull-length ERK3 or the kinase domain alone produced in bac-\nteria did not affect the in vitro kinase activity of ERK3. In con-\ntrast, when expressed and immunoprecipitated from mamma-\nlian cells, the kinase activity of ERK3 was almost abolished\nbecause of the S189A mutation. In addition, the S189A muta-\ntion did not affect the interaction of ERK3 with the substrate\nSRC3. Notably, the kinase activity of ERK3 purified from 293T\nmammalian cells was much higher than that of bacterially\nexpressed ERK3 protein. One possible reason for this difference\nin activity is that the phosphorylation level of ERK3 on Ser189 is\ndifferent in bacteria versus mammalian cells. Indeed, bacterially\nexpressedERK3proteinhadaverylowlevelofSer189phosphor-\nylation compared with that of ERK3 expressed in mammalian\ncells. These results suggest that bacterially expressed ERK3 pro-\ntein has low kinase activity, at least partly because of a low level\nof phosphorylation in the activation loop, whereas ERK3 pro-\ntein expressed in mammalian cells has high kinase activity, as it\nis highly phosphorylated in the activation loop. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest that Ser189 phosphorylation in the acti-\nvation loop is critical for the kinase activity of ERK3. Another\npotential mechanism underlying the regulation of the kinase\nactivity of ERK3 by Ser189 in mammalian cells is that this resi-\ndue is important for recruiting activator(s) of ERK3. ERK3 pro-\ntein expressed in bacteria, however, may lack such activator(s).\nHence, this Ser189-dependent activation mechanism for ERK3\nwould not exist in bacteria.\nTo conclude, this study provides important insights into the\nregulation of the kinase activity and cell migration/invasion-\npromoting abilities of ERK3 by activation loop phosphoryla-\ntion. In addition, we revealed a kinase-independent role for\nERK3 in promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. These\nfundamental findings provide a better understanding of the\nmolecular regulation of ERK3 activity and function in cancer\ncells, which is critical for endeavors to develop therapeutic\nagents that target ERK3 signaling in cancer. To better under-\nstand ERK3 signaling in cancer, future work is needed to further\nelucidate the interacting partners that regulate the activity and\ncellular functions of ERK3, including those that mediate its\nkinase-independent roles.\nExperimental procedures\nCell culture\nA549 and H1299 lung cancer cells were maintained in RPMI\n1640 growth medium, and 293T human embryonic kidney cells\nwere maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium.

A single col-\nony of transformed cells was inoculated in Luria broth medium\nand cultured at 37 °C overnight. Then the culture was diluted\n50-fold and allowed to grow at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6 was\nreached. Protein synthesis was induced by addition of 0.4 mM\nisopropyl \u0003-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at room temper-\nature, and then the cells were harvested and lysed using buffer A\n(20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mM KCL, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT,\n0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and Complete prote-\nase inhibitor mixture (Roche)), followed by sonication. The\nclarified lysates were then incubated with GSH-Sepharose 4B\n(GE Healthcare), and the proteins were eluted off the beads\nwith reduced GSH. For the eluted ERK3 recombinant proteins,\nan Amicon Ultra centrifugal 30-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore)\nwas used to concentrate and further purify the proteins. The\nprotein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, followed by stain-\ning with Coomassie Blue solution (InstantBlue, Expedeon).\nRecombinant MBP was a kind gift from Dr. Yong-jie Xu\n(Wright State University).\nImmunoprecipitation of ERK3 protein from mammalian cells\nWT or mutant HA-tagged ERK3 proteins were purified from\nmammalian cells as described previously (14). The appropriate\npSG5-HA-ERK3 plasmids were transfected in 293T cells. Two\ndays post-transfection, cells were lysed, and the protein lysate\nsupernatants were incubated with anti-HA affinity agarose\nbeads (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. E6779) for 3 h. After washing\nthe beads, the proteins were eluted using HA peptide (Sigma-\nAldrich). The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, fol-\nlowed by staining with Coomassie Blue solution (InstantBlue,\nExpedeon).\nIn vitro kinase assay\nEach in vitro kinase assay reaction contained ERK3 protein, a\nsubstrate, 5 \u0007Ci [\u0004-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and\n25 \u0007M cold ATP. The amounts of ERK3 and each substrate are\nindicated for each experiment. The reactions were carried out\nat 30 °C for 30 min (except for Fig. 5D) and then stopped by SDS\nsample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-\nPAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue solution, and visualized by\nautoradiography. Quantification of substrate phosphorylation\nis determined by calculating the ratio of the band intensity of\nphosphorylated substrate in the autoradiograph over that of the\ncorresponding total substrate protein in the Coomassie-stained\ngel.\nCo-immunoprecipitation\n293T cells were transfected with plasmids. Two days post-\ntransfection, the cells were lysed with EBC lysis buffer as\ndescribed under “Western blotting.” The protein lysate super-\nnatant was precleared for 1 h using protein A affinity gel beads\n(Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. P6486), and then HA-tagged ERK3\nproteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA affinity aga-\nrose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. E6779) for 3 h. After-\nward, the beads were washed, and the proteins were boiled off\nthe beads in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by\nSDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described before. 1% of the\namount of protein supernatant for immunoprecipitation was\nloaded as the input control.\nRNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR\nFor gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted from\ncells using TRIzol reagent (Ambion), and reverse transcription\nwas carried out using SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Invitro-\ngen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative\nPCR was performed using the TaqMan probe system (Roche\nDiagnostics) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 with glyceralde-\nhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control. Rel-\native expression to the normalizer sample was calculated using\nthe \b\bCT method.\nStatistics\nData are expressed as mean \u0003 S.D. or S.E., as specified in the\nfigure legends. All experiments were repeated at least three\ntimes, and a representative figure is presented. Statistical signif-\nicance was determined by two-sided Student’s t test, one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA), or two-way ANOVA, as indi-\ncated in each figure legend, and a p value of less than 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nAuthor contributions—L.

Furthermore, and perhaps most exciting, is our application of this\nmethod to bimolecular fluorescence complementation—in which two tagged proteins\ninteract—allowing the detection and localisation of protein-protein interactions in EM.\nIntroduction\nRapid and reliable protein localisation is critical for the functional characterisation of any pro-\ntein of interest (POI). Traditionally, this has been achieved through antibody-mediated meth-\nods or tagging with a fluorescent protein, such as GFP. The recent emergence of nanobodies\n(small, single-domain antibodies amenable to cellular expression) has allowed the develop-\nment of new biotechnological tools based on the detection of epitopes in living cells [1,2],\nalthough the availability of defined variable domains for antigen binding remains limiting. At\nthe same time, the use of enzymatic tags such as the soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) for\nultrastructural detection of proteins provides an alternative to the use of traditional antibody\nlabelling in electron microscopy (EM) [3], with the advantage of protein localisation through-\nout the depth of whole cells or tissues making it compatible with the latest revolutionary 3D\nEM methods [4].\nWe have previously generated expression plasmids that encode a GFP-nanobody/binding\npeptide (GBP) for high-resolution detection of GFP-tagged proteins by electron microscopy.\nTo achieve this, we genetically fused the GBP nanobody to the well-characterized soybean-\nderived enzyme APEX. When APEX–GBP is expressed in the presence of any GFP-tagged\nPOI, its localisation can be determined by transmission EM following processing [5,6].\nHere, we have developed and characterized a new suite of APEX/nanobody-mediated tools.\nAs GFP and mCherry are the most broadly used fluorescent proteins in cell biology, we used\ncell expression to screen a library of putative mCherry-binding peptides (ChBPs) by single-\nmolecule coincidence detection. We demonstrate the utility of a single mCherry nanobody for\nhigh-resolution, EM-based analysis of protein distribution and use this probe for correlative\nanalyses. Furthermore, we generate conditionally stable (cs) nanobodies for both GFP and\nmCherry fused to APEX and show that degradation of unbound cs nanobodies by the protea-\nsomal system reduces background APEX signals and results in an increased signal-to-noise\nratio. Finally, we show that the new suite of APEX nanobody tools opens up entirely new ave-\nnues for EM localisation through the application of the csAPEX-nanobody system to bimolec-\nular fluorescence complementation, allowing the detection and localisation of intracellular\nprotein-protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.\nResults and discussion\nTo date, no modular systems exist to sensitively detect mCherry-tagged POIs to high-resolu-\ntion for transmission electron microscopy. Therefore, we initially sought to generate a modu-\nlar APEX-ChBP expression vector. We screened six sequences previously shown to have\naffinity for mCherry [7] by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy in Leishmania tarento-\nlae cell-free lysate [8]. Each peptide was first expressed fused to the open reading frame of GFP\nand assayed for self-association or cross-reactivity with GFP (S1A–S1F Fig). ChBP1 and\nChBP2 behaved as monomeric proteins (S1A and S1B Fig), whereas ChBP3, ChBP4, ChBP6,\nand ChBP8 demonstrated bursts of GFP signal above baseline monomeric protein behaviour\n(S1C–S1F Fig), indicating a propensity for self-association. We next performed single-mole-\ncule coincidence detection after co-expression of mCherry-Caveolin1 (Cav1) [9]. mCherry-\nProtein interactions using conditionally stable nanobodies\nPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473\nApril 5, 2018\n2 / 11\nmanuscript.

Co-expression of GFP-\ntagged ChBP1, ChBP3, ChBP4, and ChBP6 with mCherry-Cav1 did not result in significant\ncoincidence between mCherry-Cav1 and GFP-tagged ChBP1, suggesting that these peptides\nare inefficient at binding the mCherry tag in this context (S1A and S1C–S1E Fig second and\nthird panels). However, ChBP2-GFP and ChBP8-GFP demonstrated a considerable coinci-\ndence between the GFP-tagged ChBP and mCherry-Cav1, with a coincidence ratio of Cherry\nto Cherry and GFP of approximately 0.5, indicating a 1:1 binding ratio of GFP to Cherry (S1B\nand S1F Fig second and third panel). We selected ChBP2 as the best-performing peptide in\nour analysis and incorporated this into our modular expression system (Fig 1A; mammalian\nexpression vector hitherto termed APEX-ChBP).\nTo verify that this construct could be used for high-resolution EM, we co-transfected baby\nhamster kidney (BHK) cells with APEX-ChBP and three different subcellular markers: (i)\nmCherry to denote the cytoplasm, (ii) mCherry-Cavin1 to denote caveolae on the plasma\nmembrane (PM), and (iii) 2xFYVE-mCherry to denote early endosomes. Co-expression of the\nsoluble APEX-ChBP and mCherry (with subsequent DAB reaction in the presence of H2O2\nand post-fixation with osmium tetroxide [OsO4]) resulted in the accumulation of electron\ndensity in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig 1B). This observation closely mirrored the\nexpression of GFP with APEX-GBP [6]. Cavin1 is a critical structural component of plasma\nmembrane microdomains termed ‘caveolae’ and, when present at the PM, resides only within\nthese domains [10]. When APEX-ChBP was co-transfected with mCherry-Cavin1, the electron\ndensity generated by the APEX tag and the DAB reaction was restricted to the plasma mem-\nbrane at structures with morphologies consistent with caveolae (Fig 1C). Finally, we attempted\nto localize the phosphoinositide (PI) probe 2xFYVE-mCherry (a marker of PI(3)P lipids),\nwhich are highly enriched within early endosomes [11]. Co-expression of 2xFYVE-mCherry\nand APEX-ChBP resulted in the specific accumulation of electron density surrounding struc-\ntures consistent with early endosomal morphology (Fig 1D). These data demonstrate that our\nAPEX-ChBP vector can be used to localize mCherry-tagged proteins at ultrastructural resolu-\ntion. As shown in Fig 1E–1H, use of the APEX-ChBP system is compatible with efficient cor-\nrelative light and EM. Because the APEX2 probe is visible under both light and EM, this\nrepresents a simple alternative to more complex and currently widely used CLEM methods.\nThe modular system for EM detection of fluorescently tagged POIs involves recruitment of\nAPEX-tagged binding peptides to the fluorescent protein (FP). Any unbound APEX nanobody\nwill produce a diffuse cytosolic pool that will hinder detection of the POI and reduce the sig-\nnal-to-noise ratio, particularly for low-abundance antigens. Recent work using the GBP nano-\nbody has shown that manipulation of specific conserved residues produces a cs protein that is\nrapidly degraded by the proteasomal system in the unbound state [2]. We used this knowledge\nto generate csAPEX-GBP; (schematically depicted in Fig 2A) and introduced the analogous\nresidue changes to APEX-ChBP (generating csAPEX-ChBP). Expression of csAPEX-GBP in\ncells lacking GFP co-expression resulted in only negligible cytosolic APEX signal (Fig 2B);\nhowever, in a small number of cells, restricted electron density was observed in a punctate dis-\ntribution (Fig 2B inset). We hypothesise that this signal represents the residual expression of\nAPEX-GBP in the process of proteasomal degradation. In contrast, co-expression of GFP pro-\nduced a strong cytosolic signal (Fig 2C, quantitated in S2A Fig) and a complete loss of the\npunctate distribution observed in the csAPEX-GBP alone. The csAPEX-GBP protein showed\nefficient recruitment to different cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane,\nendosomes, and caveolae, showing the functionality of the csAPEX-GBP construct for detec-\ntion of any GFP-tagged protein (Fig 2D–2F).

Cells\nexpressing csAPEX-ChBP alone showed negligible reaction product following the DAB reac-\ntion, whereas cells expressing both csAPEX-ChBP and cytoplasmic mCherry showed intense\nstaining throughout (S2B Fig). However, following a 5-h supplementation with 10 μM\nMG132, cells expressing csAPEX-ChBP alone retained DAB staining in the cytoplasm, indicat-\ning that, under normal conditions, csAPEX-ChBP is degraded by the proteasome.\nBimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a technique for testing pairwise pro-\ntein-protein interactions in fixed or living cells by genetically tagging candidates with different\nhalves of a “split” fluorescent protein [13]. If these candidates attain sufficient proximity, the\nfull length fluorescent protein is reconstituted, can fold and emit photons under excitation by\na suitable wavelength of light. We hypothesised that by using the conditionally stable APEX\nnanobody system, we should be able to extend the resolution of bifluorescence complementa-\ntion to the ultrastructural level. Indeed, the nanobody binding site in GFP (and its variants)\nstraddles the split site in commonly used BiFC pairs [13,14]. Furthermore, folding is absolutely\nrequired for the GFP–nanobody interaction, such that recognition of the unfolded halves of\nthe split protein by GBP is a theoretical impossibility. Using this technique, we were able to\ndirectly visualize interactions between Cavin1 and Cavin3 by EM using split mVenus, a YFP\nderivative recognised by the GBP. We transfected BHK cells with vectors encoding Cavin1\nfused to the N-terminal fragment of mVenus, (Cavin1-mVenus1–155), Cavin3 fused to the C-\nterminal fragment (Cavin3-mVenus156–239), and our csAPEX-GBP construct, schematically\nrepresented in Fig 2K. Using this technique, we were able to delineate surface caveolae and\nputative endocytic caveolar carriers associated with intracellular compartments (Fig 2L, fur-\nther examples in S2C and S2D Fig). The reciprocal experiment, in which the N- and C-termi-\nnal fragments of mVenus were exchanged, showed similar results (Fig 2M). Unusually high-\nexpressing cells were occasionally visible, showing aggregation of intracellular Cavin recog-\nnised by csAPEX-GBP (Fig 2N). Transfection with just one-half of the split YFP most com-\nmonly showed no cytoplasmic staining (Fig 2O). However, inclusions of increased density\nwere sometimes noted in these controls (Fig 2P, further example in S2E Fig) and were absent\nfrom untransfected samples. This staining was clearly distinguishable from the specific signal\nshown in Fig 2L and 2M, although the importance of such controls is emphasized, particularly\nsince different cell types may contain different numbers of proteasomes. These results clearly\ndemonstrate that protein–protein interactions can be effectively visualized using bimolecular\nfluorescence complementation at the ultrastructural level using csAPEX-GBP.\nIn summary, we have utilised cell-free expression and single-molecule analysis to screen a\nnumber putative ChBP for association with mCherry-tagged Caveolin-1. The single nanobody\nwe identify is a selective, high-affinity binder of the mCherry tag, lacks detectable self-aggrega-\ntion or cross-reactivity with GFP, can be linked to APEX for high-resolution analysis of\nmCherry-tagged proteins in cell culture systems, and is compatible with correlative light and\nhighlight areas of enriched electron density. Note the increased density in the cytoplasm compared to mitochondria. Scale bars: lower magnification = 1 μm;\ninsets = 500 nm.

We have also employed conditional stabilisation of both GFP and mCherry binding nano-\nbodies fused to APEX2 which results in the generation of an APEX reaction product only\nwhen bound to their target fluorescent proteins. By degrading unbound APEX-BP protein,\nthis modification facilitates an improved signal-to-noise ratio and circumvents any potential\noversaturation of the APEX-BP vector. Finally, we have coupled the csAPEX-GBP system with\nbimolecular fluorescence complementation. This now allows direct visualisation of intracellu-\nlar protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level, far beyond the resolution of light\nmicroscopy. This system is immediately applicable (without any new cloning steps) to any sys-\ntem in which the fluorescent split GFP system has been used. Unlike labelling on sections,\nAPEX methods are compatible with 3D EM methods [4] such as focused ion beam-scanning\nEM, serial blockface-scanning EM, and electron tomography and can be used in whole animal\nsystems [5]. As cellular function depends not on single proteins but on protein–protein inter-\nactions, these methods will be a vital complement to dynamic light microscopic methods.\nMaterials and methods\nSingle-molecule counting and coincidence detection\nSingle-molecule spectroscopy was performed as previously described [9]. Briefly, samples\n(20 μl) were loaded into a custom-made silicone 192-well plate adhered to glass coverslips\n(ProSciTech Australia). Samples were analysed with two lasers (488 nm and 561 nm) using a\nZeiss LSM710 microscope with a Conforcor3 module for single-molecule counting and a sin-\ngle 488-nm laser for aggregation analyses. The fluorescence emission was filtered with 505–\n540-nm band pass filter (GFP) and 580-nm long-pass filter (mCherry). Measurements were\ntaken with photon counts in the approximate range of 750–2,000 which corresponds to a GFP\nconcentration of around 1–2.5 μg/ml. Three replicates were carried out for each construct\npair, and consistent results were obtained for each.\nCell culture\nBHK cells were passaged in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with\n10% Fetal Bovine Serum and L-Glutamine. Cells were seeded onto 35-mm culture dishes\nFig 2. Conditional stabilisation of GBP and ChBP, and detection of protein–protein interactions using bimolecular\nfluorescence complementation. A) Schematic illustrating detection of GFP-tagged POIs using csAPEX-GBP. The probe is degraded\nby the proteasome unless stabilized by interactions with a GFP-tagged protein, resulting in loss of any nonspecific, electron-dense\nAPEX signal when csAPEX-GBP does not bind to its target. B) csAPEX-GBP shows minimal signal when expressed in cells lacking\nGFP-tagged proteins; only a low level of labelling is detectable in specific regions of a subset of cells (inset, arrows). In contrast, cells\nco-expressing soluble GFP together with csAPEX-GBP show a strong cytosolic signal (C, quantitated in S2 Fig. A). D-F) Examples of\nsubcompartment-specific labelling in cells expressing GFP-tagged POIs associating with the PM, the early endosomes, and caveolae,\nrespectively. G-H) Examples of subcompartment-specific labelling in cells expressing mCherry-tagged POIs associating with the PM,\nnucleus, early endosomes, and caveolae, respectively. K-P) Co-transfection of BHK cells with constructs tagged with each half of split\nYFP along with csAPEX-GBP gives strong and specific labelling at sites of protein–protein interactions. K) Schematic illustrating\ndetection of interactions between two POIs tagged with different halves of a split YFP. csAPEX-GBP is able to bind only when the\nYFP pair is fully reconstituted and folded. In the absence of a correctly folded GFP derivative, csAPEX-GBP is degraded by the\nproteasome. L) Cavin1-YFP-N and Cavin3-YFP-C co-expression gives specific labelling associated with PM pits and vesicular\nprofiles characteristic of caveolae. Note the specificity of the labelling, which allows identification of Cavin1/Cavin3 complexes\nassociated with both surface caveolae and putative endocytic caveolar carriers associated with intracellular compartments (arrow).\nFurther examples are shown in S2B and S2C Fig. M) Reciprocal experimental conditions with specific fragments of YFP switched\nbetween constructs gives consistent labelling. N) Cells with an abnormally high transfection level show intracellular aggregates of\nCavin (compare with caveolar labelling in L and M). O) Control cells transfected with just one split GFP half and csAPEX-GBP show\nno labelling in the majority of cells. P) APEX positive inclusions are seen in a small percentage of control cells. These are clearly\ndistinguishable from the specific staining of the recombined protein complex (L-M). Further examples are shown in S2 Fig. D.

For bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, an 8-h\nincubation in 50 μM cyclohexamide prior to processing was used to reduce background\nstaining.\nEM\nEM was performed exactly as described previously [5,6]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 2.5% glu-\ntaraldehyde in 0.1-M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed\nwith cacodylate buffer to remove the fixative, then washed with DAB in cacodylate buffer for 1\nmin and subsequently treated with DAB in cacodylate buffer containing H2O2 for 30 min at\nroom temperature. Cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 2 min to provide contrast. Cells\nwere then washed in water and serially dehydrated in increasing percentages of ethanol before\nserial infiltration with LX112 resin in a BioWave microwave (Pelco). Resin was polymerised to\nhardness at 60˚C overnight. Ultrathin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (UC6: Leica)\nand imaged at 80 kV on a JEOL1011 transmission electron microscope. Sections were not\npost-stained.\nCorrelative light and EM\nCells were grown on 35-mm gridded MatTek dishes (with an in-plane alphanumeric code)\nand co-transfected with nls-mCherry and APEX-ChBP. Live cell imaging was performed on\nan EVOS FL epifluorescent microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 10x and 20x magnifica-\ntion. Cells were processed as described above with the following exceptions. Post-polymerisa-\ntion, the flat-embedded cells were removed from the dish and the region of interest was\ntrimmed using the now-imprinted grid coordinates on the block face. Ultrathin sections were\ncut, placed on a slot grid, and imaged on a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope fitted\nwith a 4K x 4K LC1100 camera (Direct Electron) at 120 kV under the control of SerialEM.\nLow-magnification (4,400 XMag) montages were acquired at a binning of 1 and stitched\ntogether using the Blendmont program in IMOD. Correlation of light and EM images was per-\nformed using Photoshop (Adobe Inc.).\nConstructs and cloning\nSplit mVenus constructs were made by first removing the Fos and Jun inserts from pcs_kmVe-\nnus1-155_FosLZ135-171 and pcs_kmVenus156-239_JunLZ253-289 using EcoRV/SpeI.\nHuman Cavin1 and Cavin3 open reading frames were amplified by PCR using the primer tags\nforward 50-AGCGGCGGCGGCTCTGATATC-30 and reverse 50-ACAAGAAAGCTGGGT\nACTAGT-30 and subcloned using infusion (BD). The series of ChBP-GFP expression vectors\nfor L. tarentolae expression were constructed by PCR subcloning from the original templates\n[7] into the cell-free gateway cloning vector ‘N-term 8xHis eGFP pCellFree_G03’ [8] (Genbank\nKJ541667) using the following primer tags: forward 50-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAA\nGCAGGCTC-30, reverse 50-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTT-30.

Moreover, discrepancies between preclinical and\nclinical outcomes demand a reliable translational platform that can precisely\nrecapitulate the characteristics of human glioblastoma. Here we analyze the\nintratumoral blood-brain-tumor barrier heterogeneity in human glioblastoma\nand characterize two genetically engineered models in female mice that\nrecapitulate two important glioma phenotypes, including the diffusely inﬁl-\ntrative tumor margin and angiogenic core. We show that pulsed laser excita-\ntion of vascular-targeted gold nanoparticles non-invasively and reversibly\nmodulates the blood-brain-tumor barrier permeability (optoBBTB) and\nenhances the delivery of paclitaxel in these two models. The treatment reduces\nthe tumor volume by 6 and 2.4-fold and prolongs the survival by 50% and 33%,\nrespectively. Since paclitaxel does not penetrate the blood-brain-tumor barrier\nand is abandoned for glioblastoma treatment following its failure in early-\nphase clinical trials, our results raise the possibility of reevaluating a number of\npotent anticancer drugs by combining them with strategies to increase blood-\nbrain-tumor barrier permeability.

One obstacle in conventional therapies is the inability to\nachieve adequate drug concentrations in the brain due to the protec-\ntive blood-brain barrier (BBB). Formed by a tight-junction (TJ) protein\ncomplex and adherens junctions between the brain microvascular\nendothelial cells and modulated by surrounding stromal cells (peri-\ncytes and astrocytes), the BBB excludes or limits the delivery of 98% of\nconventional chemotherapies to subtherapeutic levels5. Although\nGBM can disrupt the integrity of the BBB in the hypoxic and angiogenic\ncore, the magnitude of this local disruption is nonuniform or insufﬁ-\ncient to allow drug penetration in meaningful quantities6–10. Moreover,\nevidence suggests that GBM has tumor cells inﬁltrating into the\nneighboring tissue without disrupting the BBB, which subsequently\ndrives the inevitable fatal recurrence11. Therefore, we need strategies\nto overcome the BBB, or the blood-brain-tumor barrier (BBTB), in both\nangiogenic core and inﬁltrative margins to achieve signiﬁcant\nimprovement in disease management and patient survival.\nSeveral strategies to overcome BBTB for therapeutic delivery have\nbeen developed, including using hyperosmotic agents (mannitol),\nopening the TJ with a TJ modulator, and enhancing drug penetration\nthrough inhibiting drug efﬂux transporters or via receptor-mediated\ntransport6,11–13. While these strategies may improve drug delivery to\nbrain tumors, lack of spatial resolution, high incidences of complica-\ntions, and potential for toxicity have impeded progress in clinical\ntranslation12,13. Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with intravenously\n(i.v.) administered microbubbles is a local, minimally invasive method\nfor transiently disrupting the BBTB and has progressed to early-phase\nclinical trials14–16. Recently, we demonstrated an optical method to\nincrease BBB permeability reversibly17. Nevertheless, the poor survival\nwith currently approved treatments for GBM and the failure of many\npromising results at the clinical trial stage highlight the compelling\nneed to develop and validate treatment strategies with clinically rele-\nvant GBM models to bridge the gap between preclinical efﬁcacy and\nsuccessful clinical translation18–20.\nIn this work, we report a GBM treatment approach by BBTB\nmodulation followed by chemotherapy in clinically relevant inﬁltrative\nand angiogenic GBM models. We ﬁrst provide evidence that human\nGBM shows intratumoral heterogeneous BBTB permeability, including\nboth leaky and intact BBTB regions. To capture these features in pre-\nclinical mouse models, we characterize two genetically engineered\nmouse models (GEMMs) that show diffuse single-cell inﬁltration\nthrough the brain parenchyma (former, PS5A1) or a rapidly expanding\nangiogenic mass with limited single-cell inﬁltration (the latter, 73 C),\nrespectively. These primary conditional mouse cell lines carry muta-\ntions seen in both adult and pediatric high-grade gliomas (namely, (1)\nBrafV600E, INK4ab/Arf−/−, PTEN−/−, for PS5A1 GEMM, and (2) BrafV600E,\nP53−/−, PTEN−/−, for 73 C GEMM). Together these two GEMMs represent\na reasonable facsimile of the GBM tumor-stromal phenotype seen in\nthe clinical setting. We subsequently apply pulsed laser stimulation of\ntight junction-targeted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to reversibly\nmodulate the BBTB permeability (optoBBTB) in the GEMMs and show\nthe brain delivery of an oncology drug paclitaxel (Taxol). Taxol is\namong the most widely used oncology drug because of its proven\nefﬁcacy in multiple cancer subtypes, but it is abandoned for GBM\ntreatment following its failure in early-phase clinical trials due to poor\nbrain penetration21–24. Moreover, although several highly speciﬁc\nBrafV600E inhibitors have shown to be effective for treating melanoma25,\nthese drugs are only transiently effective with tumors (including mel-\nanoma brain metastasis) rapidly developing resistance to BrafV600E\ninhibitors26. Therefore, the consideration of Taxol delivery to our\nBrafV600E models is highly relevant, since BrafV600E inhibitor clinical trials\nfor brain tumors are ongoing27,28. This study reveals that repeated\ncycles of optoBBTB coupled with systemic administration of Taxol\nsuppress tumor growth (6 and 2.4- fold) by reducing tumor cell pro-\nliferation and increasing cell death, resulting in signiﬁcantly improved\nmedian survival (50% and 33% increase) in the inﬁltrative (PS5A1) and\nangiogenic (73 C) models, respectively. Our investigations provide\nevidence\nof\nBBTB\nmodulation\nand\ntherapeutic\nbeneﬁts\nusing\noptoBBTB in clinically relevant models.\nResults\nCharacterization of diffusely inﬁltrative PS5A1 GEMM and\nangiogenic 73 C GEMM\nWe examined a human GBM that shows intratumoral BBTB hetero-\ngeneity and recurrence. The patient was treated with standard of care\nfor GBM, including surgical resection and concurrent radiation (60 Gy)\nand TMZ, followed by 12 monthly cycles of TMZ. At the end of treat-\nment and for 4 years of serial MR imaging, there was no evidence of\nrecurrence (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, within 4 months after an\nunchanged MR scan, the patient developed focal seizures, and a repeat\nMRI showed a new enhancing mass at the medial tumor margin\n(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Biopsy of the mass revealed a classic GBM\nphenotype with microvascular proliferation and tumor proliferation\nrate (MIB-1) of 80% (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). These results suggest\nthat human GBM shows inﬁltrative characteristics and marginal\nrecurrence with no initial contrast enhancement (therefore intact\nBBTB), indicating the clinical need to establish pre-clinical GEMMs that\ncapture these hallmarks to assess the drug efﬁcacy and therapeutic\nstrategies accurately.\nTo recapitulate these features in preclinical models, we char-\nacterized two GEMMs in terms of their BBTB integrity, tumor pro-\ngression patterns, and TJ properties. These GEMMs were generated\nusing neural-stem-cell–derived PS5A1 (BrafV600E, INK4ab/Arf−/−, PTEN−/−,\nSupplementary Fig. 2a, c) and astrocyte-derived glioma cell line 73 C\n(BrafV600E, PTEN−/−, P53−/−, Supplementary Fig. 2b, c)29,30. These cell lines\nwere engineered to express green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). We ﬁrst\nestablished PS5A1 and 73 C GEMMs in female nude mice (Nu/J, 002019,\nage 7 weeks, the Jackson Laboratory) and evaluated their BBTB per-\nmeability. Speciﬁcally, 368 nL of PS5A1 glioma cell suspension or 92 nL\nof 73 C glioma cells (2 × 105/µL) was constantly injected into the mouse\ncortex (−1 mm, −1 mm, 0.5 mm) using a nanoinjector equipped with a\nglass micropipette (50 µm tip, see methods for details). The BBTB\nintegrity of the mice during GBM progression was analyzed using i.v.\ninjection of EZ-link biotin (660 Da) and Evans blue (66 kDa, albumin-\nbound). Figure 1a and c show that in PS5A1 GEMM, the dye was con-\nﬁned in the blood vessels in both tumor coreand margin at14-, 28-, and\n42-days post injection (dpi), indicating the intact BBTB. However, 73 C\nGEMM showed immature dysfunctional tumor-associated vessels\nduring disease progression. At 7 dpi, both low and high molecular\nweight ﬂuorescent dyes were limited to the microvascular lumen in the\ntumor core region and at the margins of the expanding mass that\ninterface with the normal brain parenchyma, also at the contralateral\nhemisphere (Fig. 1b, d), suggesting an intact BBTB at 7 dpi. On the\ncontrary, at 14 and 21 dpi, following the rapid expansion of the tumor\nmass, there was clear evidence of dye extravasation in the tumor core\nregions but absent at the tumor margins. These observations suggest\nthat the tumor core region was perfused by a microvasculature with\ncompromised BBTB integrity. In contrast, the tumor margin region\nwas characterized by limited inﬁltration into the surrounding brain\nparenchyma, which remained stable and had intact BBTB at the sam-\npling time.\nWe subsequently investigated the tumor progression patterns in\nthe two GEMMs. The PS5A1 tumor cells displayed a heterogeneous\npattern of brain inﬁltration, moving along brain capillaries, through\nthe neuropil-rich gray matter, and parallel to myelinated axons along\nthe white matter tracts (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3a). There was no\nevidence of angiogenesis with this diffusely invasive GBM model since\nvascular density identiﬁed by both structure (endothelial marker CD31\npositive cells) and perfusion (luminal wall labeling with tomato lec-\ntin594) were similar in the tumor core and margin regions compared\nwith that of the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 2a, b). This data\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40579-1\nNature Communications|   (2023) 14:4934 \n2\n\nsuggests that in PS5A1 GEMM, tumor growth and inﬁltration are pro-\nmoted by co-opting the normal dense brain microvasculature for\nnutrient and metabolic support (Supplementary Fig. 3b).\nIt is well established that tumor core regions release proangio-\ngenic signals, leading to the formation of immature and dysfunctional\nnetworks of blood vessels31. To verify our 73 C GEMM, we evaluated the\nimmunostaining of junctional proteins, Claudin-5, ZO-1, VE-Cadherin,\nOccludin, and JAM-A with CD31-labeled endothelial cells. Notably,\nCD31-labeled microvascular density was signiﬁcantly increased in the\ntumor core compared with the tumor margin and contralateral brain\nregion (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In contrast, i.v. injection of tomato\nlectin594 to label perfused vessels showed a marked increase in the\nratio of cell nuclei labeled with Hoechst dye (HOE) to the blood vessels\n(HOE/lectin) in the tumor compared with the contralateral brain\n(Supplementary Fig. 4b, top). However, there was no signiﬁcant dif-\nference in this ratio with IHC staining of blood vessels using CD31\n(HOE/CD31, Supplementary Fig. 4b, bottom). These results suggest\nthat the perfused vessels (lectin labeled) in the 73 C tumor core need to\nsupport an increased number of tumor cells, which can lead to hypoxia\nand angiogenesis. Furthermore, the tumor core region contains a\nsigniﬁcant fraction of either nascent vessels that have yet to form a\nfunctional conduit and/or have formed non-functional end-vessels\nc\nDPI\n2\n4\n6\nEB Coverage \nArea (%)\n14\n28\n42\nn.s.\nn.s.\nn.s.\nd\na\ni\nEB\nb\nHOE\nEB\nBiotin\n(1) 7 dpi\n2.

The irregular\nmicrovasculature structure, associated with poor hemodynamics and\nhigh metabolic demands of the tumor mass, creates an environment of\nrelative hypoxia which contributes to tumor angiogenesis and often\nregions of necrosis, a pathognomonic histologic feature of GBM. IHC\nstaining of junctional proteins showed that the immunoﬂuorescence\nof Claudin-5, VE-Cadherin, Occludin, and JAM-A persisted during 7–21\ndpi at both tumor core and margin (Supplementary Fig. 5a, Fig. 2c).\nHowever, there was a signiﬁcantly lower level of ZO-1 expression at the\ntumor core at 14 and 21 dpi (Fig. 2d). Further quantiﬁcation of the area\nfraction ratio of protein over blood vessel (CD31) suggested that the\nrelative protein coverage ratio for Claudin-5, VE-Cadherin, Occludin,\nand JAM-A was comparable at the tumor core, margin, and con-\ntralateral side during 7–21 dpi. Although no apparent change in the ZO-\n1/CD31 was observed at 7 dpi, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in this\nratio at the tumor core and margin at 14 and 21 dpi (Fig. 2d). We\nspeculate that the BBTB disruption in the tumor core during disease\nprogression is partially due to the loss of ZO-1 coverage on immature\nnewly formed vessels.\nTaken together, the characterization of the PS5A1 GEMM\ndemonstrates that it is a suitable in vivo model for studying the chal-\nlenges of drug delivery across an intact BBTB that mimic the inﬁltrative\ntumor margin found in human GBM. Moreover, our spatiotemporal\nanalysis of tumor vasculature suggests that the 73 C GEMM features\nrobust angiogenesis and heterogeneous BBTB with immature dys-\nfunctional tumor-associated vessels, similar to what is seen in the core\nregion of human GBM. These two GEMMs faithfully recapitulate the\ncharacteristics of human GBM and make them suitable surrogates for\nassessing drug delivery strategies.\nOptoBBTB improves drug penetration in PS5A1 and 73 C GEMMs\nWe next investigated whether optoBBTB improves drug penetration in\nthe PS5A1 diffusely inﬁltrative GEMM. First, TJ component JAM-A tar-\ngeted nanoparticles (AuNP-BV11, 50 nm) were prepared, and their\nphysicochemical\nproperties\nwere\ncharacterized\n(Supplementary\nFig. 6). Their ability to modulate BBB and safety proﬁles have been\nthoroughly investigated17. These nanoparticles were i.v. injected into a\ntumor-bearing mouse, followed by the delivery of a transcranial\n532 nm picosecond laser pulse to the tumor region to stimulate the\nAuNPs for BBTB modulation (optoBBTB, Fig. 3a). The 532 nm picose-\ncond laser was exploited for optoBBTB since the wavelength matches\nwell with the surface plasmon resonance peak of the 50 nm spherical\ngold nanoparticles (530 nm). Fluorescent dyes or therapeutics were\nthen delivered to assess the BBTB permeability and brain uptake. To\noptimize the optoBBTB, a series of nanoparticle doses and laser ﬂu-\nences were tested (Supplementary Table 1). We selected 18.5 µg/g of\nAuNP-BV11 injection followed by 40 mJ/cm2 laser ﬂuence (1 pulse) for\nBBTB opening since it showed high opening efﬁcacy with minimized\nnanoparticle injection (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We further demon-\nstrated that optoBBTB modulation allowed the delivery of molecules\nof different sizes in PS5A1 GEMM, such as EZ-link biotin (660 Da) and\nEvans blue/albumin (66 kDa) (Fig. 3b). The BBTB modulation was\nreversible and largely recovered in 1 day (Supplementary Fig. 7b). To\ninvestigate if there is a laser-induced heating effect in the tumor area,\nwe recorded the local temperature change using a FLIR ONE Thermal\nImaging Camera before and after optoBBTB on the mouse’s skull. The\nresults show that the average temperature before and after optoBBTB\nwas 32.1 ± 0.1 °C and 32.3 ± 0.2 °C in PS5A1 GEMM (Supplementary\nFig. 7c), suggesting no apparent temperature increase after optoBBTB.\nSince most chemotherapy drugs are administered over multiple\ndoses with intervals for recovery, it is important to assess the feasibility\nof\nmultiple\nBBTB\nmodulations\nfor\ndrug\ndelivery.\nTaxol\nis a\nmicrotubule-stabilizing drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of\novarian, breast, and lung cancer, as well as Kaposi’s sarcoma21. Fol-\nlowing the failure of Taxol to show efﬁcacy in an early-phase clinical\ntrial for GBM, further testing was abandoned. However, Taxol cannot\npass through the BBB, which may partly account for the lack of clinical\nefﬁcacy. To investigate the effectiveness of optoBBTB in Taxol deliv-\nery, we ﬁrst demonstrated that optoBBTB using i.v. injection of AuNP-\nPEG with no speciﬁc targeting to TJ protein did not improve the\ndelivery of Taxol Janelia Fluor 646 (Taxol646) into the tumor region\n(Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 7d). Next, we performed optoBBTB with\ni.v. injection of AuNP-BV11, followed by the administration of Taxol646\nto PS5A1 GEMM for three times with 3 days between treatments, to\ninvestigate the impact of multiple BBTB openings during tumor\ntreatment. Figure 3d shows that the ﬁrst cycle of optoBBTB at 14 dpi\nled to an increase in Taxol delivery and accumulation in the tumor core\nand margin area, as did the second and third optoBBTB cycles (18 and\n22 dpi). Notably, there was no evidence of ﬂuorescent Taxol leakage in\nthe contralateral hemisphere, which reconﬁrmed the inability of this\ndrug to pass through the normal BBB. We further analyzed the\nbioaccumulation and biodegradation of the gold nanoparticles in the\ntumor and healthy brain in PS5A1 GEMM after each optoBBTB by\nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results\nshow that there was an increased gold accumulation in the brain and\nthe tumor, i.e., from 0.9 ± 0.5 µg/g to 4 ± 1 µg/g in the brain and from\n1.3 ± 0.4 µg/g to 3.6 ± 1.3 µg/g in the tumor. No signiﬁcant difference in\nthe gold concentration was observed in the tumor and healthy brain\n(Supplementary Fig. 7e, Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the slow\ngold clearance proﬁle in mice was in agreement with the literature\n(Supplementary Fig. 7f)32–34. In summary, optoBBTB can be repeated\nand allows a multiple-cycle treatment regimen in PS5A1 GEMM that\nrecapitulates the tumor margin histopathological characteristics.\nWe subsequently investigated the efﬁcacy of optoBBTB in the 73 C\nGEMM. The overexpression of JAM-A in the tumor area due to the\nformation of angiogenic vessels made the nanoparticles attractive for\nenhanced GBM accumulation (Fig. 4a). ICP-MS analysis showed a >50%\nincrease of AuNP-BV11 accumulation in the tumor compared with\nnormal brain tissue (3.0 ± 0.5 versus 1.8 ± 0.2 µg/g in tumor and normal\nbrain, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 8a). We further optimized the\noptoBBTB in the 73 C GEMM to obtain the optimal opening efﬁciency\nafter single-pulse laser stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 8b, Supple-\nmentary Table 3). The highest BBTB opening level was achieved by\ninjecting 37 µg/g of AuNP-BV11 and applying 40 mJ/cm2 laser excitation\n(1 pulse). The BBTB recovered within 1 day, and no dye leakage into the\nbrain was observed afterward (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Since the BBTB\nin 73 C GEMM remained intact at 7 dpi, optoBBTB signiﬁcantly\nimproved the delivery of both small molecules (EZ-link biotin, 660 Da)\nand large molecules (Evans blue, 66 kDa) after i.v. injection (Fig. 4b),\nwhile BBTB modulation using AuNP-PEG did not increase the Taxol646\ndelivery into the tumor (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 8d). The local\ntemperature measurement shows that the average temperature before\nand after laser excitation was 32.1 ± 0.2 °C and 31.9 ± 0.1°C (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 8e), indicating no temperature increase after optoBBTB in\n73 C GEMM. Similarly, a three-cycle treatment regimen could be used\nfor drug delivery in 73 C GEMM (Fig. 4d).\nWe noted that the BBTB modulation displayed a higher efﬁciency\nin the PS5A1 GEMM than in the 73 C GEMM (Figs. 3, 4, Supplementary\nFigs. 7, 8), although there was a signiﬁcantly higher AuNP-BV11 accu-\nmulation in the tumor core of 73 C GEMM compared with PS5A1 GEMM\n(3.0 ± 0.5 µg/g,\nand\n1.3 ± 0.4 µg/g,\nrespectively,\nSupplementary\nTable 4). To increase the BBTB opening efﬁciency in the 73 C GEMM,\nwe attempted to functionalize AuNPs with other vasculature targets,\nsuch as the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2) anti-\nbody and the anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody, since VEGFR2\nand TfR overexpression was observed in 73 C GEMM (Supplementary\nFig. 9a, b). However, these nanoparticles did not improve BBTB\nopening efﬁciency compared with AuNP-BV11 (Supplementary Fig. 9c).\nTo probe the mechanisms of the optoBBTB, we analyzed the changes\nin the irregular blood vessels in 73 C GEMM after laser stimulation\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40579-1\nNature Communications|   (2023) 14:4934 \n5\n\na\nb\n(1)\n(2)\nTranscranial laser \nexcitation (532 nm)\nBBTB\nBrain\nparenchyma\nBlood\nTumor\nBrain \nparenchyma\nEC\nBlood\nTJ\nVascular targeting nanoparticles \nFluorescent dye/therapeutics\nd\n14 dpi: 1st modulation\n(1) AuNP-BV11\n(2) Taxol 646\n18 dpi: 2nd modulation\n22 dpi: 3rd modulation\nGFP\n*\nTaxol646\n*\n*\n(1) AuNP-BV11\n(2) Taxol 646\n(1) AuNP-BV11\n(2) Taxol 646\noptoBBTB(AuNP-PEG): GFP/Taxol646\nc\noptoBBTB(AuNP-BV11): GFP/Biotin\noptoBBTB(AuNP-BV11): GFP/EB\n*\n*\nFig. 3 | OptoBBTB improves drug penetration to the brain in the inﬁltrative\nPS5A1 GEMM. a Schematic illustration of optoBBTB.

The blood vessel density analysis showed that\noptoBBTB did not impact the vessel coverage percentages in the\ntumor core and margin (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Moreover, no sig-\nniﬁcant difference in the immunoﬂuorescence of junctional protein\nwas observed before and after optoBBTB (Supplementary Fig. 5b).\nThese results suggest that optoBBTB in 73 C GEMM did not inﬂuence\nthe density or the junctional protein immunoﬂuorescence of the\nangiogenic blood vessels. In our recent work35, we demonstrated that\nlaser excitation of vascular-targeting AuNPs was associated with a\ntransient elevation and propagation of Ca2+, actin polymerization, and\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein\nkinase). They collectively activated the cytoskeleton resulting in\nincreased paracellular permeability. We hypothesize that the increased\nbarrier permeability after optoBBTB is due to the Ca2+-mediated acti-\nvation of the mechanobiological pathways and the re-arrangement of\nthe cytoskeleton.

We began with evaluating\nthe drug efﬁcacy and mechanism of action in vitro. Taxol binds to the\nmitotic spindle apparatus and disrupts chromosomal segregation,\nwhich leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death21,36,37. In vitro ﬂuor-\nescent imaging showed the internalization of Taxol646 in PS5A1 tumor\ncells after 1-h co-incubation (Supplementary Fig. 10a). These cells were\nsensitive to the Taxol with an IC50 value of 6.3 nM after 72 h of incu-\nbation (Supplementary Fig. 10b). To assess the treatment efﬁcacy of\noptoBBTB in PS5A1 GEMM, mice were randomly grouped at 14 dpi and\ntreated intravenously with (1) vehicle, (2) free Taxol (12.5 mg/kg), (3)\noptoBBTB followed by vehicle delivery, and (4) optoBBTB followed by\nTaxol delivery (12.5 mg/kg). The treatment regimen included 3 cycles\nat 3-day intervals starting from 14 dpi to 22 dpi, and the treatment\nefﬁciency was evaluated at 42 dpi (Fig. 5a). The data show that\noptoBBTB greatly enhanced the delivery of ﬂuorescent Taxol646 in\nthe tumor core and margin compared with no optoBBTB treatment\n(Fig. 5b, c). The Taxol concentration in the tumor without or with\noptoBBTB was 12 ± 15 ng/g and 185 ± 92 ng/g, respectively, indicating a\n16-fold concentration increase after optoBBTB (Fig. 5d). These tumors\nshowed no T1-weighted contrast enhancement by MRI consistent with\nan intact BBTB and minimal T2-weighted hyperintensity (Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 11a). This observation is consistent with the clinical scenario\nwhere GBM cells are undetectable to conventional MR sequences38. To\nverify the presence of tumor cells, we collected all the tumor-\ncontaining brain slices and analyzed the tumor volume by GFP ﬂuor-\nescent (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Remarkably, optoBBTB+Taxol yiel-\nded the smallest tumor volume (4 ± 2 mm3), a 5–7-fold reduction when\ncompared\nwith\nvehicle\n(47 ± 6 mm3),\nTaxol\n(44 ± 29 mm3),\nand\noptoBBTB+vehicle (33 ± 9 mm3) groups (Fig. 5e). Moreover, optoBBTB\n+Taxol delivery signiﬁcantly increased the median overall survival by\n50%, from 40 days to 60 days (Fig. 5f), due to a marked inhibition of\ntumor growth (Fig. 5g, h, i top). Ki67 staining and cell apoptosis ana-\nlysis were performed by calculating the signal-positive (ki67+ or\nTUNEL + ) cell numbers over total cell numbers. The results show that\noptoBBTB+Taxol decreased cell proliferation and increased cellular\napoptosis compared with the other groups (Fig. 5i middle-bottom, j, k).\nBody weight at 42 dpi was similar across treatment groups (Fig. 5l),\nindicating that the AuNP administration and the treatments did not\ninduce\nsigniﬁcant\nadditional\nsystematic\ntoxicity.\nThese\nresults\ndemonstrate that optoBBTB allows the brain entry of Taxol, leading to\ntreatment response and improved overall survival in inﬁltrative GEMM.\nWe subsequently analyzed the therapeutic effect of Taxol on the\nangiogenic 73 C GEMM. Co-incubation of 73 C tumor cells and\nTaxol646 (3 µM) showed that Taxol accumulated in the microtubules\nenriched cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 12a), consistent with its\nknown mechanisms of action to bind to and stabilize microtubules39.\nFurthermore, Taxol was highly potent against 73 C tumor cells with an\nIC50 value of 10.52 nM (Supplementary Fig. 12b). To evaluate the\noptoBBTB in vivo on the angiogenic 73 C GEMM, we started with\nmeasuring the initial tumor volume by MRI at 3 dpi. The mice were\nrandomly grouped and treated with (1) vehicle, (2) Taxol (12.5 mg/kg),\n(3) optoBBTB followed by vehicle, and (4) optoBBTB followed by Taxol\n(12.5 mg/kg). We performed three treatments at a 3-day interval (cov-\nering 4-12 dpi). At 15 dpi, we measured the tumor volume by MRI and\nharvested the brains for histological analysis (Fig. 6a). MRI T2-\nweighted scan was used to measure the tumor volume since T1-\nweighted gadolinium enhancement showed low signal intensity,\nprobably due to the intact BBTB at the early tumor stage (e.g., 3 dpi,\nSupplementary Fig. 13a). Figure 6b, c show that a single dose of\noptoBBTB enhanced the delivery of Taxol to the tumor core and\nmargin compared with no optoBBTB treatment. The Taxol con-\ncentration in the tumor without or with optoBBTB was 240 ± 168 ng/g\nand 1206 ± 1094 ng/g, indicating a 5-fold concentration increase after\noptoBBTB (Fig. 6d). The enhanced Taxol delivery produced a statisti-\ncally signiﬁcant difference in slowing the tumor progression and\nincreasing survival (Fig. 6e–i). Tumor volume analysis by MRI showed\nthat optoBBTB+Taxol delivery resulted in a 2.2 to 2.6-fold volume\nreduction in the tumor (36 ± 7 mm3) compared with vehicle (90 ± 20\nmm3), Taxol (77 ± 8 mm3), and optoBBTB+vehicle delivery (90 ± 10\nmm3) by MRI (Fig. 6e, Supplementary Fig. 13b). The smallest tumor size\nin the group of optoBBTB+Taxol was also conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescent\nimaging (Fig. 6g) and Hoechst staining of cell nuclei (Fig. 6i, top).\nConsistent with the smaller tumor volume seen at 15 dpi, the overall\nmedian survival of the mice was also increased by 33% from 18 days to\n24 days after optoBBTB+Taxol treatment (Fig. 6f). Immunohistology\nanalysis of the tumors in the optoBBTB+Taxol group showed a marked\ndecrease in proliferation (Ki67 positive cells) as well as an increase in\ncell death (TUNEL positive cells) relative to the other cohorts (Fig. 6i\nmiddle, bottom, j, k). These data suggest that following BBTB disrup-\ntion, Taxol can induce cell cycle arrest and cell death. No signiﬁcant\ndifference in body weight was observed by the end of three treatments\n(Fig. 6l). Taken together, our data show that optoBBTB can sig-\nniﬁcantly enhance the delivery of Taxol to an angiogenic 73 C GEMM\nwith a rapidly expanding tumor mass, which is sufﬁcient to induce\ntumor cell death and cell-cycle arrest leading to increased overall\nsurvival.\nDiscussion\nGBM is considered surgically incurable due to its ability to diffusely\ninﬁltrate through the brain parenchyma, well beyond the regions\noutlined by T1-weighted contrast enhancement. There is increasing\ninterest in extending the surgical margins to include the non-\nenhancing T2-weighted regions of abnormal signals. However, early\nclinical studies have shown only a marginal beneﬁt, which must be\nweighed against the increased risk of neurological injury associated\nwith removing the functional brain. Therefore, enhancing drug\nFig. 5 | OptoBBTB improves therapeutic outcomes in the inﬁltrative PS5A1\nGEMM. a Schematic illustration of the treatment timeline.

In this study, we\nshowed that the optoBBTB reversibly increases BBTB permeability in\ntwo clinically relevant GEMMs that recapitulate GBM margin (inﬁl-\ntrative, PS5A1 GEMM) and core (angiogenic, 73 C GEMM) character-\nistics. Taxol is a common chemotherapeutic agent previously\nabandoned following an early-phase clinical trial due to its limited\nbrain penetration. Its efﬁcacy in GBM treatment is currently under\nevaluation in combination with other BBTB penetration techniques\nbut showed limited in vivo efﬁcacy40,41. We demonstrated that\noptoBBTB increased Taxol delivery to both GEMMs at doses that sig-\nniﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth by reducing tumor cell prolifera-\ntion and inducing cell death, which further prolonged the survival of\nTotal radiant efficiency (×109,\n[p/s]/[µm/cm²])\n5\n15\n10\n0\noptoBBTB+Vehicle\noptoBBTB+Taxol\nTaxol\nVehicle\nP=0.0079\n120\n0\n80\n40\n100\n60\n20\n10\nDPI\nSurvival rate (%)\n20\n30\n40\nP=0.0012\nP<0.0001\nP=0.0006\nTumor volume (mm³)\n50\n0\n100\n150\nP<0.0001\n0\n0\n40\n60\n80\n0.05\nTaxol coverage (%)\n0.1\nP<0.0001\nP<0.0001\nmargin\ncore\nP=0.2051\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\nTaxol concentration (ng/g)\nP=0.0039\nP=0.0032\nTumor\nTransplantation\ng\n3 Treatments\nMRI and \nHistological\nAnalysis\n4-12 dpi\n3 dpi\ni\np\nd\n5\n1\ni\np\nd\n0\nMRI\n73C solid tumor treatment\nP<0.0001\nP<0.0001\nP<0.0001\n0\n40\n50\n% TUNEL positive cells\n30\n2\n20\n4\nP=0.0261\nP=0.0005\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n4\n8\n12\nDPI\nBody weight (g)\n15\noptoBBTB+Taxol\nVehicle\nTaxol\noptoBBTB+Vehicle\nn.s.\nb\na\nHOE/GFP/Taxol646\noptoBBTB (-) \nmargin\noptoBBTB (+) \nmargin\noptoBBTB (+) \ncore\noptoBBTB (-) \ncore\nd\nc\nf\ne\ni\nOptoBBTB+Vehicle\nTaxol\nlo\nx\na\nT\n+\nB\nT\nB\nB\no\nt\np\nO\nelcih\ne\nV\nHOE\nKi67+\nTUNEL+\nh\nEpi-fluorescence (×109)\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\nColor scale\nMin: 1.11×108\nMax: 2.12×109\nVehicle\nTaxol\nOptoBBTB+Vehicle\nOptoBBTB+Taxol\nj\nP<0.0001\nP<0.0001\nP<0.0001\n% Ki67 positive cells\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\n20\nk\nl\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40579-1\nNature Communications|   (2023) 14:4934 \n10\n\ntumor-bearing mice without causing adverse effects. These results\ndemonstrate that optoBBTB is effective for drug delivery and GBM\ntreatment in two preclinical GEMMs. One limitation of our current\nstudy is that we tested the treatment using GEMMs in immunodeﬁcient\nmice. It is important to further assess the efﬁcacy of optoBBTB in\nimmunocompetent models.\nThere is increasing recognition that one signiﬁcant factor con-\ntributing to limited progress in identifying more effective therapies for\nGBM is the reliance on preclinical models, which fail to fully recapi-\ntulate GBM pathophysiology18. GBM is characterized by a high degree\nof spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Driven by high levels of angiogenic\nsignals, GBM cells can induce microvascular proliferation in the tumor\ncore regions, which are irregular structures with poor hemodynamics\nand limited function42. On the other hand, GBM cells at the tumor\nmargin are characterized by diffuse single-cell inﬁltration through the\nbrain parenchyma, including neuron-rich regions of gray matter neu-\nropil and along white matter tracts43,44. Here, GBM cells co-opt the pre-\nexisting dense brain microvasculature for metabolic support and\nnutrient exchange without disrupting the normal structure or func-\ntions of the microvessels45–47. To this end, we utilized two genetically\nengineered GBM cell lines (PS5A1 and 73 C) to establish GEMMs. PS5A1\nmodel has an inﬁltrative growth pattern with vessel co-option devel-\nopment, and the 73 C model recapitulates GBM features such as an\nangiogenic tumor core and intratumoral heterogeneity in terms of\nBBTB function and TJ composition. To generate a mouse glioma, it\ntypically requires the activation of an oncogene (e.g., EGFR mutation,\nPDGFRa, cMET, BrafV600E) in combination with loss of one or more\nsuppressors (PTENf/f, P53f/f, and INK4a/b−/−Arf f/f). Our GEMMs include\nloss of critical tumor suppressor genes (PTEN−/−and P53−/−; or PTEN−/−\nand INK4ab/Arf−/−) that are seen in virtually all human GBM. While the\nBrafV600E activating mutation is only seen in 5–7% of adult gliomas and\nis one of the most common mutations in pediatric gliomas, it is known\nto be a powerful activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK)/ERK signaling pathways, which is almost ubiquitously acti-\nvated by any number of mutations (e.g., NF1 loss, EGFR mutations).\nThus, in combination with PTEN loss, leading to activation of the\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway, our GEMMs are\ndriven by a powerful co-activation of both the AKT and ERK signaling\npathways which are ubiquitously activated in GBM30. In addition, one\nof the major advantages of our combination of mutations is that while\nthere is signiﬁcant diversity of oncogenes that are seen in GBM which\nhas inﬂuenced the choice of mutations that are selected to generate\nGEM models48–51, they share one common important feature that they\nall to some extent activate a common downstream RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK\nsignaling pathway, which in turn regulates transcriptional networks to\ndrive tumorigenesis. NF1 loss leads to RAS activation (product of NF1 is\na negative regulator of RAS), while the BrafV600E constitutively activates\nRAF which is directly downstream from RAS. As noted above, the\nBrafV600E is one of the most common activating mutations inall cancers,\nimplying that it is capable of activating a critical regulatory step in the\nprocess of malignant transformation. Taken together, we suggest that\nour GEMMs represent a relevant in vivo model system for testing drug\ndelivery following BBTB disruption.\nOptoBBTB opens avenues of therapeutic interventions for GBM\npatients. Since the intercellular TJs represent a formidable barrier\nagainst paracellular drug delivery at the BBB13,52, approaches have been\ndeveloped to modulate the TJ to enhance the delivery across the BBB,\nincluding co-administration of siRNA against claudin-5 and occludin,\nas well as exploiting claudins or cadherin inhibitory peptides53–56.\nHowever, a lack of a robust delivery system in humans, poor targeting\nefﬁcacy, or a lack of site-speciﬁcity impedes the successful translation\nof these approaches. Here we demonstrated that optoBBTB speciﬁ-\ncally targeted the JAM-A component of the TJ to modulate the BBTB\nlocally and reversibly, and multiple openings could be achieved for\nanticancer drug delivery. Compared with the above-mentioned TJ\nmodulation approaches, optoBBTB demonstrates advantages such as\nhigh targeting efﬁciency and site-speciﬁcity. Focused ultrasound (FUS)\nwith circulating microbubbles (MB) is an emerging approach to\nmodulate\nBBB\npermeability\nnon-invasively\nand\nreversibly16,57.\nOptoBBTB is a complementary approach and offers the feasibility to\ntune the laser beam size, enabling BBB modulation in larger or\nsmaller areas.\nAlthough modulation of the BBB permeability using the laser\nwith/without\nplasmonic\nnanoparticles\nhas\nbeen\nreported\nelsewhere58–60, our method has three critical differences compared to\nthese strategies. First, our AuNP-BV11 nanoparticles bind to the vas-\nculature, and the optoBBB modulation approach involves the increase\nof paracellular permeability without causing damage to the blood\nvessels and junctional proteins under the conditions investigated in\nthis work. It is worth noticing that these changes were assessed 30 min\nafter optoBBTB, and further examination should be conducted at\nlonger time points to obtain a comprehensive assessment. Second,\noptoBBTB exploits nanoscale mechanical perturbation rather than the\nheating effect61. Since the duty cycle of the laser is low, the amount of\nheat dissipated from the nanoparticle into the surrounding medium is\ninsufﬁcient to raise tissue temperature. Last, since our control group\n(optoBBTB+Vehicle) did not show a reduction of tumor volume or an\nincreased survival rate, and the local temperature was not enhanced\nafter laser excitation, we believe that the reduced tumor volume is\nmainly mediated by the extravasation of Taxol rather than by other\nmechanisms such as the heating effect. Recently, we revealed the\nmechanisms of the optical BBB modulation using an in vitro BBB\nmodel established with human cerebral microvascular endothelial\ncells. We showed that the picosecond laser excitation of vascular-\ntargeting AuNPs produced nanoscale mechanical perturbation, which\ntriggers several mechanobiological responses that lead to an increased\nparacellular permeability35. While it may contribute to the increased\ndrug accumulation in tumor after optoBBTB, further work is warranted\nto investigate the BBTB opening mechanisms in the current models.\nWe compared the optoBBTB in these two GEMMs regarding\nnanoparticle targeting and the BBTB opening efﬁciency. Our results\nshow that after nanoparticle administration, there was a signiﬁcantly\nFig. 6 | OptoBBTB improves therapeutic outcomes in the angiogenic 73 C\nGEMM. a Schematic illustration of the treatment timeline.

Therefore, the different blood vessel phenotypes\nmight inﬂuence the nanoparticle binding efﬁciency, probably due to\nthe increased JAM-A expression in the angiogenic 73 C GEMM. How-\never, our results show that optoBBTB in PS5A1 GEMM was more efﬁ-\ncient than in 73 C GEMM, regardless of the nanoparticle targets, for\nexample increasing Taxol delivery by 16-fold vs 5-fold in these two\nmodels, respectively. We hypothesize that the blood vessel pheno-\ntypes may also respond differently to the mechanobiological activa-\ntion\nof\nthe\nBBB35.\nTherefore,\nPS5A1\nGEMM\nwith\nnormal\nmicrovasculature might demonstrate a higher optoBBTB efﬁciency\nthan angiogenic 73 C GEMM. Additional research is necessary to\nexplore the impact of the vascular phenotype on optoBBTB.\nOptoBBTB presents opportunities for further investigations. The\n532 nm light exploited in the current study enables light delivery to the\nmouse cortex, and therefore, our method can be useful as a drug\ndevelopment and screening platform (optoBBTB and GEMMs) for\ntesting a class of potent anticancer drugs for superﬁcial tumors. Sev-\neral approaches can be exploited to further advance the technique,\nsuch as utilizing near-infrared laser and near-infrared light absorbing\nnanoparticles to improve the light penetration depth in the tissue, or\nusing optical ﬁber in the tumor surgical cavity for light delivery into\ndeeper brain regions.\nIn conclusion, we proposed a brain tumor treatment strategy\nexploiting optoBBTB for drug delivery in clinically relevant GEMMs.\nOur work on the GBM intratumoral heterogeneity analysis and the\nGEMMs development has broad implications, as there is signiﬁcant\ninterest in developing and translating technologies on BBB modulation\nfor brain tumor treatment using various modalities. Furthermore, our\ninvestigation shows that BBTB modulation beneﬁts brain tumor\ntreatment and opens up avenues to test a class of potent anticancer\ndrugs by combining with strategies to increase brain permeability.\nThese lines of investigation will bring perspectives and build a solid\npreclinical foundation for future investigations in brain tumor\ntreatment.\nMethods\nApprovals and authorizations\nAnimal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use\nCommittee (IACUC) of the University of Texas at Dallas.

Mouse sex was\nnot considered in the study design.\nHuman GBM sample\nFresh brain tumor samples were obtained from adult patients during\ntheir operative procedure after informed consent was obtained. Brain\ntumors were graded, and tumor core and tumor margin were also\ndeﬁned by T2-weighted ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)\nimaging of the patient’s brain, at the Southwestern Medical Centre,\nUniversity of Texas, by a neuropathologist according to World Health\nOrganization guidelines. In this study, we aim to use the patient data to\nshow the intratumoral BBTB heterogeneity and the tumor recurrence\nat the inﬁltrative and intact tumor margin, to emphasis the necessity\nfor BBTB opening and drug delivery in this region. Since we did not\nchoose the genes to modify based on this patient data, the patient’s\nWHO classiﬁcation, and underlying tumor genetics are not relevant\ninformation for this study design.\nGlioma cell line and cell culture\nPS5A1 and 73 C glioma cells were generated from Dr. Robert Bachoo’s\nlaboratory29,30. PS5A1 is a highly invasive mouse glioma cell line derived\nfrom de novo glioma in the adult BL6 background conditional mouse\n(LSL.BrafV600E f/+; INK4a/b.Arff/f; PTENf/f) that was induced by intracranial\ninjection of AAV5-GFAP-Cre-GFP. 73 C glioma cells were generated in\nprimary astrocyte cultures from neonatal mice that carried conditional\nmutations for PTENf/f, P53f/f, and LSL.BrafV600E f/+. These cells were\nderived from conditional multi-allele primary astrocytes and infected\nex vivo with an adeno-Cre virus to generate a primary transformed cell\nline. The transient infection with the adenovirus infects nearly 100% of\nthe cells (veriﬁed by ﬂuorescent GFP), which ensures the expression of\nCre-protein (CMV promoter-driven) and a complete excision of the\nLSL-stop codon to activate the mutant BrafV600E from its endogenous\npromoter. Since the AAV transduction provides a transient GFP\nexpression, these cells were further infected with Lenti-GFP and\nselected by puromycin for stable green ﬂuorescent protein expression.\nPS5A1 cells were cultured as free-ﬂoating neurospheres in DMEM/\nF12 medium, 2% of B-27, 20 ng/mL of EGF, and 20 ng/mL of FGF2,\n20 ng/mL progesterone, and 1% insulin transferrin solution. 73 C\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40579-1\nNature Communications|   (2023) 14:4934 \n12\n\nglioma cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS) and 1% penicillin-Streptomycin.\nBoth cell lines used in this study were free of mycoplasma con-\ntamination (Lonza’s MycoAlert® Mycoplasma Detection Assays). We\nroutinely test the cell cultures when revived from liquid nitrogen sto-\nrage and again repeat testing if cells maintained continually for\n>30 days.\nIn vitro dose responses\n3000 cells in 100 µL of cell culture medium were seeded in each well of\nthe 96-well plate. A day later, 100 µL of taxol solution (0-1000 nM) was\nadded to each well, and the solution was gently mixed and incubated in\na CO2 incubator (37 °C) for 72 h. Then the cell viability was measured\nusing WST-1 assay and reading the absorbance at 450 nm. The effect of\nthe vehicle (Cremophor® EL and ethanol) was excluded by incubating\nthe cells with the vehicle, and the absorbance at 450 nm was sub-\nstituted from the reading.\nIn vitro cellular uptake of ﬂuorescent Taxol\nGlioma cells were seeded in a glass-bottom culture dish (35 mm petri\ndish with 10 mm microwell) with a density of 70000 cells/cm2. One day\nlater, Taxol Janelia Fluor® 646 was added to the dish to achieve a ﬁnal\nconcentration of 3 µM, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. Then cells\nwere washed and ﬁxed with 4% PFA for 10 min. The cell nuclei were\nstained with Hoechst staining for 10 min. Finally, the cells were washed\nthree times with PBS before imaging.\nGlioma cell transplantation\nAll glioma cells used for transplantation were passaged 2 days before\ntransplantation to reach 70–80% conﬂuence. The glioma cells were\ndissociated and resuspended in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (without\nCa2+, Mg2+, HBSS). Cells were counted, and a suspension was prepared\nwith a density of 2 × 105/µL.\nBuprenorphine (1 mg/kg) was given to the mice subcutaneously\nbefore surgery. 368 nL of PS5A1 glioma cell or 92 nL of 73 C glioma cell\nsuspension in HBSS was constantly injected into the mouse cortex\n(−1 mm, −1 mm, 0.5 mm) using a nanoinjector (World Precision\nInstrument) equipped with a glass micropipette. The glass micropip-\nette has a 50 µm tip and was generated by a Micropipette Puller (P-\n1000, Sutter Instrument Co.). After injection, a thin layer of glue was\napplied over the exposed skull and the surrounding skin, and a layer of\nbody double (Body Double™Standard Set, Smooth-On, Inc.) was\napplied to the skull for protection. The mice were housed for 3 days\n(73 C) to 2 weeks (PS5A1) to allow tumor growth before starting the\nexperiments. The animal ethics guidelines of the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas at Dallas\nwere strictly followed, ensuring that the mouse was euthanized upon\nreaching either when its brain tumor surpassed the predetermined\nmaximum volume of 1 cm3 or when its weight loss exceeded 20%.\nDye permeability experiment\nEZ-link biotin (660 Da, 2 mg/mL) and Evans Blue (66 kDa/albumin-\nbound, 2% w/v) were intravenously injected into two tumor-bearing\nmice at (1) 14-, 28- and 42 dpi for PS5A1 GEMM, and (2) 7-, 14- and 21 dpi\nfor 73 C GEMM. 30 min after the dye injection, the mice were sacriﬁced\nby cervical dislocation, and the brains were extracted and post-ﬁxed in\n4% (w/v) PFA at 4 °C for 24 h. The brains were then snap-frozen on dry\nice and cut into 20 µm thick coronal slices using a cryostat. The slices\nwere stained with cy3-streptavidin to detect biotin and Hoechst solu-\ntion to label nuclei before imaging.\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining\nTo immunostain vascular biomarker (CD31) and junctional proteins\n(i.e., Claudin-5, ZO-1, VE-cadherin, Occludin, and JAM-A), the mice\nbrains were snap-frozen on dry ice once quickly removed from the\nskull and cut to 20 μm thick coronal slices on a cryostat. To analyze the\ninﬂuence of optoBBTB on vessel density and the immunoﬂuorescence\nof the junctional proteins, the brains were collected at 30 min after the\noptoBBTB, followed by cryosectioned to 20 μm thick coronal slices.\nThe brain slices were ﬁxed for 10 min using ice-cold methanol at\n−20 °C. Blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100\nin PBS) was applied to the tissue for 1 h at room temperature. After\nwashing, the sections were ﬁrst incubated overnight at 4 °C with the\nfollowing primary antibodies: (1) rat anti-CD31, rabbit anti-Claudin-5,\nrabbit anti-ZO-1, rabbit anti-VE-cadherin, rabbit anti-Occludin, or (2)\ngoat anti-CD31 and rat anti-JAM-A (BV12). The antibody dilution ratio\nwas 1:500 in PBS, and 1 mL of the antibody solution was applied to\n10–12 brain slices.\nTo immunostain transferrin receptor and vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) or to detect cell proliferation after\ntreatment, the mice were perfused with PBS and 4% PFA. The brains\nwere extracted and post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA overnight, then cut into 20 μm\nthick coronal slices on a cryostat. The slices were incubated in applied\nto the tissue for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with\nprimary antibodies (1) goat anti-CD31, rat anti-Transferrin (8D3), rat\nanti-VEGFR2, or (2) rabbit anti-ki67 with a dilution ratio of 1:500 in PBS.\n1 mL of the antibody solution was applied to 10–12 brain slices.\nIn all cases, the sections were then incubated with secondary\nantibodies (the dilution ratio was 1:500 in PBS) for 2 h at room tem-\nperature, followed by Hoechst solution (the dilution ratio was 1:2000\nin PBS). 1 mL of the antibody solution or Hoechst solution was applied\nto 10–12 brain slices. The slides were washed with PBS and mounted\nwith Fluoromount-G mounting medium for imaging.\nThe preparation of brain vascular-targeting gold nanoparticles\nand control gold nanoparticles\nThe method to prepare brain vascular-targeting gold nanoparticles\n(AuNPs-BV11) was adapted from our previously reported method17. The\n50 nm AuNPs were synthesized via seed-mediated growth starting\nfrom 15 nm gold seeds. To synthesize the seeds, 98 mL of ultrapure\nwater was added to a 250 mL glass ﬂask that was cleaned with aqua\nregia and rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water. 1 mL of gold chloride\nsolution (25 mM) was added to the ﬂask. The solution was boiled, and\n1 mL of trisodium citrate solution (112.2 mM) was added under vigor-\nous stirring. The nanoparticles were boiled and stirred for 10 min, then\ncooled to room temperature. To synthesize 50 nm AuNP, 94 mL of\nultrapure water was added to a 250 mL glass ﬂask, followed by the\nsequential addition of 963 µL of gold chloride solution (25 mM), 3.7 mL\nof seeds (2.2 nM), 963 µL of trisodium citrate (15 mM) and 963 µL of\nhydroquinone (25 mM) under vigorous stirring. The resulting nano-\nparticles were stirred at room temperature overnight, and con-\ncentrated for further use. To prepare brain vascular-targeted AuNPs,\nBV11 (anti-JAM-A antibody) was diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in PBS, and then\ndiluted in 2 mM ice-cold borate buffer (pH 8.5) to 0.05 mg/mL. OPSS-\nPEG-SVA was dissolved in 2 mM borate buffer and mixed with the BV11\nantibody at a 125:1 molar ratio. The solution was incubated for 3 h on\nice, followed by dialysis at 4 °C overnight using a 20 kDa MWCO\nmembrane. The thiolated BV11 antibodies were then collected and\nmixed with the concentrated AuNPs at a 200:1 molar ratio, and incu-\nbated for 1 h on ice. To stabilize AuNP-BV11, mPEG-thiol (1 kDa) was\nadded at 6 PEG/nm2 and incubated for 1 h on ice. Finally, the modiﬁed\nAuNPs were washed three times with ice-cold borate buffer. AuNP-TfR\nand AuNP-VEGFR2 were prepared using a similar approach by repla-\ncing BV11 with the anti-TfR antibody and anti-VEGFR2 antibody. The\ncontrol nanoparticles were prepared by incubating 50 nm AuNP with\nmPEG-thiol (PEG: polyethylene glycol, 1 kDa) with a thiol: AuNP=300:1\nmolar ratio for 3 h on ice. The particles were washed three times in\nborate buffer. The concentration, size distribution, and morphology of\nthe nanoparticles were analyzed by Ultraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared\nabsorption spectra with Gen5 software for BioTek Synergy 2 plate\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40579-1\nNature Communications|   (2023) 14:4934 \n13\n\nreader, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) with Malvern Zetasizer soft-\nware, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with Gatan\nDigitalMicrograph.\nOptoBBTB optimization in GEMMs\nThe tumor-bearing mouse was anesthetized by 2–3% isoﬂurane (in air)\nand intravenously administrated AuNP-BV11. 1 h later, the body double\non the scalp was peeled off to expose the skull. One pulse of the\npicosecond (ps) laser was applied to the tumor region through the\nintact skull. To optimize the BBTB modulation to achieve the highest\nopening efﬁciency, different nanoparticle doses and laser ﬂuence\nconditions were tested with PS5A1 and 73 C GEMMs, as shown in\nSupplementary Table 1, 3. Evans blue dye (2% in PBS, 100 µL) and EZ-\nlink biotin (2 mg/mL, 100 µL) was injected to visualize the BBTB mod-\nulation. 30 min after the laser excitation, the mice were perfused with\nPBS and 4% PFA, and the brains were extracted and post-ﬁxed with PFA\novernight. The brains were frozen on dry ice and cut into 20 µm thick\nslices using a cryostat. The slices were stained with cy3-streptavidin to\ndetect biotin before imaging.\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\nWe used ICP-MS to measure the AuNP-BV11 accumulation in PS5A1\nGEMM (14 dpi) after each optoBBTB (40 mJ/cm2, 1 pulse, repeated\nthree times at 14, 18, and 22 dpi, nanoparticle administration dose was\n18.5 µg/g). We also studied the nanoparticle degradation proﬁle using\nhealthy Nu/J mice. The mice received three nanoparticle injections and\nlaser treatments at 3 days intervals, and the gold concentration in each\norgan was measured 60 days after the third nanoparticle injection and\nlaser excitation. ICP-MS was also used to determine the biodistribution\nof AuNP-BV11 (37 µg/g) after intravenous (i.v.) injection to the 73 C\nglioma-bearing mice (7 dpi). 1 h after the nanoparticle injection, the\nmice were perfused with ice-cold PBS, and the main organs were col-\nlected. The tissue was then digested in fresh aqua regia until the tissue\nwas fully dissolved. Then the solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for\n10 min, and the supernatant was collected and diluted with ultrapure\nwater for ICP-MS analysis with Agilent 7900 and MassHunter Software.\nAnalysis of the BBTB opening window after laser excitation of\nAuNP-BV11\nAuNP-BV11 (18.5 µg/g or 37 µg/g) was i.v. injected to PS5A1 and 73 C\nGEMMs at 14 and 7 dpi, respectively (N = 3 mice for each group, namely\nmouse 1-3). The mice received a picosecond laser pulse (40 mJ/cm2)\nafter 1 h. Then EZ-link biotin was injected immediately after laser\nexcitation (mouse 1) or after 1 (mouse 2) or 3 days (mouse 3). 30 min\nafter the dye injection, the brains were extracted and frozen on dry ice\nand cut into 20 µm thick slices using a cryostat. The brain slices were\nincubated with Cy3-streptavidin to detect biotin and Hoechst solution\nto stain cell nuclei. The biotin leakage was imaged using Olympus\nVS120 virtual slide microscope with a 10x objective.\nLocal temperature measurement before and after optoBBTB\nWe used a FLIR ONE Thermal Imaging Camera for smartphones to\nmeasure the temperature change in the laser-irradiated region on the\nmouse’s skull. The temperature before and after laser excitation was\nrecorded using Vernier Thermal Analysis™Plus. Brieﬂy, a region of\ninterest (ROI) that covered the laser irradiation region was manually\nselected on the app. We recorded a temperature baseline (1 min), fol-\nlowed by applying the laser (40 mJ/cm2, 1 pulse), and then recorded\ncontinuously for 4 min.\nFluorescent Taxol delivery to the tumor after optoBBTB\nAuNP-BV11 (18.5 µg/g and 37 µg/g for PS5A1 and 73 C GEMMs, respec-\ntively) was i.v. injected into a tumor-bearing mouse (14 and 7 dpi,\nrespectively). 1 h later, the mouse received a single pulse of ps laser\n(40 mJ/cm2), followed by Taxol Janelia Fluor® 646 (12.5 mg/kg) i.v.\nadministration. 30 min after laser excitation, the mouse was perfused\nwith PBS and 4% PFA, and the brain was extracted and then post-ﬁxed\nin 4% PFA overnight. The brain was frozen on dry ice and cut into 20 µm\nthick slices using a cryostat. The slices were stained with Hoechst to\nlabel the nuclei.\nGlioma treatment after optoBBTB\nThe treatment for PS5A1 GEMM was started at 14 dpi. The mice were\nrandomly divided into four groups: (1) vehicle control; (2) free Taxol\ncontrol (12.5 mg/kg); (3) optoBBTB+vehicle; (4) optoBBTB+Taxol\n(12.5 mg/kg) with ﬁve animals in each group. Speciﬁcally, Taxol was\ndissolved in a mixer of Cremophor EL: absolute ethanol (1:1 v/v, as the\nvehicle) to 6 mg/mL and then diluted to 2 mg/mL with saline. 18.5 µg/g\nof the AuNP-BV11 was i.v. injected into the tumor-bearing mouse.\n1 h later, the mice received picosecond-laser excitation (40 mJ/cm2,\n1 pulse, pulse duration was 28 ps and beam size was 6 mm) in the\ntumor area, followed by receiving either vehicle or Taxol via i.v.\ninjection. The treatment was repeated every 4 days and repeated three\ntimes. The mice were sacriﬁced at 42 dpi to analyze the tumor size.\nFor 73 C GEMM, the treatment was started on 4 dpi. The same\ntreatment groups were used. To modulate the BBTB, 37 µg/g of the\nAuNP-BV11 was i.v. injected into the tumor-bearing mice. 1 h later, the\nmice received picosecond laser excitation (40 mJ/cm2, 1 pulse) fol-\nlowed by either vehicle or Taxol via i.v. injection. The treatment was\nrepeated every 4 days. Three treatments were conducted between\n4–12 dpi. On 3 and 15 dpi, the tumor size atthe start point and endpoint\nwas measured by MRI (T2-weighted scan).\nSimilar treatment groups were used for PS5A1 and 73 C GEMMs to\nobtain the survival rate, with 7 mice in each group. The tumor-bearing\nmice were euthanized if they developed weight loss (>20%), loss of\ngrooming, seizures, and focal motor deﬁcits according to the\napproved animal protocol.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n73 C glioma was visualized using a preclinical BioSpec 3 T MRI (Bruker,\nBillerica, MA, USA) with a mouse head coil (Item RF Res 128 1H 064/023\nQSN TF, Model 1 P T167055, Serial S0013) with Paravision 360. T2-\nweighted scans were performed using a T2 RARE sequence with an\necho time of 60 ms, repetition time of 2725.738 ms, an echo spacing of\n15 ms, a rare factor of 10, 8 averages, 1 repetition, a slice thickness of\n0.5 mm, a ﬁeld of view of 20 by 20 mm, and a matrix size of 192 by 192.\nThe number of slices ranged from 12 to 20 to cover the entire brain of\neach mouse. Images were exported to Digital Imaging and Commu-\nnications in Medicine (DICOMs) and used Fiji/Image-J and ITK-SNAP for\nfurther analysis.\nIn situ cell apoptosis detection\nThe cell apoptosis analysis was performed at 42 dpi (20 days after the\n3rd treatment) or 15 dpi (3 days after the 3rd treatment) for PS5A1 and\n73 C GEMMs, respectively. The mice were perfused with PBS and PFA,\nand the mice’s brains were harvested and post-ﬁxed in PFA overnight.\nThen the brains were snap-freeze on dry ice. 30 µm thick brain slices\nwere cut on a cryostat, and the cell apoptosis detection was per-\nformed with ApopTag® Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit following\nthe manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, the slides were rinsed in two\nchanges of PBS (5 min each) and post-ﬁxed in pre-cooled ethanol:\nacetic acid 2:1 for 5 min at −20 °C, followed by rinsing twice in PBS.\nThen equilibration buffer (75 µL/5 cm2) was applied to the specimen\nand incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Then the excess liquid\nwas removed, and the TdT enzyme was applied to the samples (55 µL/\n5 cm2), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, stop/\nwash buffer was added to the samples and incubated for 10 min at\nroom temperature. The samples were washed three times in PBS, and\nanti-digoxigenin conjugate rhodamine was applied to the specimen\n(65 µL/5 cm2) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.

The transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-2010\nmicroscope.\nTo measure the tumor size after treatment, the brains were\nextracted and imaged the GFP ﬂuorescent using IVIS® Lumina III In\nVivo Imaging System. The radiant efﬁciency was measured with\nLiving Image® Software. To image the dye or Taxol extravasation\nafter optoBBTB, the samples were imaged with a 10x objective\n(Olympus VS120 virtual slide microscope) or 100x oil immersion\nobjective (Olympus SD-OSR spinning disk super-resolution micro-\nscope). To study the changes in junctional proteins using IHC\nstaining, the samples were imaged with a 100x oil immersion\nobjective (Olympus SD-OSR spinning disk super-resolution micro-\nscope). Then the images were analyzed by Fiji/ImageJ. The area\nfraction of Claudin-5, ZO-1, VE-cadherin, Occludin, and JAMA-A was\nobtained and normalized by CD31 (indicating cerebral vessel). To\nstudy the vasculature density, the images were acquired using a 10x\nobjective (Olympus SD-OSR spinning disk super-resolution micro-\nscope). The vasculature density was analyzed by area fraction of\nCD31 or lectin. The ki67 and TUNEL staining were imaged with a\n100x oil immersion objective (Olympus SD-OSR spinning disk\nsuper-resolution microscope). The image acquisition settings were\nkept constant during the experiment.\nTo obtain the tumor volume after treatment in PS5A1 GEMM,\ncoronal brain slices (30 µm) were imaged with Olympus VS120 virtual\nslide microscope with a 10x objective. The image acquisition settings\nwere kept constant between the samples. A threshold was set to cover\nthe tumor areas using Fiji/Image-J (exempliﬁed in Supplementary\nFig. 11b), consistent across all brain slices analyzed. Therefore, the total\ntumor area can be measured using Fiji/Image-J. And the tumor volume\ncan thus be determined by the product of total area and slice\nthickness.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.\nNo data were excluded from the analyses. The survival time was\nanalyzed by logrank test, other data were analyzed by one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple com-\nparisons test and unpaired Student’s two-sided t-test for two\ncomparisons.\nFor in vitro experiment, six replicates were performed. For\nin vivo experiment, at least two independent experiments were\nperformed. We used G*power analysis to calculate the sample sizes\nfor tumor size and survival analysis. The effect size was obtained\nfrom our preliminary study. With 85% power, and alpha set to 0.05,\nthe sample size required was calculated as N = 5 per group. The mice\nwere randomly assigned to different experimental groups with no\nbias for further treatment. The investigators were not blinded to\nallocation during experiments and outcome assessment since the\ntreatment groups were obvious from the result. The N values per\ngroup and details of statistical testing are provided in the ﬁgure\ncaption.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nAll data associated with this study are in the paper or the Supple-\nmentary Materials.

However, developmental processes of these unique structures\nhave been poorly described. BELL1-like homeobox (BLH) transcription factors (TFs) are known to heterodimerize with\nKNOTTED1-like homeobox TFs to play crucial roles in shoot meristem maintenance, but their functions are elusive in\nmonocots. We found that maize (Zea mays) BLH12 and BLH14 have redundant but important roles in stem development.\nBLH12/14 interact with KNOTTED1 (KN1) in vivo and accumulate in overlapping domains in shoot meristems, young stems,\nand provascular bundles. Similar to kn1 loss-of-function mutants, blh12 blh14 (blh12/14) double mutants fail to maintain\naxillary meristems. Unique to blh12/14 is an abnormal tassel branching and precocious internode differentiation that results in\ndwarﬁsm and reduced veins in stems. Micro-computed tomography observation of vascular networks revealed that blh12/14\ndouble mutants had reduced vein number due to fewer intermediate veins in leaves and precocious anastomosis in young\nstems. Based on these results, we propose two functions of BLH12/14 during stem development: (1) maintaining intercalary\nmeristems that accumulate KN1 and prevent precocious internode differentiation and (2) preventing precocious anastomosis\nof provascular bundles in young stems to ensure the production of sufﬁcient independent veins.\nINTRODUCTION\nPlantarchitectureresultsfromtherepeatedproductionoflateralorgans\nfrom the shoot apex in coordination with growth of the stem, a cylin-\ndricalsupportingstructurebeneaththeshootapex.Growthofthestem\nseparates the lateral organs, allowing for more efﬁcient light reception\nand gas exchange. Stems also provide mechanical support, which is\nparticularly enhanced by the rigid, ligniﬁed cells in the vascular system\nthat connects water-absorbing roots with photosynthetic aerial\norgans. In crop species, regulation of stem elongation is particularly\nimportant because of its impact on potential yield loss due to lodging.\nThus, stem growth has been a major target of crop improvement as\nexempliﬁed by semidwarf mutations in the phytohormone gibberellin\npathway that were utilized in the green revolution (Hedden, 2003).\nDespite the importance, however, developmental processes of stems\nand its underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized.\nStem growth occurs in an interrupted pattern between initiating\nleaves.The region ofgrowthisreferred toastheinternode,whereas\nthe node is the site of leaf attachment. From clonal analysis, it\nappears that the node and the subtending internode arise from the\nsame pool of cells (Johri and Coe, 1983). Growth in the internode is\nbasipetalinmostspecies(Kaplan,2000).Thisgrowthpatternplaces\nthe meristematic zone of one internode, called the intercalary\nmeristem, just above the node of the subtending leaf.\nMonocotyledonous plants are named for the difference in their\nembryonic leaves but are also distinguished by their stem venation\npattern. Dicotyledonous plants have the vascular cambium and\nproducearingofvasculature,known asaeustele,withthexylemon\nthe inside and phloem on the outside. Monocots lack the vascular\ncambium and instead have what is referred to as a scattered ve-\nnation pattern (or atactostele) (Sanchez et al., 2012). Monocots and\ndicots also differ in how veins enter from leaves into stems. In\na typical dicot leaf, the reticulate venation coalesces into a major\nvein that enters into the stem and anastomoses with the ring of\nvasculature. In many monocots, but speciﬁcally in grasses, the\nparallel veins of the leaf each enter into the stem without co-\nalescence and become individual veins that are scattered in the\nstem. This venation pattern in monocots provides a unique op-\nportunity to study the mechanism that regulates vein anastomosis.\nThree amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain tran-\nscription factors (TFs) are conserved throughout eukaryotes and\nhave essential roles in diverse developmental contexts (Bürglin\nand Affolter, 2016; Tsuda and Hake, 2015). In plants, TALE TFs\nare classiﬁed into two subfamilies, KNOTTED1-like homeobox\n1 These authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 Address correspondence to hake@berkeley.edu.\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the ﬁndings\npresented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the\nInstructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Sarah Hake (hake@\nberkeley.edu).\nOPENArticles can be viewed without a subscription.\nwww.plantcell.org/cgi/doi/10.1105/tpc.16.00967\nThe Plant Cell, Vol. 29: 1105–1118, May 2017, www.plantcell.org ã 2017 ASPB.\n\n(KNOX) and BELL1-like homeobox (BLH). KNOX and BLH pro-\nteins interact to produce functional heterodimers most famously\ndemonstrated by their role in zygote development in Chlamydo-\nmonas reinhardtii (Lee et al., 2008). In ﬂowering plants such as\nArabidopsis thaliana, BLH genes are involved in various de-\nvelopmental processes including shoot meristem maintenance,\nlateral organ patterning, and carpel development (Reiser et al.,\n1995; Kumar et al., 2007; Rutjens et al., 2009; Byrne et al., 2003;\nBhatt et al., 2004; Roeder et al., 2003; Smith and Hake, 2003).\nHowever, their function in monocot species has not been\ndescribed.\nWe investigated the maize (Zea mays) homologs of Arabidopsis\nPENNYWISE, BLH12 and BLH14. Both proteins interact with KN1\nand accumulate in shoot meristems, young stems, intercalary\nmeristems, and provascular bundles. The double mutants lacked\ntillers and ears and had highly branched tassels. Strikingly, the\nintercalary meristems failed to be maintained and the stem pro-\nvascular bundles precociously anastomosed, indicating impor-\ntant roles for TALE TFs in vasculature and internode patterning in\nthe stem.\nRESULTS\nMaize PNY homologs, BLH12 and BLH14, Interact with KN1\nEighteen BLH proteins were identiﬁed from database searches\nin the maize genome. Phylogenetic analysis using an additional\n13 BLHs from Arabidopsis identiﬁed three maize proteins,\nBLH12, BLH13, and BLH14, as close homologs of Arabidopsis\nPENNYWISE (PNY) (Figure 1A). Similar to PNY, all three maize\ngenes are expressed at high levels in shoot meristems including\nthe shoot apical meristem (SAM), young tassels, and ears and\nat lower levels in leaves (Supplemental Figure 1). Given that\nblh13 expression level is relatively low compared with the other\ntwo genes, our analysis focuses on blh12 and blh14.\nMutator (Mu) insertions were obtained for blh12 and blh14. The\ninsertions are in the 59 untranslated region, exon 2, and exon 4 in\nblh12-1, blh12-3, and blh12-2, respectively (Figure 1B). An im-\nmunoblot using an anti-BLH12 antibody revealed that the accu-\nmulation of BLH12 protein in the vegetative shoot apex was lost in\nblh12-1 and blh12-3 and greatly reduced in blh12-2 (Figure 1C).\nSimilarly, an immunoblot using an anti-BLH14 antibody did not\ndetect BLH14 protein in shoot apices of blh14-1, which contains\na Mu insertion inexon 1 of blh14. Thus, these Muinsertion lines are\nloss-of-function mutants of BLH12 and BLH14.\nPNY\ninteracts\nwith\nthe\nArabidopsis\nKNOX\nprotein\nSHOOTMERISTEMLESS (Byrne et al., 2003; Smith and Hake,\n2003). To test if BLH12 and BLH14 have the potential to interact\nwith KN1, a bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC)\nassay was performed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The\nC-terminal half of YFP was fused to the N terminus of BLH12 and\nBLH14. When these proteins were transiently expressed with KN1\nfusedtotheN-terminalhalfofYFP,theﬂuorescencewasrecovered\nin nuclei, indicating both BLH12 and BLH14 interact with KN1\n(Figure1D).WefurthertestediftheseBLHsinteractwithKN1invivo\nby coimmunoprecipitation using shoot apices. After immunopre-\ncipitation by anti-BLH12 antibody, KN1 protein was detected in\nthe wild type, but not in the blh12-3 single mutant (Figure 1E).\nSimilarly, KN1 was also detected in the anti-BLH14 immunopre-\ncipitate of the wild type, but not the blh14-1 mutant (Figure 1F).\nThese results demonstrate that BLH12 and BLH14 are bona ﬁde\ncofactors of KN1.\nBLH12 and BLH14 Localization Overlaps with That of KN1\nBLH12 and BLH14 accumulation patterns were observed in de-\nveloping tissues by immunostaining. As negative controls, anti-\nBLH12 and anti-BLH14 antibodies were reacted with blh12-3 and\nblh14-1 mutants, respectively (Figures 2B and 2E). No staining\nwas detected, conﬁrming that these antibodies are speciﬁc.\nIn vegetative shoot apices, BLH12 was detected in axillary\nmeristems and provascular bundles in the unexpanded stem.\nAccumulation was weak in the plastochron 0 (P0) leaf primordium\nbut stronger just above it (Figure 2A). BLH12 was not detected in\nolder leaf primordia. BLH12 expression in the apical part of the\nSAM was usually absent, although it was occasionally detected\n(4 out of 15 observations; Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B).\nBLH14 accumulated to high levels in axillary meristems, pro-\nvascular bundles, and the SAM. In contrast to BLH12, BLH14 was\nconsistently expressed in the SAM and was downregulated in the\nP0 (Figure 2D). Low accumulation was occasionally detected in\nthe abaxial epidermis in young leaf primordia. As previously re-\nported(Johnstonetal.,2014),BLH14wasdetectedinthepreligule\n(Supplemental Figures 2C and 2D). Both BLH12 and BLH14 were\nfound in cells destined to become axillary meristems (Figures 2C\nand 2F).\nTo conﬁrm that the BLHs are expressed in domains overlapping\nwith KN1, we performed immunostaining on serial sections of\nyoung tassels with antibodies against BLH12, KN1, and BLH14.\nAs previously reported, KN1 accumulates in provascular bundles\nand the inﬂorescence branch and spikelet meristems in tassel\nprimordia (Figures 2H and 2K) (Smith et al., 1992; Jackson et al.,\n1994). BLH12 accumulation was detected in the inﬂorescence\nmeristem, the spikelet meristem, and provascular bundles of the\nrachis (Figures 2G and 2J). Increased BLH12 expression was\ndetected at the boundary between spikelet meristems and dif-\nferentiating lateral organs, but entire spikelet meristems were also\noccasionally stained. BLH14 showed a similar accumulation\npatternasBLH12,butasinthevegetativemeristem,itsexpression\nwas stronger and more consistent in spikelet meristems (Figures\n2I and 2L). Accumulation of BLH14 and KN1 disappeared in the\nabaxial side of the spikelet meristem, where the bract-like glume\ninitiates(Figures2Kand2L).BLH12andBLH14alsoaccumulatein\nspikelet meristems of developing ears (Supplemental Figures 2E\nand 2F). Collectively, BLH12 and BLH14 accumulate in over-\nlapping domains with KN1 in both vegetative and reproductive\nshoot meristems, suggesting that these BLHs could play im-\nportant roles in meristem maintenance as KN1 cofactors.\nblh12 blh14 Double Mutants Have Short Internodes and\nLack Lateral Branches\nTo study the function ofthese BLHs in shootdevelopment,mutant\nphenotypes were analyzed after three introgressions into the\nstandard inbred B73. Because both blh12-2 and blh14-1 single\n1106\nThe Plant Cell\n\nmutants were normal except for slightly narrower leaf blades\nobserved in blh12-2 (Supplemental Figure 3A), double mutants\nwereobservedinsegregatingprogenyofself-pollinatedblh12-2/+\nblh14-1/+ double heterozygous plants. In vegetative growth,\nblh12-2 blh14-1 double mutants (referred to as blh12/14 for\nsimplicity) had narrower leaves than blh12-2 single mutants, in-\ndicating BLH14 has a functional redundancy with BLH12 in leaf\ndevelopment. At maturity, blh12/14 double mutants were clearly\nshorter than other siblings (n = 11; Figures 3A to 3C; Supplemental\nFigure 3B). Leaf number was almost the same (Supplemental\nFigure 1.

Double mutants also lacked any axillary\nbranches such as ears or tillers and had severely reduced tassels,\nleading to complete sterility. In combinations between blh12-1 or\nblh12-3 and blh14-1, the same defects were observed only in\ndouble mutants, conﬁrming that these abnormalities were caused\nby loss of both BLH12 and BLH14.\nPrecocious Elongation and Limited Growth of Internodes in\nblh12/14 Double Mutants\nDuring the vegetative stage (4 weeks old), double mutant plants\nshowed no gross abnormalities except for narrower leaves\n(Supplemental Figures 3A and 4). However, tissue sections revealed\nthat the internodes of double mutants were more elongated com-\nparedwiththewildtype(Figure4).Inwild-typesiblings,verticalﬁlesof\ncells ﬁrst become visible in internodes between P9 and P10 nodes\n(Figures 4A and 4B, bracket with three asterisks). These vertical ﬁles\nbecomeinternodeparenchymacells,whoseextensiveexpansionwill\nbetheprimarycauseofstemelongation(Sharman,1942).Incontrast,\nthese vertical cell ﬁles were detected in the internodes between P7\nand P8 nodes in the double mutants, suggesting precocious in-\nternodalcelldifferentiationduringstemdevelopment(Figures4Cand\n4D).Itisworthnotingthatradialgrowthwasalsoimpairedinblh12/14\nmutant stems (Figures 4A and 4C).\nTo examine cell differentiation states during stem develop-\nment, we analyzed KN1 accumulation. In the wild type, KN1\naccumulated in stripes in the young stem (Figure 4E). Higher\nmagniﬁcation revealed that KN1 was downregulated in the vertical\nﬁles of future internodal parenchyma, whereas its accumulation\npersisted in the nodal region above and below (Figure 4F). The KN1-\npositivecellswithactivecelldivisioninthehorizontalplane(Figure4F,\nbracket with two asterisks) are the presumed intercalary meristem.\nThese results suggest that intercalary meristems and adjacent nodal\nregions remain indeterminate at a time when the vertical ﬁles of in-\nternodal cells differentiate. In blh12/14 mutants, KN1 accumulation\nwas limited to a few nodes just below the SAM and absent in older\nnodes (Figure 4G). Importantly, the intercalary meristems normally\nfound in the wild type are lost or ambiguous in double mutants\n(Figures 4A and 4C; see Supplemental Figure 5 for higher magniﬁ-\ncations).Theseresultssuggestthattheintercalarymeristemwaslost\ndue to precocious internode cell differentiation in double mutants.\nImmunostaining of the young stem showed that BLH14 also\naccumulated in the nodal region but was absent in the internodal\nverticalcellﬁles(Figures4Hand4I).BLH12accumulationwasalso\nhigher in nodal regions compared with internodes (Supplemental\nFigure 6). The similarity of accumulation pattern with KN1 sug-\ngests that BLH12 and BLH14 maintain an indeterminate state of\nyoung nodal cells in concert with KN1.\nAt 6 weeks old or later, the premature elongation of internodes\nbecame visible. Several internodes subtending the tassel were\nmore elongated in double mutants compared with the wild type.\nHowever, their precocious elongation plateaued at around the\neleventhinternode fromthe tassel, andinthe twelfth, the wild-type\ninternode became equivalent to or longer than that of the blh12/14\nFigure 2.

Thus, the precociously differentiated\ninternodes of the double mutant lost growth activity prematurely,\nsuggesting that maintenance of the intercalary meristems by\nBLH12 and BLH14 is essential to achieve full growth potential.\nFailure of Axillary Meristem Maintenance\nThe lack of ears in blh12/14 mutants suggests a defect in axillary\nbud initiation or growth. In a family segregating all possible\ngenotypes, no blh12/14 double mutants had tillers, whereas 30 to\n60% of plants of other genotypes produced tillers (Supplemental\nTable1).ThisresultshowedthatBLH12andBLH14haveredundant\nfunctions essential for axillary bud development throughout veg-\netative and reproductive development.\nTo understand the basis for the axillary meristem defect, we\nobserved shoot apices at younger stages. At 6 weeks, the absence\nof an axillary bud was already clear in double mutants (Figure 5A).\nOccasionally,asingleelongatedprophyllwasobserved,butwithno\naxillary meristem. Tissue sections of 4-week-old blh12/14 plants\nrevealed that, in leaf axils, deeply stained nucleocytoplasmic cells\nwere initially formed, but were lost in P7 or older leaf axils, sug-\ngesting that axillary meristems were initiated but could not be\nmaintained (Figures 4A and 4C; Supplemental Figures 7A to 7D).\nIndeed, KN1 was detected in the axils of the youngest leaf pri-\nmordia, but its accumulation gradually weakened and was lost in\nP6 or later stages (Supplemental Figures 7E and 7F). These ob-\nservations show that BLH12 and BLH14 play essential roles in\nmaintaining axillary meristems.\nFigure 3. blh12-2 blh14-1 Double Mutants Show a Dwarf Phenotype.\n(A) Mature wild-type (left) and blh12-2 blh14-1 double mutant plants. blh12-2 blh14-1 tassel is shown in the inset.\n(B) and (C) Internodes of the wild type (B) and blh12-2 blh14-1 (C).

In the vegetative phase, the SAM in double\nmutants was mostly normal, although the height was slightly\nshorter compared with the wild type (Supplemental Figures 7G to\n7J). After the transition from vegetative to reproductive de-\nvelopment, however, the morphology of the double mutant tassel\ngreatly deviated from the wild type. At 6 weeks, wild-type tassels\nhad several long branches at the base and spikelet meristems on\nthe main axis (Figures 5B and 5D). In comparison, double mutant\ntassels were much shorter, lacked spikelet meristems, and, in-\nstead, initiated numerous branch-like meristems on the main\naxis (Figures 5C and 5E). At 7 weeks, wild-type tassels were\ninitiating ﬂoral organs, whereas blh12/14 mutant tassels were still\nbranching (Figures 5F and 5G). Although these branch-like mer-\nistems expressed KN1, strong accumulation was limited to the\ntip region (Figure 5H). At 8 weeks, the double mutant had an\nextremely branched tassel (Figure 5I). Some bract-like bulges\ninitiated on these meristems, indicating initiation of determinate\norgans (Figure 5I, arrowheads in inset). These results suggest\nthat an indeterminate branching pattern delays normal ﬂoral\ndevelopment.\nIntriguingly, a week later (9 weeks old), these branch-like mer-\nistemsshriveledandcollapsed.Tasselbranchesandtherachiskept\ngrowing,althoughtheirelongationwasseverelyreducedcompared\nwith wild-type plants (Figures 3A to 3C, 5J, and 5K).\nBLH12 and BLH14 Are Required for Intermediate Vein\nFormation in Leaves and to Prevent Precocious\nAnastomosis in the Stem\nIn the summer ﬁeld condition, 10 out of 15 blh12/14 double\nmutants showed a withered leaf phenotype at 7 weeks old. In\nthese individuals, several upper leaves eventually died (Sup-\nplemental Figures 8A and 8B). This phenotype was not observed\nwhen double mutants were grown in well-watered condition in the\ngreenhouse (Supplemental Figure 8C), suggesting that it was\ncaused by water deﬁcit. Since water is conducted by veins and\nBLH12 and BLH14 are strongly expressed in provascular bundles\nin the young stem, we observed hand sections of mature tassel\nrachises. We found that the number of veins was severely reduced\nin the blh12/14 double mutants, whereas each single mutant had\ncomparable numbers of veins to the wild type (Figures 6A to 6C;\nSupplemental Figure 8D). Strikingly, most of the reduction in vein\nnumber was due to loss of vascular bundles adjacent to the\nepidermis (deﬁned as outer veins), which decreased to <10% of\nwild-type numbers (Figure 6D). Vascular bundle number was also\nsigniﬁcantly lower in the inner stem, by approximately half (Figure\n6D). Because blh12/14 tassel primordia showed an abrupt\nshriveling during development, we also observed vascular bun-\ndles in tassel branches. As in the rachis, blh12/14 tassel branches\nhad many fewer vascular bundles, especially near the epidermis\n(Supplemental Figure 9).\nTo obtain a comprehensive view of vascular bundle defects, we\nobserved stem samples at 6 weeks by micro-CT (computed to-\nmography) scanning. The number of vascular bundles in the\nblh12/14 stem was greatly reduced in both the outer and inner\nregions (Figures 6E and 6F; Supplemental Movie 1). In immature\nleaves, the number of intermediate veins, but not lateral veins, was\nseverely reduced (Figures 6G to 6J). Reduction of intermediate\nvein number was also observed in mature leaf blades of double\nmutants (Supplemental Figure 10).\nDuring leaf development, midveins initiate at P0 to P1, then\nlateral veins are added as leaf margins grow (P1 or later), and\nintermediate veins appear between lateral veins at P5 or later\n(Sharman, 1942). Therefore, BLH12 and BLH14 are important for\nintermediate vein formation at relatively late stages during leaf\ndevelopment. Consistent with this interpretation, BLH12 and\nBLH14 accumulate in the abaxial epidermis of P2 to P5 leaves\n(Figures 6K to 6P), but this expression is transient since it\nwas barely detectable at later stages (Figures 2G and 2I). At leaf\ninsertion points, lateral veins bend inward to the stem center,\nwhereas intermediate veins remain near the epidermis (Sup-\nplemental Movie 1) (Esau, 1943). Thus, reduction of intermediate\nvein formation is likely to be the major cause of the severe vein\nreduction at the stem periphery.\nIntriguingly, we found that lateral veins often anastomosed a few\nnodes below their leaf insertion pointsin double mutants. In contrast,\nlateral veins of the wild type rarely anastomosed with each other and\nremainedindependentthroughseveralnodesbelowtheleafinsertion\npoint(Figures7Aand7B;SupplementalMovies2and3).Wecounted\nthenumberofanastomosiseventsandfoundthat54to78%ofveins\narriving from leaf laterals precociously fused in the double mutants,\nwhereasonly2to9%anastomosedinthewildtype(n=3;Figures7C\nto 7E; Supplemental Movie 1). Higher order vein fusions were also\nfound in the double mutants (Figure 7E). Serial sections conﬁrmed\nthat provascular bundles anastomosed in the very young stems just\nbeneaththeSAM(SupplementalFigure11andSupplementalMovies\n4 and 5). Collectively, precocious and higher order anastomosis\nfurther reduced the number of veins in the double mutants.\nHigher magniﬁcation of the tassel rachis sections revealed that\nthe double mutant vascular bundles are thicker and have more\nxylem vessels (Figures 7F and 7G). In the double mutants, 39 to\n67%ofvascularbundleshadthreeormorexylemvessels(Figure7H).\nFigure 4. (continued).\n(H) and (I) BLH14 immunostaining in the wild type at 4 weeks old.

In contrast, most wild-type vascular bundles pos-\nsessed two xylem vessels, or three at a maximum. Thus, the excess\nanastomosis is likely to result in thicker veins with increased vessels.\nPolar transport of the phytohormone auxin from leaf primordia\ninto the stem guides the position of vascular traces (Bayer et al.,\n2009).Thetransport ofauxinisperformed byauxinexportproteins\ncalled PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) (Gälweiler et al., 1998). Classic ex-\nperiments performed by Sachs showed that a local application of\nauxin on the cut surface of a stem induces the formation of new\nveins and that existing veins attract such new vascular strands\nunless the existing vein is also given an auxin application (Sachs,\n1968). Given these experiments, we tested whether expression of\nmaize PIN1a was maintained in blh12/14 veins undergoing fusion.\nFigure 5. blh12-3 blh14-1 Phenotypes during Tassel Development.\n(A) Wild-type (left) and blh12-3 blh14-1 (right) shoot apices at 6 weeks old.

From the SAM to P4 leaf insertion, BLH14\nwas expressed in the entire stem (Figures 7I and 7J). At the P5 leaf\ninsertion, BLH14 accumulation decreased in the central paren-\nchyma and in the lateral veins arriving from the P5 leaf primordium\n(Figure 7K). At the same time, strong BLH14 expression was de-\ntected in young provascular bundles. Interestingly, BLH14 was\ninitially expressed throughout provascular bundles, but adopted\na ring-shaped expression pattern in older provascular strands\n(Figure 7L). Thus, the BLH14 expression domain coincided not only\nwith the young stem region where vascular bundles differentiate,\nbut also with the developing provascular bundle itself. Given the\nveinfusionsinblh12/14mutants,thisdynamicexpressionpatternis\nlikely required for preventing vein fusions.\nDISCUSSION\nBLH12 and BLH14 are KN1 cofactors that have overlapping\nprotein accumulation domains. To investigate possible redun-\ndancy with KN1 function, we obtained loss-of-function mutants\nandanalyzedthedoublemutantphenotype.Somephenotypesare\nreminiscent of KNOX loss of function, but others are unique, re-\nvealing novel roles for these TALE TFs.

During vegetative\ngrowth, the SAM was properly maintained and produced a normal\nnumber of leaves, although SAM height was slightly shorter than\nthe wild type. Axillary meristems, in contrast, were not maintained,\nresulting in a lack of tillers and ears. These meristem defects are\nreminiscent of kn1 loss-of-function alleles (Kerstetter et al., 1997;\nVollbrecht et al., 2000). In Arabidopsis, the SAM of pny pnf double\nmutants frequently terminates but organogenesis continues from\nleaf axils (Rutjens et al., 2009; Ung et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2015).\nFigure 7.

The failure of axillary\nmeristem maintenance in blh12/14 and high level of accumulation\nofBLH12andBLH14inthesetissuessuggestthatthesetwoBLHs\nin the PNY clade have essential functions in axillary meristem\nmaintenance as KNOX cofactors.\nThe blh12/14 terminal inﬂorescence (tassel) showed an un-\nexpected phenotype. In wild-type tassels, axillary meristems\nalong the tassel branches and main rachis progress to become\ndeterminate spikelet meristems. kn1 loss-of-function mutants\nmake fewer branches and fewer spikelets (Kerstetter et al., 1997).\nBy contrast, blh12/14 inﬂorescences continue to make in-\ndeterminate branches, delaying spikelet meristem initiation. This\nindeterminate phenotype is reminiscent of ramosa1 (ra1) mutants,\nexcept ra1 tassels are fertile. RA1 is known to impose de-\nterminacy, and heterochrony of ra1 expression was implicated in\nthe diverse inﬂorescence architecture of grasses (Vollbrecht et al.,\n2005). Interestingly, the highly branched tassels in blh12/14 re-\nsembled those of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), in which in-\nﬂorescence meristems produce indeterminate branches initially\nand delay acquisition of determinate spikelet pair fate. Genome-\nwide studies show that RA1 and KN1 share many direct targets\n(Bolduc et al., 2012; Eveland et al., 2014). It is possible that BLHs\nalso share downstream targets with RA1 to promote determinacy,\nantagonistic to KN1, which promotes meristem fate.\nAn alternative explanation is that blh12/14 fail to progress to\nﬂowering, similar to the double mutant of Arabidopsis homologs,\npny pnf, which never produce ﬂowers and do not express ﬂoral\nmeristem identity genes (Smith et al., 2004). Indeed, induction of\nﬂowering by overexpression of FLOWERING LOCUS T is sup-\npressed inpnypnf(Kanrar et al.,2008). Onedifferencebetween pny\npnf and blh12/14 double mutantsisthat the formerfailstotransition\ntoﬂowering,whereasblh12/14mutantshavebecomereproductive,\nthey just fail to make ﬂowers, possibly due to the vascular defect.\nFunction of BLH12 and BLH14 in Node and\nInternode Development\nPhytomers are the repeating unit of plant development, consisting\nof a node to which a leaf is attached, a subtending internode, and\nan axillary bud at the base of the leaf. Together, the internodes and\nnodes comprise the stem, important for moving solutes through\nthe plant and providing mechanical support. blh12/14 mutants\nhave a unique internode phenotype. Internodes elongate pre-\ncociously, but then fail to maintain their ability to elongate. An\ninternode phenotype was also noted in the loss-of-function\nmutants of a rice KNOX gene, Oryza sativa homeobox 15 (OSH15),\nwhich shows a dwarf phenotype due to failure of internode\nelongation (Sato et al., 1999). Consistent with this ﬁnding, double\nmutants of kn1 and another maize KNOX gene, rough sheath1, are\nshorter if they are not well introgressed into B73 (Bolduc et al.,\n2014).Thus,thesereports suggestthatKNOXproteins arelikelyto\nhave similar functions with BLH12/14 in stem development as\ncofactors. In Arabidopsis, mutations in PNY also cause severely\nshortened internodes, resulting in clustered siliques (Smith and\nHake, 2003). Detailed analysis suggests the defect in pny is due to\ncell division orientation rather than cell proliferation (Bencivenga\net al., 2016). Mutations in organ boundary genes restore the pny\ninternode defect (Khan et al., 2015; Bencivenga et al., 2016). Thus,\nboth maize and Arabidopsis putative orthologs play a role in in-\nternode elongation, but possibly through different mechanisms\ndue to the differences in growth habit.\nWe found that KNOX and BLH proteins accumulate in a hori-\nzontal zone of mitotically active cells, the presumed intercalary\nmeristem, prior to differentiation and elongation of the internode.\nAbove this zone are vertical cell ﬁles of internodal parenchyma, in\nwhich both KNOX and BLH are downregulated. In blh12/14\nmutants, these internodal cell ﬁles precociously differentiate and\nthe intercalary meristem is lost. These results suggest that the\nintercalary meristem, which produces the internode parenchyma\ncells, is maintained by BLH proteins.\nThe reticulated network of horizontal veins is reduced in blh12/14\nmutant nodes (Supplemental Movies 1 to 3). This reduction likely\nresultsfromthelackofaxillarymeristemsthatwouldnormallyproduce\nnumerousveinsfromthehuskleaves.ItisalsopossiblethatBLHsand\nKN1expressedinnodeshaveadirectroleinformingfurtherreticulated\nnetworks. Mineral transporters are expressed in nodes of grass\nspecies; therefore, nodal veins have important functions for the dis-\ntribution of mineral elements (Yamaji and Ma, 2014). Because de-\nveloping tissuessuch asshootapicesare lowin transpiration buthigh\nin nutrient requirements, the intervascular exchange of mineral ele-\nments through the nodal vein network is particularly important.\nRegulation of Vein Formation and Anastomosis\nA deﬁning monocot feature is parallel venation in leaves and\nscattered veins in stems. As lateral veins enter the stem, they bend\ntoward the center, whereas intermediate veins run downwards at\nthe stem periphery (Supplemental Movie 1). In maize, lateral veins\nremain independent through several nodes below their leaf in-\nsertion point with a gradual shift toward the stem periphery.\nTherefore, the small veins at the periphery are a mixture of lateral\nand intermediate veins, whereas large veins at the center of the\nstem are only laterals. In nodes, the small veins at the periphery\noften branch to form a reticulate network or anastomose to each\nother. Thus, in monocots that lack a vascular cambium, the\nnumber of veinsinitiated in leavesdirectly contributesto that inthe\nmature stem. Given the water deﬁcit phenotype of blh12/14,\ninitiation of many independent veins must be crucial for maize to\nmeet water demand as plants mature.\nblh12/14 mutants initiate fewer intermediate veins in the leaf and\nthus have a drastic reduction in veins at the periphery of the stem.\nBLH12 and BLH14 accumulate on the abaxial side of a developing\nleaf in a transient fashion, consistent with the timing of intermediate\nvein initiation. Given that KN1 is not expressed in leaves, other\nKNOXcofactorsmayregulateintermediateveinformationinleaves.\nliguleless3, which is expressed in developing leaves (Johnston et al.,\n2014), is a reasonable candidate to interact with BLH12 and BLH14.\nGiven the reticulate venation found in most vascular plants, and\nindeed in certain regions of the maize plant, it is impressive that\nlateralveinsdifferentiate neareachotherinthemaizestemwithout\nfusion. Our data show that anastomosis is prevented by BLH12\nand BLH14. Just below the SAM, BLHs are expressed throughout\nthe stem but are restricted to outer regions at lower and more\nFunction of BLH TFs in Maize\n1115\n\ndifferentiated regions of the stem. This BLH expression domain\ncorresponds with the area in which lateral veins remain inde-\npendent. Once veins mature and BLH12/14 are downregulated,\nanastomosis may occur between the other veins.\nClassicalexperimentsperformedbySachs,aswellasalargebody\nof recent studies, have shown that auxin ﬂow determines vascular\ntraces(Sachs,1981;Bennettetal.,2014).Althoughtheaccumulation\nof PIN1a was not altered, PIN1b, another PIN1 protein broadly ex-\npressed in the stem, is thought to have a role in determining future\nvein traces (O’Connor et al., 2014). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-\nsequencing studies showed that KNOX proteins directly bind loci\ninvolved in multiple levels of auxin regulation (Bolduc et al., 2012;\nTsuda et al., 2014). Further studies should determine the relationship\nbetween auxin, BLHs, and anastomosis.\nMETHODS\nPlant Materials\nAll mutant alleles were isolated from Mu transposon-mutagenized pop-\nulations and identiﬁed using Mu-end primers and either blh12 or blh14\nprimers. Primers used for genotyping are listed in Supplemental Table 2.\nMutant alleles were introgressed into B73 by backcrossing at least three\ntimes. Plants were grown in the ﬁeld at Albany, CA.\nPhylogenic Analysis\nAmino acid sequences for maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis thaliana BLH\nproteins were obtained by BLAST searching in MaizeGDB and TAIR, re-\nspectively. Gene IDs are listed in Supplemental Table 3. Full-length amino\nacid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (www.genome.jp/tools/\nclustalw/). The phylogenic relationship was inferred using the maximum\nlikelihood method implemented in RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) with the JTT\nsubstitution model, and the maximum likelihood tree was evaluated with\n1000 bootstrap replicates.\nBiFC Assay\nCoding regions of blh12 and blh14 were ampliﬁed using primers listed in\nSupplemental Table 2, cloned into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen), and\ntransferred to BiFC vectors pB7WGYN2 or pB7WGYC2. These BiFC con-\nstructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101.\nAgroinﬁltration into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was performed as\ndescribed previously (Bolduc and Hake, 2009). Two to three days later,\ninﬁltrated leaves were observed under LSM710 confocal microscopy\n(Zeiss) with 470-nm excitation and 535-nm emission ﬁlters. Nuclei were\nstained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.\nAntibody Production\nFull-lengthBLH12andBLH14codingregionswereclonedintopDEST17and\npDEST15 expression vectors (Invitrogen) for antigen production and afﬁnity\npuriﬁcation, respectively. Antibody production in guinea pigs and afﬁnity\npuriﬁcation were performed as previously described (Chuck et al., 2014).\nCoimmunoprecipitation\nTotal protein was extracted by grinding 4 g of pooled maize shoot apices\n(1 cm in length) in liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was resuspended in\ntwice thevolumeofextractionbuffercontaining50mMTris(pH 7.5), 150 mM\nNaCl, 1.5% IGEPAL-CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 13 protease inhibitor mix\n(Roche),ﬁlteredthroughfourlayersofMiracloth,andcentrifugedat4000gfor\n10 min at 4°C. Protein extract was incubated with 25 mL Protein A magnetic\nbeads coupled to polyclonal anti-BLH12 or BLH14 antibody for 45 min at\n4°C. Magnetic bead-bound target protein was magnetically separated and\nwashed four times with 200 mL ice-cold wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris\n(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL-CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 13\nprotease inhibitor mix (Roche). Bound target proteins were eluted twice with\n100mLofelutionbuffer(0.2%SDS,0.1%Tween20,and50mMTris-HCl,pH\n7.5). Eluted proteins were precipitated with acetone and pellets were re-\nsuspended in13SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Following standard SDS-PAGE\nelectrophoresis and immunoblotting, coimmunoprecipitated BLH proteins\nwere detected using chemiluminescence with anti-BLH12 or anti-BLH14\nantibody and a secondary HRP-coupled anti-guinea pig IgG antibody\n(sc-2438; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). KN1 protein was detected in BLH\ncoimmunoprecipitation using anti-KN1 antibody and secondary HRP-\ncoupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were\nperformed with three biological replicates.\nHistological Analyses and Immunohistochemistry\nStandard parafﬁn sections were prepared as previously described (Tsuda\net al., 2011). For histological observations, tissue sections were stained with\ntoluidine blue. Handsections of tassel rachis werestained withtoluidine blue\nand washed in 20% acetic acid. Immunostaining was performed as pre-\nviously described (Chuck et al., 2010) except for the epitope retrieval by\nheating 10-mm parafﬁn sections in a microwave in a sodium citrate buffer\n(10 mM sodium citrate and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for 10 min.\nScanning Electron Microscopy\nMaize young tassels were ﬁxed, sputter-coated, and observed on a Hitachi\nS-4700 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV as\npreviously described (Tsuda et al., 2014).\nMicro-CT Scanning\nStem samples were harvested from 6-week-old plants and ﬁxed in FAA\nﬁxative solution (formalin:acetic acid:50% ethanol = 5:5:90) for a week.\nFixative was replaced with 70% ethanol and stored at 4°C until observation.\nBefore scanning, maize tissues were soaked in contrast agent, a 0.3%\nphosphotungstic acid in 70% ethanol solution, or a 1:3 mixture of Lugol’s\nsolution and deionized distilled water, as previously described (Metscher,\n2009; Staedler et al., 2013; Degenhardt et al., 2010). Maize tissues were\nscanned using x-ray micro-CT at a tube voltage peak of 80 kVp and a tube\ncurrent of 90 mA. Samples were rotated 360° in steps of 0.18°, generating\n2000 projection images of 992 3 992 pixels. The micro-CT data were re-\nconstructed at an isotropic resolution of 9.4 3 9.4 3 9.4 mm3. Three-\ndimensional, tomographic images were obtained using the OsiriX software\nprogram.Veintraces wereextracted from themicro-CT data using Imaris 8.2\nand FilamentTracer (http://www.bitplane.com/imaris-for-neuroscientists).\nAccession Numbers\nAccession numbers of ZmBLH12, ZmBLH13, and ZmBLH14 amino acid\nsequences are DAA56836.1, AFW81703.1, and AFW78222.1, respec-\ntively.

We show that half-\nlife of lrtA transcript from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is higher in dark-treated cells as\ncompared to light-grown cells, suggesting post-transcriptional control of lrtA expression.\nThe lrtA 5´ untranslated leader region is involved in that darkness-dependent regulation.\nWe also found that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 LrtA is a ribosome-associated protein\npresent in both 30S and 70S ribosomal particles. In order to investigate the function of this\nprotein we have constructed a deletion mutant of the lrtA gene. Cells lacking LrtA (ΔlrtA) had\nsignificantly lower amount of 70S particles and a greater amount of 30S and 50S particles,\nsuggesting a role of LrtA in stabilizing 70S particles. Synechocystis strains with different\namounts of LrtA protein: wild-type, ΔlrtA, and LrtAS (overexpressing lrtA) showed no differ-\nences in their growth rate under standard laboratory conditions. However, a clear LrtA\ndose-dependent effect was observed in the presence of the antibiotic tylosin, being the\nLrtAS strains the most sensitive. Similar results were obtained under hyperosmotic stress\ncaused by sorbitol. Conversely, after prolonged periods of starvation, ΔlrtA strains were\ndelayed in their growth with respect to the wild-type and the LrtAS strains. A positive role of\nLrtA protein in post-stress survival is proposed.\nIntroduction\nPhotosynthetic organisms need to harmonize various processes to diurnal changes in light inten-\nsity and nutrient availability. Cyanobacteria exhibit a great adaptability to changing environmen-\ntal conditions through changes in gene expression. Numerous genome expression analyses have\nbeen carried out in these organisms, especially in the model Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereaf-\nter Synechocystis). Most of these studies are related to the transcriptional response to different\nenvironmental changes [1]. However, far fewer studies address the translational regulation in\ncyanobacteria. There is ever-increasing evidence that numerous protein factors interact with the\nribosome to regulate protein synthesis and modulate the expression profile of the cell in response\nto different environmental stresses [2]. In this context, this study aims to advance in the knowl-\nedge of LrtA protein as a potential modulator of translation.\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n1 / 24\na11111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Galmozzi CV, Florencio FJ, Muro-Pastor MI\n(2016) The Cyanobacterial Ribosomal-Associated\nProtein LrtA Is Involved in Post-Stress Survival in\nSynechocystis sp.

PCC 7002 as a gene encoding a\nlight-repressed transcript [3]. A deeper study of the regulation and stability of this transcript\nrevealed that its half-life was much higher in darkness than in light [4]. The same study also\npredicted extensive secondary structure for the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of lrtA, which\nis also deduced in Synechocystis lrtA 5’ UTR. While lrtA homologous genes are present in most\nof the cyanobacterial sequenced genomes the function of LrtA remains unknown. LrtA is\nrelated to a family of proteins originally named the sigma-54 modulation proteins, based on\nthe observation that the mutation of the corresponding ORF, downstream of the Klebsiella\npneumoniae rpoN gene, causes an increase in the expression levels of sigma-54-dependent pro-\nmoters [5]. Accumulated evidences for several members of this family indicates that these pro-\nteins, widespread among bacteria, are ribosome-associated proteins whose function deals with\nmodulation of ribosome activity in order to preserve their integrity and aiding cell survival\nunder stress. Among the most studied members of this family are two Escherichia coli proteins:\nYfiA (pY, RaiA) and YhbH (HPF: hibernation promotion factor). While YfiA is involved in the\ninactivation of 70S ribosomes, HPF promotes the formation of translationally inactive 100S\nribosome particles. These particles result from 70S ribosome dimerization in stationary-phase\n[6]. Detailed information is available about how these proteins bind to the ribosome and affect\nprotein synthesis [7]. However much less is known about their role in vivo. Deletion of yfiA or\nhpf genes had no effect on cell growth or cell viability even in the context of stress situations in\nwhich these genes are putatively involved [6, 8]. For a broad view of the ribosome regulation in\nthe frame of the bacterial translation stress response, see for example [2, 9, 10].\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that most bacteria have at least one HPF homologue. These\nhomologues have been classified into three types: long HPF, short HPF and YfiA, based on the\npresence of a conserved domain and additional homologous sequences [11]. According to this\nclassification, cyanobacterial lrtA gene might encode a long HPF homologue. Formation of\n100S ribosomes is mediated by RMF (ribosome modulation factor) and short HPF in Gamma-\nproteobacteria species, similar to E. coli, whereas this process is mediated only by long HPF in\nother bacterial species. The 100S ribosome lacks translational activity, because RMF binds to\nthe 70S ribosome close to the peptidyl transferase center and peptide exit tunnel, and 100S\nribosome do not contain tRNA and mRNA [12].\nThe cyanobacterial lrtA gene product also displays sequence similarity to a spinach plastid-\nspecific ribosomal protein (PSRP-1) that is present in the chloroplast stroma either unbound\nor associated to the 30S ribosomal subunit [13–15]. This observation is consistent with the cya-\nnobacterial origin of the chloroplast [16]. More recent data suggest that PSRP-1 is a functional\nhomologue of the E. coli pY protein [17, 18]. It stabilizes the ribosome, preventing dissociation,\nand is recycled by the ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) and translation elongation factor G\n(EF-G). A sequence alignment of several members of the LrtA protein family is shown in Fig 1.\nOur current knowledge about lrtA from cyanobacteria is limited. In Synechocystis, transcrip-\ntion of lrtA is mainly dependent on the group 2 sigma factor SigB, because lrtA expression is\nsignificantly reduced in a sigB knock-out strain. SigB protein level increases 2-fold after a shift\nfrom continuous light to darkness [20–22]. In Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 lrtA expres-\nsion profiles are not dependent on the clock genes (kai) since this gene is not significantly\naltered in the kaiABC-null strains [23].\nFinally, numerous gene expression and proteomic datasets for Synechocystis, under diverse\nenvironmental and genetic conditions have been reported in the literature [24]. Although dif-\nferential accumulation of lrtA gene or LrtA protein has been described [25], the function of\nLrtA remains unknown in cyanobacteria.\nIn this study we characterize the lrtA gene from Synechocystis. We show that the cyanobac-\nterial LrtA protein is associated to the 30S ribosomal subunit and that a lrtA mutant has a\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n2 / 24\n\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n3 / 24\n\ndecreased amount of ribosomal 70S particles. A comparative analysis of lrtA-null (ΔlrtA), lrtA-\noverexpressing (LrtAS) and wild-type strains leads us to propose a positive role of LrtA in\npost-stress survival.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains, growth conditions and chlorophyll determination\nSynechocystis was grown photoautotrophically at 30°C in BG11 medium [26] supplemented\nwith 1 g l-1 of NaHCO3 (BG11C) and bubbled with a continuous stream of 1% (v/v) CO2 in air\nunder continuous illumination (50 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, white light from fluorescent\nlamps). In cultures with ammonium as nitrogen source 10 mM NH4Cl was added to BG11C\nand the medium was buffered with 20 mM TES (pH 7.5). Dark conditions were obtained by\nwrapping culture flasks with aluminium foil. For plate cultures, BG11C medium was supple-\nmented with 1% (w/v) agar. Kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, specti-\nnomycin and streptomycin were added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml when required.\nIn the case of antibiotic sensitivity assays tylosin was added in a concentration range\nbetween 200 and 300 ng/ml, erythromycin between 10 and 40 ng/ml, tetracycline at 2 and 5 μg/\nml, chloramphenicol at 0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml, lincomycin at 5 and 10 ng/ml and puromycin at 5\nand 10 μg/ml. Escherichia coli DH5α (Bethesda Research Laboratories) grown in Luria Bertani\nmedium was used for plasmid construction and replication. Cultures were supplemented with\n100 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml kanamycin when required.\nTotal chlorophyll was measured in methanolic extracts of Synechocystis cells [27].\nGeneral DNA manipulations and construction of mutant Synechocystis\nstrains\nAll recombinant DNA experiments were performed according to standard procedures [28].\nSouthern blotting was done as previously described [28]. To clone the lrtA gene, two primers\nbased on the published sequence of the Synechocystis genome [29] were synthesized: lrtA1 and\nlrtA2 (S1 Table). A 1865 bp DNA fragment covering the lrtA genomic region (sll0947) was\nobtained by PCR amplification using these oligonucleotides. This fragment was cloned into\npGEM-T to generate pGEM-lrtA.\nA Synechocystis ΔlrtA mutant strain was obtained by replacing the lrtA gene with a neomy-\ncin phosphotransferase (npt) containing cassette (C.K1) [30], which confers kanamycin resis-\ntance (Kmr). The inactivating plasmids pGEM-lrtA::C.K1(+) and pGEM-lrtA::CK1(-) were\ngenerated by replacing a 655 bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pGEM-lrtA by the 1.3 kb HincII\nC.K1 cassette, cloned in both orientations. Transformation of Synechocystis cells was carried\nout as previously described [31]. Correct integration of the C.K1 cassette and total segregation\nof the mutant chromosomes in the ΔlrtA (+) and ΔlrtA (-) mutant strains was confirmed by\nSouthern blot analysis (S1 Fig).\nFig 1.

A 1206 bp DNA fragment\nincluding lrtA promoter, 5’-UTR and ORF was amplified by PCR from Synechocystis genomic\nDNA, using the oligonucleotides lrtAKpnI and lrtASmaI (S1 Table). This fragment was cloned\nin a plasmid containing a 2 kb region of the non-essential nrsBACD operon, used as a platform\nfor integration of constructs [32]. A streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance cassette from\npHP45O [33] was placed downstream of the lrtA locus (S1 Fig). The resulting plasmid was\nused to transform ΔlrtA Synechocystis cells and the integration of lrtA gene into the nrsBACD\noperon by homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis.\nIn order to overexpress lrtA under control of the Ptrc promoter, a 591 bp DNA fragment\ncontaining lrtA ORF was amplified by PCR from Synechocystis genomic DNA, using the oligo-\nnucleotides lrtABspHI and lrtASmaI.2 (S1 Table). This fragment was cloned into pTrc99A\nNcoI-SmaI digested [34]. An EcoRV-SmaI fragment from the resulting plasmid, containing the\nPtrc promoter, a ribosome binding site from pTrc99A and the lrtA ORF, was cloned in a plas-\nmid harbouring a 2 kb region of the non-essential nrsBACD operon [32]. A streptomycin/spec-\ntinomycin resistance cassette from pHP45O [33] was placed downstream of the lrtA ORF. The\nresulting plasmid was used to transform wild-type or ΔlrtA Synechocystis cells, producing\nLrtAS_WT and LrtAS_ΔlrtA, respectively.\nPrimer extension analysis\nPrimer extension analysis was carried out using oligonucleotide lrtAR4 (S1 Table) as previously\ndescribed [35].\nRNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization\nTotal RNA was isolated from 25 ml samples of Synechocystis cultures at the early-exponential\nphase (3–4 μg chlorophyll/ml), except for experiments involving different growth phases. RNA\nextraction was performed by vortexing cells in the presence of phenol:chloroform and acid\nwashed baked glass beads (0.25–0.3 mm diameter; Braun, Melsungen, Germany) as previously\ndescribed [36]. RNA blotting to nylon membranes (Hybond N-plus; Amersham), prehybridi-\nzation, hybridization and washes were in accordance with Amersham instruction manuals. A\n655 bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pGEM-lrtA was used as lrtA probe for Northern\nblotting experiments. In order to quantify signals, in all the cases the filters were reprobed with\na HindIII-BamHI 580 bp probe from plasmid pAV1100 that contains the constitutively\nexpressed rnpB gene from Synechocystis [37]. To determine cpm of radioactive areas in North-\nern blot hybridizations either an InstantImager Electronic Autoradiography apparatus (Pack-\nard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT) or a Cyclone Phosphor System (Packard) were used.\nLrtA expression and purification\nThe pGEM-lrtA-his plasmid was created by replacing the stop codon of the lrtA gene of\npGEM-lrtA by 6 histidine codons followed by a new stop codon. An NdeI-BamHI fragment\nfrom pGEM-lrtA-his plasmid encompassing the lrtA-his gene was cloned into NdeI-BamHI\ndigested pET3a plasmid (Novagen, La Jolla, CA) to generate pET3a-lrtA-his. Exponentially\ngrowing E. coli BL21 cells transformed with pET3a-lrtA-his were treated with 0.5 mM of iso-\npropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. For purification of LrtA-His6 cells were collected,\nresuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0,5 M NaCl) with 1 mM phenyl-\nmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 x g\nfor 10 min. LrtA-His6 from the supernatant was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography using\nHis-Bind resin matrix (Novagen) and following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n5 / 24\n\nAnti-LrtA antibody production and Western Blotting\nAnti-LrtA antiserum was obtained according to standard immunization protocols by injecting\none milligram of purified LrtA-His6 protein in rabbits. Antibodies against E. coli S12 and L13\nproteins were kindly provided by Richard Brimacombe.\nFor Western blot analysis proteins were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE according to the\nmethod of Laemmli [38] and immunoblotted with anti-LrtA (1:4000), anti-S12 (1:2000) or\nanti-L13 (1:2000). The ECL Plus immunoblotting system (Amersham) was used to detect the\ndifferent antigens with anti-rabbit (1:12,000) or anti-sheep (1:5,000) secondary antibodies con-\njugated to horseradish peroxidase.\nPreparation of crude extracts from Synechocystis cells\nTo analyse the abundance of LrtA in cells of Synechocystis grown under different conditions,\ncrude extracts were prepared using glass beads as previously described [39] in 50 mM Hepes-\nNaOH buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl. Equal volumes (typically 10 μl) of the processed samples\nwere loaded on SDS-PAGE.\nIsolation of ribosomal particles\nFor ribosome isolation 3 l of Synechocystis cultures were collected by centrifugation at 10.000 x\ng. Cells were mixed in a mortar with double weight of alumina, broken by grinding and resus-\npended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM ß-mercaptoethanol) sup-\nplemented with 1 or 10 mM magnesium acetate, in order to dissociate or not the 30S and 50S\nribosomal subunits. The crude extract was centrifuged at 10.000 x g for 10 min to eliminate alu-\nmina and unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 30.000 x g for 30 min and\nthe supernatant was collected (S30 fraction). 200–300 μl of S30 fraction (approximately 1 mg\nof protein) was layered onto 10–30% continuous sucrose density gradient in buffer A with the\nappropriated magnesium acetate concentration and centrifuged at 2°C for 8 h at 25.000 rpm,\nusing a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor. Gradients were analyzed with an ISCO UA-6 detector with\ncontinuous monitoring at 254 nm. 0.5 ml fractions were collected and total protein was precip-\nitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid.\nResults\nSynechocystis lrtA transcript analysis under light-dark transitions\nThe analysis of the Synechocystis genome showed the existence of an open reading frame\n(sll0947) product that displayed strong similarity to the previously identified Synechococcus sp.\nPCC 7002 LrtA protein (Fig 1) [3]. We analyzed the transcript level of the Synechocystis lrtA\ngene under light-dark transitions and found that lrtA mRNA increased around 7 times 15 min-\nutes after transferring exponentially growing cells (2–3 μg chlorophyll/ml of culture) to the\ndark (Fig 2A). The lrtA mRNA level quickly decreased upon re-illumination of the culture.\nTranscription of many cyanobacterial genes shows an inverse behaviour upon a light-dark\nshift, reflecting a decreased metabolism of these photosynthetic organisms under darkness\n[40]. Therefore, as a control, Fig 2A also shows that under the same conditions the glnA (the\ngene encoding glutamine synthetase I) mRNA followed an inverse pattern to lrtA. The dark-\nness-dependent up-regulation of the lrtA mRNA was found to be transitory. The maximal level\nof lrtA mRNA was observed within 15 min of darkness, and thereafter transcript level\ndecreased slowly, reaching level similar to those present under continuous illumination after\n3–4 h (Fig 2A and S2 Fig). In contrast to the lrtA mRNA, the level of the LrtA protein did not\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n6 / 24\n\nchange in response to light-dark-light switches as evidenced by Western blotting experiments\nusing an anti-LrtA polyclonal serum (Fig 2B).\nThe effect of darkness on the lrtA transcript stability was further investigated. To that end,\ntranscription was blocked by addition of rifampicin to Synechocystis cells in the light or in the\ndark. Samples were taken at different times and transcript levels were determined by Northern\nblotting. In the light, the lrtA transcript level decreased with a half-life of 3.2 ± 0.1 min. How-\never, the lrtA transcript from dark-treated cells showed a longer half-life (5.3 ± 0.25 min) (Fig\n3). These data suggest that a post-transcriptional mechanism is responsible for the darkness-\ndependent regulation of the lrtA gene.\nExpression of the lrtA gene is controlled by the growth phase\nE. coli proteins related to LrtA, YfiA and YhbH, have been shown to be up-regulated during\nstationary phase [41]. In order to investigate whether Synechocystis lrtA is controlled in a simi-\nlar way, the level of lrtA transcript was determined by Northern blot at different time points\nalong the growth curve. As shown in Fig 4A, the level of the lrtA transcript was maximal in the\nearly exponential growth phase, thereafter decreasing progressively as the cell density\nFig 2.

The level of LrtA protein was also lower when cultures were reaching stationary\nphase (Fig 4B).\nStationary growth phase is reached by a deficiency in one or more macronutrients. We\ninvestigated whether nitrogen starvation also promotes a decrease in the level of lrtA mRNA.\nFor that, exponentially growing Synechocystis cells using ammonium as nitrogen source were\ntransferred to a nitrogen-free medium.

This result agrees with the previously described transcription initiation for the lrtA\ngene by both primer extension [22] and transcriptomic [42].\nTo characterize the function of the lrtA gene, a strain lacking this gene was generated by\nreplacing the complete open reading frame by a kanamycin resistance cassette (see M&M for\ndetails). Complete segregation of the mutation and absence of lrtA transcript were confirmed\nFig 3. Dark-increased stability of lrtA transcript.

The absence of the LrtA protein was\nalso confirmed by Western blotting experiments (S1 Fig). The ΔlrtA strain was viable, indicat-\ning that lrtA is a dispensable gene in Synechocystis.\nTo investigate the position of putative cis-regulatory elements responsible for the darkness-\ndependent regulation of the lrtA gene we generated a construct were the lrtA ORF (without the\nleader region) was fused to the Ptrc promoter, which was reported to act as a constitutive pro-\nmoter in Synechocystis [43]. This lrtA version was introduced in the dispensable nrsBACD\nFig 4. lrtA mRNA and protein levels as a function of cell growth. A, Aliquots of Synechocystis cells growing in BG11C medium were\ntaken at different cell densities. Chlorophyll was measured in methanolic extracts (open circles). Total RNA was isolated from each sample\n(numbers in the plot), 15 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane and levels of lrtA mRNA were determined by Northern blotting. Radiactive\nsignals were quantified, values were normalized with respect to the rnpB RNA level (mRNA relative) and plotted (closed squares). Data are\nexpressed in percentage of the maximum value obtained in the exponential growth phase. The data shown are representative of three\nindependent Northern-blot experiments showing similar results. B, LrtA level is affected by the growth phase. Total protein was isolated from\nexponential-growth-phase Synechocystis cells (2.2 μg Chl/ml of culture) or late linear-growth-phase cells (>20 μg Chl/ml of culture). 5 μg of\ntotal protein was loaded per lane. Level of LrtA protein was determined by Western blotting using anti-LrtA serum. As a control for protein\nloading, membranes were also incubated with anti-GSI. Glutamine synthetase I (GSI) is constitutively expressed, independently of the\ngrowth phase in Synechocystis cells. The data shown are representative of three independent Western-blot experiments showing similar\nresults. C, Early exponentially growing Synechocystis cells that used ammonium as nitrogen source (time 0) were centrifuged, washed and\nresuspended in BG11C medium lacking any nitrogen source (BG110C).

As a control, a wild type version of the lrtA\nlocus, including its promoter and 5’UTR region, was introduced in the same nrsBACD locus of\nthe lrtA-deleted strain, obtaining the complemented strain LrtAC (S1 Fig). lrtA transcript in\neach strain was analysed by Northern blot (Fig 5A). The results with the LrtAS_ΔlrtA strain\nshowed that accumulation of the lrtA transcript in this strain is lower compared to the wild\ntype strain. In addition, the pattern of expression is opposite to the one observed in wild type\ncells, namely, the lrtA transcript does not increase under dark conditions. On the other hand,\nthe level of lrtA transcript in the LrtAS_WT is indistinguishable from that of the wild type\nunder all conditions. Therefore our data suggest that the darkness-dependent increase in the\nabundance of the lrtA transcript depends on the leader region. Fig 5B shows the analysis by\nWestern blot of the LrtA protein in the different strains under light conditions. Surprisingly,\nboth LrtAS_WT and LrtAS_ΔlrtA strains show a higher LrtA protein abundance compared to\nthe wild type strain. This result indicates that the leader-less transcript synthesized from the\nPtrc promoter must be translated efficiently. Regarding the complemented strain (LrtAC), both\nthe level of the lrtA transcript and LrtA protein are slightly lower with respect to the wild type\nstrain but the darkness-dependent regulation of the transcript is not altered. Taken together,\nthese results suggest that the lrtA leader region stabilizes the transcript but hampers its transla-\ntion. As mentioned in the introduction, extensive secondary structure can be predicted for the\n5’UTR leader region of lrtA gene. One of these predictions is presented as supplemental mate-\nrial (S4 Fig).\nLrtA is associated to ribosomal particles\nBased on lrtA sequence homologies, we investigated whether LrtA is a ribosomal protein in\ncyanobacteria. For this purpose, extracts from Synechocystis cells were fractionated by sucrose\ngradient centrifugation using buffers with a low or a high Mg2+ concentration. Proteins from\nindividual fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and LrtA was detected by Western blotting.\nAntibodies directed against L13 and S12 were also used as markers for the 50S and 30S sub-\nunits, respectively. As shown in Fig 6, LrtA was found to be associated to both the 30S and the\n70S ribosomal particles. A significant amount of LrtA was also detected as a free form that does\nnot seem to be associated to ribosomal particles. On the other hand, negligible amount of 100S\nribosomal particles could be detected in our ribosomal profiles regardless of the growth phase\n(Figs 6 and 7).\nThe lack of LrtA affects the abundance of 70S particles\nConsidering the observed LrtA association with 30S and 70S ribosomal particles, we investi-\ngated whether the absence of LrtA may have any effect on the ribosomal profiles in Synechocys-\ntis. Extracts from Synechocystis ΔlrtA and wild type strain cells were fractionated by sucrose\ngradient centrifugation using buffers with 10 mM Mg2+ concentration. As shown in Fig 7 ΔlrtA\nstrain displayed significantly lower amount of 70S particles and a higher amount of 30S and\n50S particles could be also detected in the ribosome profiles from the mutant strain. This effect\nwas observed independently of the grow phase of the cells analyzed. These results suggest a role\nof LrtA in stabilizing 70S particles.\nThe absence of LrtA is an advantage under some stress conditions\nSome LrtA homologues have been related to bacterial stress response [2]. We therefore ana-\nlysed the phenotype of strains lacking LrtA under certain stress conditions. Since the ribosome\nis one of the major targets for antibiotics, we measured sensitivity of ΔlrtA cells to low\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n10 / 24\n\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n11 / 24\n\nconcentrations of antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. ΔlrtA showed similar sensitivity\nthan wild type cells to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and puromycin (S5B Fig).\nHowever, ΔlrtA cells were more resistant to tylosin and erythromycin (S5A Fig) than wild-type\ncells. Wild type, ΔlrtA, the complemented strain LrtAC and the overexpressing strains LrtAS\nwere tested for their sensitivity to tylosin. A clear LrtA dose-dependent effect was observed,\nbeing the LrtA-overexpressing cells the most sensitive to tylosin (Fig 8).\nIt has been described that salt stress and hyperosmotic stress have different effects on gene\nexpression and cytoplasmic volume in Synechocystis cells [44]. On the other hand, SigB protein,\ninvolved in transcribing lrtA gene, regulates salt acclimation responses in Synechocystis [45].\nWe have studied the effect of these stress conditions on the growth rate of Synechocystis cells\nwith different levels of LrtA protein. While the salt stress (0.7 M NaCl) appears to have no sig-\nnificant effect on the growth of different strains, hyperosmotic stress (0.5 M sorbitol) differen-\ntially affects wild type, LrtAS and ΔlrtA strains. Remarkably ΔlrtA cells are able to grow under\nhyperosmotic stress conditions (Fig 9). We also tested the effect of high concentration sorbitol\n(0.8 M) treatment on LrtA protein abundance in wild-type cells. As shown in Fig 9D, LrtA pro-\ntein amount decreases after sorbitol addition. This result is in agreement with the pronounced\ngrowth observed in ΔlrtA cells under osmotic stress (Fig 9C).\nLrtA affects post-stress survival of Synechocystis cells\nSynechocystis strains with different LrtA protein levels (wild-type, ΔlrtA, and LrtAS) showed\nsimilar growth rates under standard conditions (Fig 9A). To further investigate the physiologi-\ncal role of LrtA, these strains were subjected to different treatments leading to slowing or stop-\nping the growth by the lack of light or nitrogen. Following the starvation period, growth of the\ndifferent strains was evaluated under favourable conditions. In the first type of experiments,\ncells were cultured photoautotrophically (50 μmol photons m-2 s-1, 1% (v/v) CO2 in air) for\nthree weeks, reaching the late stationary phase and high cell density. Then these cells were used\nto inoculate fresh medium at low optical density (OD750 = 0.1) and evolution of the cultures\nwas monitored for five days. As shown in Fig 10A, there was a positive correlation between cell\ngrowth and the amount of LrtA protein present in each strain. LrtA lacking cell are delayed in\ntheir growth with respect to the wild-type and the overexpressing strains. The same results\nwere obtained with nitrogen starved cells used to restart cultures in nitrate-containing BG11C\nmedium (S6 Fig). In the second type of experiments, early-log phase cells of the different\nstrains growing under standard illumination (50 μmol photons m-2 s-1) were transferred to\ndarkness for four days. After this period the cultures were re-illuminated and their evolution\nwas followed visually. As shown in Fig 10B, re-illumination after the four-days darkness period,\nprovoked a drastic lost of pigmentation that was clearly appreciated two days following re-illu-\nmination. This effect was identical in all the strains. However, cells with different LrtA amount\nFig 5. lrtA mRNA and protein levels in different Synechocystis strains. In the LrtAC strain a copy of the lrtA\nlocus, including its promoter and 5’UTR region, was introduced in the dispensable nrsBACD locus of Synechocystis.\nLrtAS_WT and LrtAS_ΔlrtA strains harbour the lrtA ORF (without the leader region) fused to the Ptrc promoter in the\nnrsBACD locus, in a wild type and lrtA-deleted background, respectively.

LrtA-overexpressing cells recovered faster than wild-type cells\nwhereas LrtA-lacking cells exhibited a remarkable slow recovery.\nDiscussion\nAdaptation to changes in the environment such as cold-shock, heat-shock, nutrient depriva-\ntion, and stationary phase, is normally accompanied with an extensive reprogramming of tran-\nscription and translation. In this context, several ribosome-associated proteins are induced\nunder specific conditions in order to re-adapt the function of the ribosome to the new scenario\n[2]. Some of these proteins are coded by lrtA orthologs or paralogs genes. The results presented\nhere demonstrate that the Synechocystis LrtA protein is associated to ribosomal particles, indi-\ncating that in cyanobacteria, as in other bacterial groups, this protein family has a function in\ntranslation.\nFig 6.

PCC 7002 as a dark-transcribed\ngene whose mRNA was not detected in the light [3]. In contrast, the Synechocystis lrtA gene is\nexpressed under continuous illumination to a significant level. Similar to the Synechococcus\ngene, the level of the Synechocystis lrtA transcript is also up-regulated in the dark. As men-\ntioned in the introduction, it has been shown that transcription of lrtA in Synechocystis takes\nplace mainly by the SigB containing RNA polymerase [22]. This finding was also confirmed by\nin vitro transcription analysis [21]. In darkness, SigB increases and this contributes to the dark-\ninduced lrtA gene expression. However, in a sigB knockout strain the dark-induced pattern of\nexpression is still observed for the lrtA gene [22]. These results clearly indicate that a sigB inde-\npendent mechanism is partially responsible for the pattern of lrtA transcript accumulation. We\ndemonstrate here that lrtA transcript from Synechocystis is more stable in the dark than in the\nlight and also that the lrtA 5’UTR is responsible for this post-transcriptional mechanism. In\nagreement with our results, light-dependent differences in transcript stability were also\nreported for the Synechococcus lrtA gene [4]. However, we observe that the level of LrtA protein\nremains constant upon light-dark transitions. Cyanobacterial cells undergo a general transla-\ntional inhibition upon transfer to the dark [46]. The darkness-dependent increase in the level\nof lrtA transcript could be a mechanism to ensure that the level of LrtA protein remains con-\nstant during the dark.\nBesides the light/dark regulation of lrtA transcript accumulation, the comparative analysis\nof LrtA protein level in Synechocystis cells containing or lacking a leader-less copy of the lrtA\ngene is remarkable. The presence of the leader region has a clear negative effect on the tran-\nscript translatability. As mentioned above, extensive secondary structure can be predicted for\nthis region and could be responsible for this effect. As can be observed in the prediction shown\nFig 8. Effect of tylosin on the growth of Synechocystis strains with different LrtA amounts. Ten-fold serial dilutions of each Synechocystis\nculture were spotted on BG11C medium plates (control) or in BG11C supplemented with the indicated concentration of antibiotic and\nphotographed after 10 days of growth.

Promoters from some\nnitrogen-regulated genes belong to the same type and contain a motif for the nitrogen control\nregulator NtcA [20, 21]. We show here that lrtA expression is strongly down regulated under\nnitrogen starvation. Interestingly a putative NtcA binding site centred at position -26.5\nupstream of the lrtA TSP was found (S7 Fig). This localization of NtcA binding site is charac-\nteristic of NtcA-repressed genes [47]. According to our results, NtcA repression of the lrtA pro-\nmoter could be hypothesized. All together these results indicate that the Synechocystis lrtA\ntranscript accumulation integrates several environmental signals.\nFig 9.

In fact, the six basic amino acids involved\nin binding between the homologous protein YfiA and the ribosome [19], are conserved in LrtA\n(Fig 1). However, part of the LrtA protein could be detected in a protein fraction that is not\nassociated with ribosomes. This result indicates that, in agreement with the observations for\nother members of this protein family, LrtA is a ribosome-associated factor, not a canonical\nribosomal protein. Concerning the possible role of LrtA, the results obtained with the Synecho-\ncystis ΔlrtA strain clearly indicate that LrtA stabilizes ribosomal 70S particles under normal\ngrowth conditions at all stages of growth. The comparison of ribosomal profiles from the wild\ntype and ΔlrtA cells also suggests a drop in the number of ribosomes in the last strain. Never-\ntheless, with the available data we cannot distinguish between a possible defect in the transla-\ntion initiation or early blockage of elongation. However no differences could be observed in the\ngrowth curves of ΔlrtA and WT strains under laboratory conditions.\nDrug sensitivity assays carried out with tylosin and erythromycin showed a higher growth\nof the ΔlrtA strain versus the wild type in the presence of these antibiotics. Ribosome binding\nsites of tylosin and erythromycin have been located in approximately the same region of the\nlarge ribosomal subunit, within a hydrophobic crevice of the peptide exit tunnel. These antibi-\notics inhibit protein synthesis by blocking the egress of nascent polypeptides [48, 49]. Members\nof the LrtA protein family (YfiA, HPF) have ribosome binding sites that overlap with those of\nthe mRNA, transfer RNA and initiation factors [7]. This localization in the intersubunit\nentrance-exit channel is relatively close to the macrolides binding site, which may explain why\nthe presence or absence of LrtA modifies the effect of tylosin and erythromycin in Synechocystis\ncells.\nOne of the best-characterized proteins of the LrtA family is the E. coli YfiA [50]. In vitro\nstudies demonstrated that this protein inhibits translation and is present in ribosomes of cells\nthat reached stationary phase or are subjected to a temperature downshift [51]. Structural work\nestablished that YfiA binds to the 30S subunit and probably stabilizes a state of this subunit\nwith high affinity for the 50S subunit, thereby preventing subunit dissociation. The role attrib-\nuted to this protein was to modulate ribosome activity as a function of cell stress and tran-\nsiently repress protein synthesis, specifically during cold adaptation [19]. The other E. coli\nprotein of the family, YhbH or HPF, is also related to the down-regulation of protein synthesis,\nupon entry into stationary phase [7]. In contrast, LrtA protein from Synechocystis is present in\nribosomes isolated from exponentially growing cells and moreover it is down-regulated in sta-\ntionary phase or nitrogen-starved cells. Thus, LrtA function does not seem to be related to the\ntranslation during periods of limited growth. Rather, the results presented here indicate a role\nof LrtA in post-stress survival, specifically when growth restarts after long starvation periods.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, LrtA belongs to the long HPF type. Proteins similar in\nlength, sequence and domain structure are present in other bacterial groups [12]. Similar to the\ncase of Synechocystis, these bacterial species have no orthologues of E. coli rmf and hpf.\nAlthough in vivo studies of these proteins are limited, a detailed analysis of Lactococcus lactis\nYfiA, a long HPF type protein, has been recently published [52]. This study demonstrates that\ndeletion of the yfiA gene has no effect on the growth rate but diminishes the survival of Lacto-\ncoccus lactis under energy-starving conditions. Parallel to what we observed with LrtA in cya-\nnobacteria, the growth of Lactococcus lactis ΔyfiA was reduced compared to wild type upon\nlonger starvation and the lag times before re-growth increased more than that of wild type after\nprolonged starvation. These results suggest that the in vivo effect of lacking such proteins is\nquite similar.\nBased on our results, we cannot consider that LrtA is a stress protein; rather our working\nhypothesis is that LrtA must have a function under normal growth conditions, but may not be\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n18 / 24\n\neasily observable as a difference in the mutant growth curve under laboratory conditions. In\nfact it has been described that long type HPF proteins from other bacteria are continually\nexpressed throughout all growth phases [12]. To explain the positive effect of LrtA in restoring\ngrowth after stress, a role in re-association of ribosomal subunits can be hypothesized in view\nof our observation on the amount of 70S ribosomal particles in WT and mutant strains (Fig 7).\nLocalization of Synechocystis LrtA in the ribosome must be the same that has been described\nfor other proteins of the family (pY or PSRP-1) namely, overlapping mRNA and tRNAs posi-\ntions [18, 19]. Consistently with studies of these proteins [8, 11], LrtA could be released from\nthe 70S ribosome by translation factors such as RRF and EF-G, leading to subunit dissociation\nand translation initiation mediated by IF3 and other initiation factors. We speculate that LrtA-\nmediated stabilization of 70S ribosomes may have a function in the physiology of Synechocsytis\nand not just as a “storing” factor involved in sequestering a fraction of the ribosomes as idle\n70S monomers, when a lower number of translating ribosomes is required by the cell, as have\nbeen proposed for pY protein.\nThe results we have obtained in experiments with sorbitol are intriguing (Fig 9), since\nstrains lacking LrtA are able to grow much faster than the wild-type in the presence of 0.5 M\nsorbitol. It has been reported that incubation of Synechocystis cells in medium supplemented\nwith 0.5 M sorbitol decreases the cytoplasmic volume to 30% of the original value within 10\nmin and then remained at this level [44]. Consistent with our hypothesis about LrtA function,\nit is possible that the absence of this protein favours the normal association/dissociation cycle\nof ribosomal subunits in the translation process with the hyperosmotic pressure provoked by\nsorbitol. This would explain the growth results obtained with strains with different LrtA pro-\ntein level, as well as the down-regulation in LrtA abundance observed in wild-type cells after\nsorbitol treatment.\nIt has been described that heat shock induces ribosome subunit dissociation and translating\nribosome can dissociate erroneously [2]. It is interesting the observation that lrtA transcript\nabundance is temperature-dependent in Synechocystis (S8 Fig). The transcript is up-regulated\nat high temperature, probably because of the increase of SigB sigma factor in these conditions\n[20]. This result also supports a role of LrtA on the stabilization of the 70S particles.\nAlthough several aspects of the LrtA function are not yet known, this work is, to our knowl-\nedge, the first study that addresses the role of this family of proteins in cyanobacteria.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. Scheme of modified loci in the constructed strains. A, Schematic representation of\nthe lrtA genomic region in the WT and in the ΔlrtA mutant strains. ΔlrtA(+) and ΔlrtA(-) refer\nto the orientation of the antibiotic resistance cassette in the same or opposite direction respect\nto the lrtA gene, respectively. B, Southern blot analysis of Synechocystis WT and ΔlrtA mutant.\nGenomic DNA was digested with HincII and HaeII, and hybridized using the DNA fragment\nindicated in panel A as a probe. C, Northern blot analysis of Synechocystis WT and the ΔlrtA\nmutant. Total RNA was isolated from 15 min dark-incubated Synechocystis cells and lrtA tran-\nscript was detected by Northern blotting. Then the filter was stripped and rehybridized with a\nrnpB probe as loading control. D, Synechocystis WT and ΔlrtA mutant total extract proteins\nwere separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-LrtA antibodies. E,\nSchematic representation of the nrsBACD locus in the Synechocystis LrtAC strain. F, Schematic\nrepresentation of the nrsBACD locus in the Synechocystis LrtAS strains.\n(TIF)\nS2 Fig. Darkness-dependent regulation of lrtA mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from early-\nlog-phase Synechocystis cells growing under normal illumination conditions (Light, time 0) or\nLrtA Protein from Synechocystis\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0159346\nJuly 21, 2016\n19 / 24\n\nafter being subjected to darkness for 15, 30, 60, 240 or 480 min. 7 μg of total RNA was loaded\nper lane. Level of lrtA mRNA was determined by Northern blotting. The filter was stripped and\nre-hybridized with a rnpB gene probe as loading control. The values represented in the histo-\ngram are relative to that of cells after 15 min in darkness (100%).\n(TIF)\nS3 Fig. Primer extension analysis. Oligonucleotide used for primer extension analysis of the\nlrtA transcript was lrtAR4 (S1 Table), complementary to positions—76 to -95 relative to the\ntranslation start of lrtA. Primer extension assays were carried out with RNA isolated from cells\ngrowing under normal illumination conditions (Light) or subjected to darkness for 15 min.\nEnd-labelled 20-pb DNA ladder (Bio-Rad) was used as a marker.\n(TIF)\nS4 Fig. lrtA leader region. Predicted secondary structure o the 5' UTR of lrtA (from -312 to\n+10 with respect to translational start) according to Mfold [53]. The transcriptional start [42],\nShine-Dalgarno region (SD) and translational start (boxed) are indicated.\n(TIF)\nS5 Fig. Effect of different antibiotics on the growth of Synechocystis wild type and ΔlrtA\nmutant. Ten-fold serial dilutions of each Synechocystis culture were spotted on BG11C\nmedium plates (control) or in BG11C supplemented with the indicated concentration of anti-\nbiotic and photographed after 10 days of growth. ΔlrtA(+) refer to the orientation of the antibi-\notic resistance cassette in the same direction respect to the lrtA gene.\n(TIF)\nS6 Fig. Growth of Synechocystis strains with different amounts of LrtA, in refreshing condi-\ntions after nitrogen starvation. Early-log-phase Synechocystis cells of the wild-type and\nmutant strains growing photoautotrophically (50 μmol photons m-2 s-1, 1% (v/v) CO2 in air)\nwere centrifuged, resuspended in BG110C medium (lacking any nitrogen source) and incu-\nbated under normal illumination conditions for one week. These cells were used to inoculate\nfresh BG11C medium at 0.1 OD730 (day 1). Growth was followed for 5 days. The data represent\naverage values of three independent experiments. ΔlrtA(+) and ΔlrtA(-) refer to the orientation\nof the antibiotic resistance cassette in the same or opposite direction respect to the lrtA gene,\nrespectively.\n(TIF)\nS7 Fig. Alignment of different NtcA-repressed promoter sequences. NtcA binding sites are\nchaded in gray, -10 regions are boxed and the transcriptional start is underlined. The consensus\nsequence of the NtcA-activated promoter (centered at -41.5) is also shown. gifA 7120 (gifA\ngene from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 [54]), gifA 6803 (gifA gene from Synechocystis sp.

Recent studies demonstrate that stromal ﬁbroblast-derived molecular signatures can be used to predict\ndisease progression and drug resistance. To identify the epigenetic role of stromal noncoding RNAs in tumor–stromal interactions\nin the tumor microenvironment, we performed microRNA proﬁling of patient cancer-associated prostate stromal ﬁbroblasts isolated\nby laser capture dissection microscopy and in bone-associated stromal models. We found speciﬁc upregulation of miR-409-3p and\nmiR-409-5p located within the embryonically and developmentally regulated DLK1-DIO3 (delta-like 1 homolog-deiodinase,\niodothyronine 3) cluster on human chromosome 14. The ﬁndings in cell lines were further validated in human prostate cancer\ntissues. Strikingly, ectopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate ﬁbroblasts conferred a cancer-associated stroma-like\nphenotype and led to the release of miR-409 via extracellular vesicles to promote tumor induction and epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition in vitro and in vivo. miR-409 promoted tumorigenesis through repression of tumor suppressor genes such as Ras\nsuppressor 1 and stromal antigen 2. Thus, stromal ﬁbroblasts derived miR-409-induced tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition and stemness of the epithelial cancer cells in vivo. Therefore, miR-409 appears to be an attractive therapeutic target to\nblock the vicious cycle of tumor–stromal interactions that plagues prostate cancer patients.\nOncogene (2015) 34, 2690–2699; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.212; published online 28 July 2014\nINTRODUCTION\nImpairment of stromal cell function in the tumor microenviron-\nment is believed to be an important step in tumor progression.1,2\nWe and others have demonstrated that stromal ﬁbroblasts adja-\ncent to cancer cells in the prostate are structurally and functionally\ndifferent from normal ﬁbroblasts in the prostate.3,4 Cancer cells\nand stromal cells interact through physical contact, soluble factors,\ninsoluble\nextracellular\nmatrix\nfactors\nand\npossibly\nthrough\nsecretomes including the recently described ‘oncosomes’.5–7 Very\nlittle is known of the role of miRNAs in stromal cells and its impact\non the tumor microenvironment. miRNAs are short noncoding\nRNAs that inhibit translation of mRNA.8 A few miRNAs have been\nimplicated to have a role in cancer-associated stroma (CAS).9,10\nThe delta-like 1 homolog-deiodinase, iodothyronine 3 (DLK1-DIO3)\nimprinted region located on human chromosome 14 contains\nseveral imprinted large and small noncoding RNA genes, including\na large cluster of around 52 miRNAs expressed from the\nmaternally\ninherited\nhomolog.11\nRecently,\nthe\nDLK1-DIO3\nimprinted region was shown to be aberrantly silenced in human\nand mouse induced pluripotent stem cells but not in fully\npluripotent embryonic stem cells, indicating the importance of\nthis imprinted region in the generation of fully functional induced\npluripotent stem cell cells.12,13 This cluster has been shown to be\nessential for embryogenesis, and induced pluripotent stem cell\nformation, and possibly could be hijacked during tumorigenesis,\ntumor–stromal ﬁbroblast interaction and cancer metastasis. While\nthe function of many miRNAs within this imprinted region remains\nlargely unexplored in cancer biology, a few of the miRNAs in this\ncluster has been shown to have an important role in tumorigen-\nesis of liver and breast cancer.14–18 In a quest to understand the\nrole of miRNAs in the biology and function of CAS, we performed\nmiRNA proﬁling of stroma from prostate and bone (normal and\nCAS). Strikingly, miR-409 located within the maternally imprinted\nDLK1-DIO3 cluster was highly expressed in CAS cells compared\nwith their normal counterparts. By manipulating miR-409 expres-\nsion in prostate stromal ﬁbroblast, we observed tumor-inductive\neffects and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related\nchanges of miR-409 on cancer cells in in vitro and xenograft\nmodels of prostate cancer (PCa).\nRESULTS\nMiR-409 is highly expressed in CAS ﬁbroblasts derived from\nhuman patients\nIn a quest to identify the role of noncoding RNA expression in\nstromal ﬁbroblasts and its impact on the tumor microenviron-\nment, we performed multiplexed miRNA proﬁling by quantitative\nreal-time PCR (qRT–PCR) of normal and CAS ﬁbroblasts in prostate\nclinical samples and bone stromal cell models (Supplementary\nFigure S1).

An additional group includes MGH2O2, where\nMG-63\nosteosarcoma\ncells\nwere\nexposed\nto\nH2O2\n(which\nrepresents the role of reactive oxygen species in inducing miRNA\nexpression changes in stromal cells).\nAn unsupervised hierarchical clustering heatmap was generated\nwith the raw data (Ct values) (Figure 1a). The miRNAs were\ngrouped into different clusters depending upon their expression\npattern (up or down) in normal and CAS (Figure 1b). The relative\nfold changes are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The miRNAs\nthat were upregulated in CAS belong to a speciﬁc region in\nhuman chromosome 14, called the DLK1-DIO3 cluster. These\nmiRNAs include miR-409-3p/-5p, miR-455, miR-134, miR-127,\nmiR-410, miR-379, miR-154* and miR-487. Some of these miRNAs\nwere also upregulated in the CAS derived from the bone (MG-63)\nmodel (Figure 1b). Among the miRs, miR-409-3p had the highest\nincrease\nin\nthe\ngroups\ncomparing\nnormal\nand\nCAS\n(Supplementary Figure S2). The precursor form of miR-409\ngenerates two miRNAs in the cell: miR-409-5p and miR-409-3p.\nBoth miR-409-3p and-5p were increased in prostate CAS (SOC)\ncompared with normal ﬁbroblasts (SON) and in the bone-derived\nCAS cells (Figure 1c). These results demonstrate that stromal cells\nderived from different sites show remarkably similar pattern of\nmiR-409 expression and may be involved in tumor progression at\nthese sites.\nHuman prostatic stromal tissues with higher Gleason score\nexpress elevated levels of miR-409\nWe determined the expression levels of miR-409-5p/-3p in human\nprostate stromal tissues with various Gleason scores using in situ\nhybridization (ISH) and quantum dot (QD) labeling. The tissues\nwere separated into two groups, Gleason score o7 (Gleason 6,\nN = 25) and Gleason score ⩾7 (Gleason 7, 8, 10, N = 30). Each\npatient sample had two cores. Staining was performed by\nmultiplexed QDs as described previously.19 MiR-409-5p was\nstained initially in red and followed by miR-409-3p, which was\nstained in green. Scrambled miRNA was used as a negative\ncontrol. MiR-409-5p and -3p were detected both in the tumor and\nthe stromal components. Stromal ﬁbroblasts derived from higher\nGleason score patient tissues (⩾7) had signiﬁcantly higher/intense\nFigure 1.\nMicroRNA genomic proﬁling of CAS models from prostate and bone.

As our methodology cannot\ndistinguish normal ﬁbroblasts and CAS, we could not statistically\nconclude whether miR-409-5p is also elevated in the CAS, but\nmiR-409-3p expression was found to be statistically signiﬁcant\ndespite the technical limitations. A representative image shows\nincreased miR-409-3p and miR-409-5p staining in a Gleason score\n8 prostate stromal ﬁbroblasts (Figure 2b). These results demon-\nstrate that miR-409-3p expression in the stromal ﬁbroblast\ncorrelated with higher Gleason score in prostatic tissues, possibly\nestablishing a relationship between stromal miR-409-3p expres-\nsion and tumor progression.\nEctopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate stromal\nﬁbroblasts confers cancer CAS ﬁbroblast phenotype in vitro\nTo determine if elevated expression of miR-409 expression in the\ncancer-associated prostate stromal ﬁbroblasts has an inductive\nrole in PCa progression, we ectopically introduced miR-409 using\nlentiviral\ntransduction\nparticles\nin\nseveral\nnormal\nprostate\nﬁbroblasts (which lack endogenous miR-409 expression) derived\nfrom patients (SON and WHN: normal prostate ﬁbroblasts).\nOverexpression of miR-409-5p/-3p was veriﬁed by qRT–PCR\n(Figure 3a), and were signiﬁcantly increased in SON-409 and\nWHN-409 compared with SON-C or WHN-C. Interestingly, miR-409\noverexpression resulted in increased expression of vimentin and\nβ2-microglobulin (β2-M) protein levels (Figure 3b). While vimentin\nis a marker for myoﬁbroblasts,20,21 β2-M is a growth factor, and\nEMT) and metastasis inducer.22 We also determined the mRNA\nlevels of smooth muscle α-actin, which is a marker of myoﬁbro-\nblast and it was increased in the stromal cells expressing miR-409\n(Figure 3c). The target genes of miR-409-3p/-5p were determined\nusing qRT–PCR. These targets were identiﬁed from TargetScan and\nmicroRNA.org. MiR-409-3p target genes include polyhomeotic\nhomolog 3 (PHC3), Ras suppressor protein 1 (RSU1) and tumor\nsuppressor candidate 1 (TUSC1). and miR-409-5p target genes\nincluding stromal antigen 2 (STAG2), RSU1, retinoblastoma-like 2\n(RBL2) and nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2). These\nmRNAs were decreased in miR-409-expressing stromal cells\ncompared\nwith\nthe\nnormal\nstromal\ncells\n(Figure\n3d).\nWe\ndetermined if miR-409-5p/-3p directly binds to the 3′-untranslated\nregion (UTR) of RSU1 and STAG2 using a luciferase reporter assay\nFigure 2.\nMiR-409 detection in Gleason score tissue array using ISH and QD analysis.

Additionally, we\nmutated two sites in the 3′-UTR of RSU1 and STAG2 and were able\nto reverse the miR-409-5p inhibitory effect as evident by\nrestoration of luciferase activity (Figure 3e, bottom panels). Thus,\nmiR-409-3p/-5p targets are suppressors of oncogenes and forced\nexpression of miR-409 in normal stromal ﬁbroblasts induces a\ncancer-associated ﬁbroblast-like phenotype.\nExpression of miR-409 in normal prostate stromal cells induces cell\ngrowth and EMT in PCa cells via extracellular vesicle-mediated\ntransfer\nTo determine if miR-409 is released by stromal cells, we extracted\nthe extracellular vesicles (EVs) using Exo-Quick-TC solution from\nconditioned media (CM) of SON-C and SON-409 stromal cells and\ndetermined the levels of miR-409-3p and -5p (Figure 4a). Both\nmiR-409-3p and -5p were signiﬁcantly elevated in EVs derived\nfrom SON-409 cells compared with SON-C cells. Additionally,\nmiR-409-3p levels were 100-fold higher than miR-409-5p in the\nEVs derived from SON-409 cells. We conﬁrmed the presence of EVs\nby performing membrane staining using a cholera toxin B (Sigma-\nAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and found that miR-409 expressing\nstromal ﬁbroblasts\nhad extensive membrane blebbing and\nreleased abundant EVs measuring 1–30 μm in size (Figure 4b).\nThe particles released by cancer cells have been described as\noncosomes and have been shown to be abundant in the serum\nand urine samples of metastatic PCa patients.6,23 We tested if the\nCM from the stromal cells express exosomal markers CD63 and\nCD9 using ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S3). Next, we\ndetermined if the stromal-derived EVs were internalized by the\nPCa cells. Using Vybrant cell labeling solutions, we stained the\nFigure 3.\nEctopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate stromal ﬁbroblasts confers CAS ﬁbroblast-like phenotype in vitro.

The EVs were allowed for inter-\nnalization into PCa cells and washed after 1 h and further PCa cell\nmembrane staining was performed with DiO dye (green) to\ndistinguish them from the internalized EVs. The nucleus was\nstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Using confocal ima-\nging, we observed an increase in red ﬂuorescence in the PCa cells\nexposed to stromal EVs, suggesting that PCa internalized EVs from\nthe stroma (Figure 4c). To study the impact of stromal-derived\nmiR-409 on cell growth and EMT of PCa cells in vitro, PCa cells\nwere grown in the presence of stromal CM for six weeks. The\ncancer cells (ARCaPE and C4-2B) were extracted at different time\npoints and miR-409 expression was examined. Strikingly, only the\ncancer cells exposed to SON-409 CM had elevated miR-409\n(Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure S4). MiR-409-3p was\nelevated in the ARCaPE cancer cells at the 2-week time point\nand remained stable at that level (Figure 4d, left panel). MiR-409-\n5p was only elevated at a later time point at 6 weeks (Figure 4d,\nright panel). Upon uptake of these miRNAs derived from the\nstroma, the cancer cells had decreased expression of target genes\nof miR-409-3p (PHC3 and RSU1) and miR-409-5p (STAG2, RSU1)\n(Figures 4e and f). Moreover, incubation of ARCaPE cells with\nSON-409 CM led to increased proliferation compared with ARCaPE\ncultured with SON-C CM at 2 weeks (Figure 4g). Interestingly,\n6 weeks after maintaining the ARCaPE PCa cells in SON-409 CM,\nthe PCa cells underwent EMT. Morphologic and biochemical EMT\nchanges were observed with decreased E-cadherin and increased\nvimentin mRNA expression (Figure 4h). Similar results were\nobserved in C4-2B PCa cells (Supplementary Figure S4).Taken\ntogether, these studies suggest that stromal cells overexpressing\nmiR-409 secrete EVs containing miR-409, which is taken up by the\ncancer cells, and induces cancer cell proliferation and EMT\nprocesses. These results are consistent with published studies in\nPCa patients where miR-409-3p levels are elevated in high-grade\ntumor tissues compared with low-grade PCa tissues.24\nEctopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate stromal\nﬁbroblasts confers inductive property of tumor epithelium in vivo\nby EV-mediated transfer of miR-409 to cancer cells\nTo determine if miR-409 overexpression in normal ﬁbroblasts\ncould induce or enhance growth of cancer cells in vivo, we\nimplanted athymic mice subcutaneously with either (1) normal\nFigure 4.\nExpression of miR-409 in normal prostate stromal cells induces cell growth and EMT in PCa cells via EV-mediated transfer.\n(a) miR-409-3p/-5p expression in EVs from SON-C and SON-409 analyzed by qRT–PCR.

Strikingly, 3–4 weeks after subcuta-\nneous implantation, we found that the only group of mice that\ndeveloped visibly big tumors was those coinjected with PCa cells\nand miR-409-overexpressing stromal ﬁbroblasts (Figure 5a). The\ntumor take rate was 75% in this group, and had signiﬁcantly\nincreased tumor volume (Figure 5a). The prostate-speciﬁc antigen\nlevels were used as a tumor growth-speciﬁc marker and were\ndetermined in these mice. Prostate-speciﬁc antigen was signiﬁ-\ncantly higher in the group coinjected with C4-2- and miR-409-\noverexpressing stromal ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Figure S5)\ncompared with low levels in C4-2 alone or C4-2/SON-C. These\nresults\nare\nconsistent\nwith\nthe\ntumor\nsize\nmeasurements\n(Figure 5b). For immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ISH staining,\nwe used small Matrigel pieces with tumor and or stromal cells\nfrom C4-2 and C4-2/SON-C groups to compare with large C4-2/\nSON-409 tumors. ISH/QD revealed miR-409-3p and -5p expression\nonly in the C4-2/SON-409 tissue sections (Figure 5c). Interestingly,\nmiR-409-3p/-5p expression was detectable not only in the stromal\nﬁbroblasts, which overexpressed miR-409, but was also found in\nthe surrounding cancer cells (Figure 5c). As C4-2 PCa cells lack\nendogenous miR-409-5p/3p expression (Figure 4c, C4-2 alone\ngroup),25 the fact that in vivo C4-2/SON-409 tumors express\nmiR-409 in both the tumor and the stromal compartment\nsuggests that miR-409 was secreted out of stromal ﬁbroblasts\nand taken up by the adjacent tumor cells leading to oncogenic\ngrowth of tumor cells. Thus, we demonstrate that stromal\nﬁbroblast-speciﬁc expression of a single microRNA promotes\naggressiveness of the surrounding tumor through EV-mediated\nrelease of miR-409 and further uptake by surrounding cancer\nepithelial cells to promote cancer progression.\nStromal ﬁbroblast-derived miR-409 induce EMT of the adjacent\nepithelia in the tumor compartment\nWe performed IHC staining of tumors derived from the in vivo\nexperiments described above.

STAG2 and RSU1\ntumor suppressor proteins, the two predicted targets of miR-409,\nwere decreased in the C4-2/SON-409 tissues compared with C4-2/\nSON-C tissues (Figure 6a). Interestingly, increased vimentin and\nβ2-M expression was observed in tumors adjacent to the stromal\nﬁbroblasts only in the C4-2/SON-409 group (Figure 6a). Increased\nvimentin and β2-M represent EMT changes, suggesting that\nmiR-409-expressing stromal ﬁbroblast induced adjacent coinocu-\nlated tumor cells to undergo EMT. Increased circulating β2-M was\nalso observed in mice bearing C4-2/SON-409 (Supplementary\nFigure S5) compared with other groups. We and others have\nshown that high serum β2-M levels correlated with higher rate of\nPCa bone metastasis in cell models and human patients.22,26 As\nmiR-409 has a crucial role in embryonic development and\ntotipotency, we assessed the mRNA levels of stem cell markers\nin normal prostate ﬁbroblasts (SON-C, WHN-C) and miR-409-\nexpressing prostate ﬁbroblasts (SON-409, WHN-409).

SOX2 was\nconsistently increased in vivo in SON-409 ﬁbroblast and in few of\nthe adjacent tumor cells (Figure 6c). These observations suggest\nthat the ectopic introduction of miR-409 in normal ﬁbroblast\npromote aggressive tumor growth through activation of onco-\ngenic, proliferative, EMT and stemness programs of adjacent\ntumor epithelia in vivo. Next, we tested the orthotopic effects of\nmiR-409-expressing\nstromal\nﬁbroblasts\non\nnormal\nprostate\nepithelia. When miR-409 expressing stromal ﬁbroblasts were\nimplanted orthotopically in the prostate, prostatic hyperplasia\nwas observed in four out of four mice at 5 months after\nimplantation (Supplementary Figure S6a). None of the control\nmice developed such lesions. Prostates that received ﬁbroblasts\nexpressing\nmiR-409\n(SON-409)\nhad\nluminal\nexpansion\nand\nepithelial atrophy, increased inﬂammation and developed both\nepithelial and stromal hyperplasia. Next, we determined the\nrelative expression of miR-409-3p and -5p by ISH/QD analysis.\nInterestingly, miR-409-3p expression was more abundant than\nmiR-409-5p expression (Supplementary Figure S6b).\nDISCUSSION\nBy\nexploiting\nthe\nopportunity\nof\ntargeting\ntumor–stromal\nﬁbroblast interactions, we may be able to improve the overall\ntherapeutic responsiveness of PCa metastases and prolong\npatients’ survival. The major reason stromal signatures elicit\ngreater predictive power in clinical settings is because they likely\ncontain a normal genotype compared with the cancer epithe-\nlium.27 These alterations in CAS are expected to affect the\nexpression of a few speciﬁc genes, unlike the marked alterations\nand disruption that occur in the entire genome as in cancer cells.27\nWe see similar increases in microRNA expression (miR-409-5p/3p)\ncomparing stromal (Figures 1 and 2) and cancer cells (data not\nshown) in PCa tissues. Our ﬁndings assume great signiﬁcance in\nthe context of the stroma-derived microRNA impacting the host\ncancer cells.\nIn this study, we discovered an unexpected role for miR-409-\n3p/-5p in mediating tumor–stromal interactions. We demon-\nstrated that miRNAs, miR-409-3p and -5p, are elevated in CAS\nﬁbroblasts of prostate and bone and in patient tissue samples with\nhigh Gleason score and that they have a crucial role in impacting\nthe adjacent epithelia in vivo. We believe that among miR-409-5p\nversus miR-409-3p, the phenotypes observed in our study could\nbe attributed predominantly owing to miR-409-3p because of its\nabundant expression in cell lines and in tissues. Thus, for the ﬁrst\ntime we demonstrate that stromal ﬁbroblast-speciﬁc expression of\na single microRNA promotes aggressiveness of the surrounding\ntumor through EV-mediated release of miR-409 and further uptake\nby\nsurrounding\nepithelial\ncancer\ncells\nto\npromote\ncancer\nprogression. Many different types of EVs have been reported\nFigure 6.\nStromal prostate ﬁbroblast expressing miR-409 induces EMT in the tumor compartment.

There has been considerable debate\nin the ﬁeld about description of EVs released by cancer cells and\nCAS cells. Exosomes originate from endosomes, and the particle\nsize of exosomes is 30–100 nm. Oncosome is the term for species\nof EVs derived from cancer cells. Regardless of the terminology\nbeing used to classify EVs, our studies demonstrate particular\nrelevance of stroma-derived EVs that contains miR-409 and is\ninductive to cancer cells. Therefore, we conclude that the EVs we\nobserved in this study could be termed ‘oncosomes’, a term used\nfor species of EVs that is secreted by tumor and tumor-associated\nstroma. Consistent with our data that CAS secretes miR-409-3p/-\n5p, a very recent study from Nyugen et al.24 demonstrated that\ncirculating miR-409-3p is signiﬁcantly upregulated in the serum of\nhigh-grade (Gleason 48) PCa patients compared to low-grade\nPCa patients (Gleason o6). We also show that miR-409-3p is\nelevated speciﬁcally in the stromal component of the tumor\ntissues with high Gleason grade.\nOur results demonstrate that miR-409 derived from the stromal\nﬁbroblasts promotes EMT and tumor growth in the cancer\ncompartment\nthrough\nseveral\ndifferent\nmechanisms.\nFirst,\nmiR-409 is secreted into the microenvironment, which is taken\nup by the adjacent cancer cells and appears to spread through the\ntumor areas (Figures 4 and 5). Second, miR-409 released through\nEVs mediates tumor growth of adjacent epithelia by inhibiting\ntumor suppressors such as RSU1 and STAG2 in vitro and in vivo.\nThird, miR-409 expression in the stromal ﬁbroblasts orchestrates\nsecretion of miR-409-3p/-5p and other soluble factor, such as β2-\nM, which induces EMT and increases metastatic ability of PCa cells.\nThe mechanism of action of miR-409 appears to be through\ntargeting of tumor suppressors. The targets of miR-409-3p include\nRSU1, PHC3 and tumor suppressor candidate 1. RSU1 protein\nblocks active signaling through oncogenic Ras pathway and\nintegrin-linked kinase pathway.28,29 The integrin-linked kinase\npathway is involved in PCa EMT and metastasis.30 miR-409-5p\ntargets include STAG2, NPRL2, RSU1 and RBL2. STAG2 is part of the\ncohesion complex, where deregulation of the members of the\ncohesion complex is thought to cause aneuploidy, cancer\ninitiation and progression.31,32 Since miR-409 is activated during\nembryonic development, we observed some of the stem cell\nmarkers (SOX2) to be upregulated in miR-409-expressing stromal\ncells. The differences in expression levels of stem cell factors\n(SOX2 and NANOG) in our model systems could be attributed to\ndifferential expression levels of miR-409 in cell lines and due to\npatient heterogeneity.\nWhen miR-409 was delivered to the prostate gland through\nstromal ﬁbroblasts, this miRNA could possibly be transferred to\nprostate epithelium via EVs, which could mediate the uptake and\npromote subsequent hyperplasia of the participating epithelial\ncells in vivo. Although adenocarcinoma was not observed in vivo at\nthe 5-month time-point postorthotopic implantation (when mice\nwere killed), it is possible to attribute this observation to the\nmigratory nature of the myoﬁbroblast-like stromal ﬁbroblasts that\noverexpress miR-40933 (Supplementary Figure S6).\nIn summary, our study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of\nstromal-derived miR-409 that is capable of promoting tumor\ngrowth and EMT of adjacent tumor epithelia in vivo. The transfer\nof miR-409 via EVs from prostate stromal ﬁbroblasts to cancer\nepithelium could result in the repression of tumor suppressors,\ninduction of EMT and the promotion of the growth and survival of\nprostate epithelium. Therefore, miR-409 may be a new therapeutic\ntarget for the treatment of both benign and malignant growth of\nthe prostate gland and to break the vicious stromal–epithelial\ninteractions that contributes to the tumor heterogeneity in the\ntumor microenvironment.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture\nHuman androgen-independent PCa ARCaPE, C4-2B and C4-2 cells,34 and\nstromal cell pairs from patients (normal/CAS-SON/SOC, WHN/WHC) were\nisolated from patients in Emory University (Atlanta, GA, USA).4 Bone\nstromal cells (HS-27a) cultured in rotary wall vessel (HS-27aRWV) and HS-27a\ncultured in rotary wall vessel with C4-2 PCa cells (HS-27aC4-2),4 and MG-63\nosteosarcoma cells cultured in rotary wall vessel (MG-63RWV) and MG-63\ncultured in rotary wall vessel with LNCaP or C4-2 PCa cells (MG-63LNCaP and\nMG-63C4-2) were also generated in the laboratory (additional information in\nthe Supplementary Methods).4 The stromal cells were isolated for further\nstudy. PCa cells, stromal cells and 293T cells were cultured in the T-medium\nas mentioned previously.4,25 All cells were tested for mycoplasma every\n6 months and were negative.\nmiRNA expression\nqRT–PCR.\nMiRNA expression analysis by real-time PCR was performed\nseparately for each miRNA using speciﬁc primer sets (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA, USA) as described previously.25 RNU6B was used for\nnormalization. MiRNA global proﬁling qRT–PCR multiplexing procedure is\ndescribed in Supplementary Information.\nmRNA analysis.\nTotal RNA was isolated from conﬂuent monolayers of cells\nusing the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was made using\nSuperscriptIII Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Camarillo, CA, USA).\nmRNA primers were designed and synthesized at Integrated DNA\nTechnologies (Coralville, IA, USA). mRNA expression levels were deter-\nmined by qRT–PCR assays and SYBR Green Dye (Applied Biosystems). Ct\nvalues were normalized to 18s RNA or β-actin and plotted as relative fold\nchange.\nmiRNA determination from EVs.\nStromal cells were maintained in the\nT-medium with exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum media supplement\n(System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) for 72 h and CM was used to\nextract EVs. Exo-Quick-TC (System Biosciences) for tissue culture media and\nSeraMir Exosome RNA Puriﬁcation Kit (System Biosciences) were used to\nextract miRNA from EVs.6,23 MiRNA was detected for miR-409-5p/-3p and\nRNU6B by qRT–PCR analysis.\nWestern analysis and IHC.\nWestern analysis and IHC staining was\nperformed as described previously.35 The following primary antibodies\nwere used: Ki-67 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), STAG2 (Cell Signaling\nTechnologies, Danvers, MA, USA), RSU1 (Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL,\nUSA), vimentin (V9), SOX-2, β2-M and vimentin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nSanta Cruz, CA, USA), PHC3 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA)\nand β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).\n3′-UTR assay\nRSU1 luciferase activity: The 293T cells were stably transduced with Lenti\nGoclone lentivirus particles containing a constitutive promoter driving a\nhybrid luciferase-3′-UTR of human RSU1 (MISSION 3′-UTR Lenti GoClone;\nSigma-Aldrich). Cells were selected using puromycin. Mimics of miR-409-\n5p, miR-409-3p and control miRNA were transiently transfected into\nthese\n293T\ncells\nand\nluciferase\nactivity\nwas\ndetermined\nusing\nLightswitch luciferase assay system 24 h later (SwitchGear Genomics,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA).\nSTAG2 or RSU1 mutant luciferase activity: 3′-UTR construct (SwitchGear\nGenomics) was used as the wild-type (WT) luciferase construct and it was\nfurther mutated as described in Supplementary Materials and methods.\nMiR-409-5p mimic and control miRNA were transiently transfected along\nwith the WT or mutant (STAG2 or RSU1) construct into these 293T cells and\nluciferase activity was determined 24 h later using LightSwitch Luciferase\nAssay System (SwitchGear Genomics).\nISH-QDs.\nMouse prostates and tumor xenografts were formalin-ﬁxed and\nparafﬁn-embedded. miRNA ISH protocol was followed as per the\nmanufacturer’s instruction (Exiqon, Woburn, MA, USA). The scramble and\nmiR-409-5p and -3p probes were 5′-biotin labeled. The probes were linked\nto streptavidin-conjugated QDs. Tissue sections were deparafﬁnized,\ntreated with proteinase-K and dehydrated. ISH was performed for 1 h at\n55 °C, followed by washes and streptavidin blocking and a reaction with\nstreptavidin-conjugated QD at a speciﬁed wavelength. QD staining\nStromal miR-409 in prostate cancer development\nS Josson et al\n2697\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited\nOncogene (2015) 2690 – 2699\n\nprocedure was followed as described previously.19 Single QD labeling was\nperformed and scramble or miR-409-5p or miR-409-3p probes labeled with\n625 nm QDs. Images were taken at × 40 magniﬁcation. Hematoxylin and\neosin staining was performed on subsequent tissue sections.\nHuman Gleason tissue array.\nA Gleason score tissue array was obtained\nfrom Vancouver Prostate Center (Vancouver, BC, Canada). The use of tissue\nspecimens was approved by the institution review board of the Cedars-\nSinai Medical Center (Los Angeles, CA, USA; IRB no. Pro21228). The tissues\nconsisted of Gleason score o7 (Gleason 6) (N = 25) and Gleason ⩾7\n(Gleason 7, 8, 10) (N = 30). Each tissue had two cores. The tissue array was\nstained for hematoxylin and eosin and graded by a pathologist to conﬁrm\nthe Gleason score. Multiplexed QD labeling was performed as mentioned\npreviously.19 MiR-409-5p was labeled with 625 nm QD (red) followed by\nmiR-409-3p (green), which was labeled with 565 nm QD. Signals were\nquantiﬁed as mentioned previously.19 The QD ﬂuorescence intensity of\neach tissue section was determined and analyzed. Statistical analysis was\nperformed on the data set using a non-parametric Wilcoxon’s rank-sum\ntest method. Data distribution was depicted as box plots.\nLentiviral transduction\nNormal prostatic stromal cell lines (SON, WHN) were transduced with\nmiR-409 lentivirus expressing GFP or control GFP lentivirus. Lentiviral\npreparation and transduction of cell lines were performed as per the\nmanufacturer’s instructions (System Biosciences).\nTumor stroma in vitro studies.\nCM from stromal cells were collected every\n3 days and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and these were added onto\nARCaPE cells and C4-2B cells in a 1:1 ratio with fresh media. Cancer cells\nwere maintained for 6 weeks in CM from stromal cells SON-C and SON-409.\nAt different time points, the cancer cells were used to look at miR-409-3p\n/-5p and their mRNA targets and EMT markers using qRT–PCR or western\nanalysis.\nEV-mediated transfer studies using Vybrant cell-labeling solution\nCM from SON-409 stromal cells was collected and EVs were extracted using\nExo-Quick-TC solution (System Biosciences). EVs were suspended in\nphosphate-buffered saline and then treated with DiL dye (red) (Vybrant\nMulti-Color Cell Labeling Kit; Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37 °C. ARCaPE\nand C4-2B PCa cells were treated with dye-labeled EVs for 1 h at 37 °C.\nCancer cells were washed three times with the T-medium and once with\nphosphate-buffered saline to remove the stain. Further cell membrane\nlabeling was carried out with DiO dye (green) to distinguish the\ninternalization of EVs. DiO was treated with cells for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells\nwere washed with PBS and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole\nand visualized using confocal microscope at × 63 magniﬁcation.\nXenograft studies.\nAll animal experiments were IACUC approved and\ncarried out in accordance with institutional guidelines. The tumor stroma\nsubcutaneous xenograft studywas follows: four-week-old male nude mice\n(NCRNU; Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) were subcutaneously injected with\ncoculture of PCa cells (1.5 × 106) and stromal cells (0.5 × 105) with Matrigel\n(1:1). The groups consisted of tumor alone (C4-2 cells, n = 8), normal stroma\n(SON-C, n = 6), normal prostate stroma expressing miR-409 (SON-409, n = 6)\nand tumor–stroma combinations (C4-2/SON-C, n = 4 and C4-2/SON-409,\nn = 4). Tumor volume was measured weekly. At 3 weeks, tumors\ndeveloped. Mice were killed in the fourth week. Hematoxylin and eosin\nand IHC analysis was performed.\nStatistical analysis\nValues were expressed as means ± standard deviation. All experiments\nwere carried out in triplicate at least two independent times. Statistical\nanalysis was performed using Student’s t-test or one-way analysis\nof variance. For tissue Gleason score array, a non-parametric Wilcoxon’s\nrank-sum test is used. Values of Po0.05 were considered to be statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was supported by a grant from P01-CA98912, DAMD-17-03-02-0033, RO1-\nCA122602 (LWKC) and TMU102-AE-B01, NSC102-2320-B-039-058, and MOHW103-TD-\nB-111-01 (S-YS).

One of the active compounds has been iso-\nlated and identified as oleanolic aldehyde coumarate (OALC), a novel bioactive compound\nthat inhibits the formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm and its maintenance as well as the\nexpression of the las and rhl QS systems. Consequently, the production of QS-controlled\nvirulence factors including, rhamnolipids, pyocyanin, elastase and extracellular polysaccha-\nrides as well as twitching and swarming motilities is reduced. Native acylhomoserine lac-\ntones (AHLs) production is inhibited by OALC but exogenous supply of AHLs does not\nrestore the production of virulence factors by OALC-treated cultures, indicating that OALC\nexerts its effect beyond AHLs synthesis in the QS pathways. Further experiments provided\na significant inhibition of the global virulence factor activator gacA by OALC. OALC disorga-\nnizes established biofilm structure and improves the bactericidal activity of tobramycin\nagainst biofilm-encapsulated PAO1 cells. Finally, a significant reduction of Caenorhabditis\nelegans paralysis was recorded when the worms were infected with OALC-pre-treated P.\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n1 / 32\na11111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Rasamiravaka T, Vandeputte OM, Pottier L,\nHuet J, Rabemanantsoa C, Kiendrebeogo M, et al.\n(2015) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation\nand Persistence, along with the Production of\nQuorum Sensing-Dependent Virulence Factors, Are\nDisrupted by a Triterpenoid Coumarate Ester Isolated\nfrom Dalbergia trichocarpa, a Tropical Legume.

Taken together, these results show that triterpenoid coumarate esters are suit-\nable chemical backbones to target P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms.\nIntroduction\nOver the last decades, pathogenic bacteria have presented an increasing multi-drug resistance\nprevalence all over the world [1, 2], a situation that has stimulated the search for new potential\nantibacterial drug targets [3, 4]. Inhibiting the bacterial virulence without killing the pathogen\nis an attractive anti-pathogenic approach that is increasingly explored [5, 6] with the putative\nadvantage to generate less selective pressure as compared to antibiotics [7]. Quorum sensing\n(QS), a bacterial cell-to-cell communication, is used by many bacteria to detect their critical\ncell density by producing and perceiving diffusible signal molecules in order to coordinate a\ncommon behavior such as the expression and regulation of virulence factors, motility and bio-\nfilm formation [8, 9]. Therefore, the inhibition of QS systems might be a more valuable\napproach than targeting a single particular virulence factor for therapeutic or prophylactic con-\ntrol of infections.\nThe opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa is known to be an important human, animal and\nplant pathogen that produces several virulence factors. Its QS systems are probably the best-\ncharacterized among Gram-negative bacteria [10]. P. aeruginosa possesses two main QS sys-\ntems (las and rhl) which drive the production (by the synthetases LasI and RhlI) and the detec-\ntion (by the transcription factors LasR and RhlR) of the acylhomoserine lactones (AHL) N-\n(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine\nlactone (C4-HSL), respectively [11]. The las system controls LasB elastase, LasA protease, Apr\nalkaline protease, and exotoxin A [12] while the rhl system enhances the production of rham-\nnolipids, pyocyanin, LasB elastase, hydrogen cyanide, and cytotoxic lectins which are all\ninvolved in cellular toxicity and acute infection [13, 14]. The las and the rhl systems are orga-\nnized in a hierarchical manner such that the las system regulates the rhl system at the transcrip-\ntional and post-transcriptional levels [15, 16]. In addition, P. aeruginosa releases a third\nintercellular signal, 2-heptyl-hydroxy-4-quinolone (designated the Pseudomonas quinolone\nsignal [PQS]), which interacts with the acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) systems in an intricate\nway [17]. The PQS system is incorporated into the QS hierarchy in times of cell stress, and acts\nas a link between the las and rhl quorum-sensing systems [18]. In this QS regulatory cascade,\nthe las and rhl systems are positively influenced by the global activator GacA and the global\nregulator Vfr at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [19, 20].\nBiofilms are surface-associated communities enclosed within an extracellular matrix [21]\nmainly composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and other macromolecules\nand chemicals [22]. Particularly, extracellular polysaccharides are a crucial component of the\nmatrix, and carry out a range of functions such as promoting attachment to surfaces and other\ncells, building and maintaining biofilm structure, as well as protecting the cells against environ-\nmental assaults and predation, including antimicrobials and host defenses [23, 24].\nQS systems and biofilm formation are crucial components in the development of acute and\nchronic infections, particularly for P. aeruginosa [25, 26], in which they play important roles in\nbacterial persistence and reduce sensitivity to antimicrobials [27]. Accordingly, molecules that\naffect the regulation of both QS mechanisms and biofilm formation could be powerful allies for\nconventional antibiotics in the struggle against bacterial infections [28, 29].\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n2 / 32\nand analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of\nthe manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n\nRecently, we demonstrated that a crude extract of Dalbergia trichocarpa bark inhibits the\nproduction of QS-dependent virulence factors in P. aeruginosa (pyocyanin, protease and elas-\ntase) as well as biofilm formation [30]. The present study describes the isolation, the identifica-\ntion and the biological characterization of the major bioactive compound in D. trichocarpa\nextract that inhibit both QS and biofilm formation without affecting bacterial growth.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant material\nStem bark samples of D. trichocarpa Baker. were collected in Madagascar from trees growing\nclose to the city of Morondava (near the Kirindy forest, with the following GPS coordinates:\n20° 04.120’ S 44° 39.250’ E, elevation 88 m). Collection authorization was delivered by MINE-\nNVEF (Ministry of Environment and Forest) authority represented by the Direction of Conser-\nvation, Biodiversity and Protected Area of Madagascar. Collection was carried out outside the\nprotected Kirindy forest (tree cutting permission number 183/13/MEF/SG/DGF/DCB/SAP/\nSCB from 09/01/2013). Voucher specimen were deposited at FOFIFA (Centre National de la\nRecherche Appliquée au Développement Rural, BP 1690 Ampandrianomby 101 Antananarivo,\nMadagascar) and PBZT herbarium (Botanic and Zoologic Park of Tsimbazaza, Rue Fernand\nKASANGA Tsimbazaza 101 Antananarivo, Madagascar). D. trichocarpa Baker. is in the\n“Lower Risk/Least Concern” category according to the IUCN Red list of threatened Species\n(http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/36223/0).\nBacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions\nPAO1 strain and its derivatives were grown (37°C, agitation 175 rpm) in LB-MOPS broth\n(50 mM, pH 7) supplemented with carbenicillin (300 μg mL-1) when appropriate. Plasmids (S1\nTable) were used and introduced in PAO1 as previously described [31].\nP. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant strains were obtained from the Transposon Mutant Collection\n(Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington; http://www.gs.washington.edu/\nlabs/manoil/libraryindex.htm) and include mutants 11174 (ΔPA1432, ΔlasI), 17281 (ΔPA1430,\nΔlasR), 32454 (ΔPA3476, ΔrhlI) and 3452 (ΔPA3477, ΔrhlR) [32]. When required, the medium\nwas supplemented with 10 μM (final) 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL as described previously [33].\nChemicals\nNaringenin, naringin and 4-nitro-pyridine-N-oxide (4-NPO) were purchased from Sigma-\nAldrich and dissolved in 100% DMSO. Antimicrobial drugs (azithromycin and tobramycin)\nwere purchased from TCI (Tokyo chemical industry Co. LTD, Japan) and dissolved in deion-\nized water. The AHLs 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and\ndissolved in 100% DMSO.\nChromatographic purification of the major bioactive compound from D.\ntrichocarpa barks\nDried powdered samples of D. trichocarpa stem barks (10 kg) were macerated overnight at\nroom temperature in 20 L n-hexane and extracted with 60 L n-hexane by percolation (1 liter\nfor 1 h). The gathered n-hexane extracts were filtered on Whatman paper, evaporated under\nvacuum and the resulting residue (40 g) was stored at -20°C. The residue was dissolved in 30\nmL of n-hexane, loaded onto a chromatography column (35 by 4 cm) filled with silica gel 60\nF254 (63–200 μm / 70–230 mesh; Merck) and eluted with n-hexane and a step gradient of ethyl\nacetate (100:10 to 10:100) to afford 6 fractions (fractions F1 to F6) and then with ethyl acetate\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n3 / 32\n\nand a step gradient of methanol (100:10 to 10:100) to afford 3 fractions (fractions F7 to F9).\nThe fractions were evaporated and stored at -20°C. The fraction most inhibitory of QS and bio-\nfilm was further fractionated by preparative HPLC using RP C18 column (Altima HP, 13 by\n250 mm; 5μm) that was eluted with a gradient of water-acetonitrile (10:90 in 3 min, 10:90 to\n0:100 in 4 min, 0:100 in 2 min, 0:100 to 10:90 in 1 min, 10:90 in 5 min). Subfractions were col-\nlected, monitoring at 300 nm, using Buchi fraction collector C-660 with SepacoreRecord soft-\nware assistance, and evaporated for anti-QS/anti-biofilm activities. The active subfraction was\nfurther purified on prepHPLC with the same conditions until positive peak purity, as assessed\nby spectroscopy (diode array detection under ChemStation 9.0 software) and TLC (Silicagel\nRF254 Merck; mobile phase, Hexane-ethyl acetate [70–30]; detection: UV illumination (254\nand 366 nm) and after developing by spraying with 10% (v/v) H2SO4 followed by heating at\n110°C for 10 min).\nElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis and NMR\nspectroscopy of purified compound\nThe purified active compound (OALC) was analyzed by LC-ESI-MS with direct infusion into a\nFinnigan LCQ DUO mass spectrometer. The ESI parameters were as follows: solvent acetoni-\ntrile; concentration loaded 10 μg mL-1; negative ionization mode; nebulizer tip set at 250°C and\n4.52 kV; cone voltage set at 5 kV; sheath gas (nitrogen) flow rate at 28 arbitrary units; collision\nenergy at 70 eV; MS data were acquired in the m/z range from 50 to 2000. 1H- and 13C-NMR,\nCOSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spec-\ntrometer. Standard pulse sequences and parameters were used for the NMR experiments and\nall chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, δ).\nGene expression and β-Galactosidase measurements\nTo monitor gene expression of QS-dependent (lasB and rhlA), QS-regulatory (lasR/I and rhlR/\nI), gacA and vfr genes, the β-galactosidase activity induced by reporter genes was measured\nusing o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside [34, 35]. After growth in liquid LB-MOPS-\nCarbenicillin at 37°C and 175 rpm for 18 hours, PAO1 reporter strains were washed twice in\nfresh LB medium and resuspended in liquid LB-MOPS-Carbenicillin. PAO1 reporter strains\ninoculums (50 μl) were incubated (37°C with 175 r.p.m. agitation) for 18 hours in 1 mL\nLB-MOPS-Carbenicillin (initial A600nm of culture comprised between 0.020 and 0.025) supple-\nmented with 10 μl of OALC dissolved in DMSO (200 μM) or 10 μl of DMSO (1%, v/v). Addi-\ntionally, the flavanone naringenin, known as QS quencher [33], and its inactive glycoside\n(naringin) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. After incubation, the bacte-\nrial density was assessed by spectrophotometry (A600nm) and the gene expression by the β-\ngalactosidase assay.\nFor global gene transcription monitoring, a QS-independent gene, i.e. the isocitrate lyase-\nencoding aceA gene expression was also evaluated [36].\nRhamnolipids extraction and quantification\nFor rhamnolipids extraction, P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown at 37°C with agitation at 175 rpm\nfor 18 h in 1 mL LB-MOPS medium supplemented with OALC (200 μM), naringin (4 mM) or\nnaringenin (4 mM) or DMSO (1%, v/v). Bacterial cultures were centrifuged (3200 × g, room\ntemperature, 5 min) and 1 mL of cell-free supernatant (Filtre Ultrafree-CL filters Millipore)\nwas mixed with 1 mL of ethyl acetate and vigorously vortexed. Phase separation was then real-\nized by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at maximum speed (1 min). The upper,\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n4 / 32\n\nrhamnolipid-containing phase was transferred to a new reaction tube. This procedure was\nrepeated three times. Finally, the organic solvent was removed by evaporation in a vacuum\ncentrifuge.\nRhamnolipids were quantified by a methylene-blue-based method as described by Pinzon\nand Ju, [37] with some modification. Briefly, the rhamnolipid extract of each sample was dis-\nsolved in 4 mL of chloroform and put in contact with a freshly prepared methylene blue solu-\ntion (200 μL of a 1 g l-1 methylene blue and 4.9 mL of distilled water). The pH of this\nmethylene blue aqueous solution is adjusted to 8.6 ± 0.2 (usually achieved by adding 15 μL of a\n50 mM borax buffer). After being vigorously mixed for 4 minutes, the samples were left to\nstand for 15 min for complexation. One mL of the chloroform phase was transferred in a new\nEppendorf tube and mixed by vortexing with 500 μl of HCl 0.2 N. Finally, 200 μl of the superior\nacid phase, containing a portion of the complexed methylene blue, was transferred in a 96-well\nmicroplate (Greiner clear) and the absorbance was measured at 638 nm with SpectraMax M2\ndevice (Molecular Devices) against an HCl 0.2 N blank. The absorbance values were converted\nto rhamnolipids concentration using a calibration curve established by applying the same pro-\ncedure to standard rhamnolipids solutions of different concentrations.\nHomoserine lactone quantification\nAHLs (C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL) were extracted from PAO1 cultures and quantified by\nLC-ESI-MS as proposed by Makemson et al. [38]. P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown at 37°C with\nagitation at 175 rpm for 18 h in 5 mL LB-MOPS medium supplemented with OALC (200μM),\nnaringenin (4 mM) or naringin (4 mM) or DMSO (1%, v/v). Bacterial cultures were centri-\nfuged (3220 × g, room temperature, 5 min) and supernatants (4 mL) were acidified with 80 μl\nglacial acetic acid prior to being extracted three times with ethyl acetate (4 mL). Ethyl acetate\nextracts were combined, evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 1 mL acidified ethyl acetate\n(0.1%, v/v, glacial acetic acid). For background measurement, supernatants (4 mL) were alka-\nlinized with 80 μl 4 M NaOH before ethyl acetate extraction, hydrolyzed lactone rings being\ntoo polar to be extracted. ESI-MS quantification was done by direct infusion into a Finnigan\nLCQ DUO mass spectrometer under soft ionization conditions (positive ionization mode; neb-\nulizer tip set at 250°C and 4.52 kV; cone voltage set at 5 kV; sheath gas (nitrogen) flow rate: 30\narbitrary units) that did not fragment the AHLs. Scans were averaged over 1 min. The peak\nintensities for C4-HSL (pseudomolecular ion, m/z = 172; ammonium adduct, m/z = 189;\nsodium adduct, m/z = 194; solvent adduct, m/z = 260) and 3-oxo-C12-HSL (pseudomolecular\nion, m/z = 298; ammonium adduct, m/z = 315; sodium adduct, m/z = 320; solvent adduct, m/\nz = 386) were combined and converted to concentrations by using a standard curve generated\nfrom the pure compounds. Background readings from hydrolyzed samples extracted with ethyl\nacetate were subtracted from those of the acid-extracted bacterial cultures before conversion.\nTo evaluate an eventual chemical-modulation activity of OALC, LB-MOPS medium supple-\nmented with OALC and/or exogenous AHLs (3-oxo-C-12HSL and C4-HSL) were incubated\nfor 18h and AHLs have been extracted following the same procedure.\nQuantitative analysis of pyocyanin and elastase production by P.\naeruginosa PAO1\nThe production of pyocyanin and elastase was assessed according to previously described pro-\ncedures [39, 40]. P. aeruginosa PAO1 or mutant strains were grown for 18 h in liquid\nLB-MOPS (supplemented with 60 μg mL-1 tetracycline for mutant strains). PAO1 cell suspen-\nsion (50 μl) was added to 1 mL of LB-MOPS (starting A600nm ranged between 0.02 and 0.025)\nsupplemented with 10 μl of OALC dissolved in DMSO (200 μM) or 10 μl of DMSO (1%, v/v)\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n5 / 32\n\nor naringenin (4 mM) or naringin (4 mM). When required, the medium was supplemented\nwith 10 μM of 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL as described previously [33]. After 18 h of growth,\nsamples were taken to assess growth (A600nm) and pyocyanin production. The LasB elastase\nproduction was assessed through the measurement of elastase activity using elastin-Congo Red\n[40].\nAssessment of bacterial growth\nRelative growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 after 18 hours in the presence of OALC was evaluated\nby measuring the cell density at A600nm with a SpectraMax M2 device (Molecular Devices). The\neffect of OALC on P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth kinetic was evaluated by evaluating PAO1 cell\ndensity (A600nm) over 22 hours culture, confirmed by cell counting (colony-forming units, C.F.\nU) at times 8 and 18 h.\nMotility assays\nThe swarming motility was examined using LB agar plate described previously [41]. Briefly, LB\nagar (0.6%) medium supplemented with glutamate (0.05%) and glucose (0.2%) was autoclaved\nfor sterilization. Sterilized medium was cooled at temperature between 45–50°C and then sup-\nplemented (DMSO 1% or OALC at 200 μM or naringenin at 4 mM or naringin at 4 mM)\nbefore being poured into compartmented Petri dishes. Gelled plates were inoculated at their\ncenter with 5 μl of a bacterial culture of PAO1 cells diluted to a turbidity of 1 at 600 nm and\nplaced at 37°C when inoculums spots are dry. Bacteria spreading from the inoculation spot\nwere measured after 24 hours. The twitching motility was assayed as previously described [42]\nwith slight modification. Briefly, plates with LB agar (1%) supplemented (DMSO 1% or OALC\nat 200 μM or naringenin at 4mM or naringin at 4mM) poured to an average depth of 3 mm\nwere prepared and dried briefly. A hole (about 1mm diameter) was dug in the center of each\ncompartment through the agar and 5 μl of P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells diluted to a turbidity of 1\nat 600 nm were spotted inside the hole, dried briefly and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. After\nthe incubation period, bacteria spreading between the agar and the bottom of the petri dish\nwere measured. For diameters measurement, the agar was discarded from petri dish and\ntwitching motility zones were easily visualized by staining for 1 minute with 0.1% (w/v) of crys-\ntal violet as proposed by Darzins [43].\nBiofilm quantification and synergistic activity with tobramycin\nP. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown overnight in LB medium at 37°C with agitation. After growth,\nthe culture of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was diluted with Biofilm Broth (BB) medium as described\nby Khalilzadeh et al. [44] and 25 μl of the diluted culture was added to 470 μl of BB medium\n(initial A600nm of culture comprised between 0.14 and 0.16) supplemented with 5 μl of DMSO\n(1%, v/v) or OALC (200 μM) or naringenin (4mM) or naringin (4mM). Planktonic bacteria\nwere transferred in sterile tube and assessed for cell counting (colony-forming units, C.F.U).\nAdherent biofilms were washed three times with water (2mL) and fixed with 2 mL of methanol\n(99%). After 15 min, the methanol was discarded, and the plates were dried at room tempera-\nture. Crystal violet (0.1% in water) was then added to each well (2 mL/well), and the plates\nwere incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Crystal violet was then discarded, and stained\nbiofilms were washed three times with 1 mL of water. Acetic acid (33% in water) was added to\nthe stained biofilms (2 mL) in order to solubilize the crystal violet, and the absorbance of the\nsolution was measured at 590 nm with a SpectraMax M2 device (Molecular Devices).\nThe biofilm formation by PAO1 cells was also examined in glass coverslips cultures by fluo-\nrescence microscopy. Two distinct assays were adopted in order to assess the effects of\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n6 / 32\n\ncompounds in biofilm development and in one-day-old biofilm. In both cases, the bactericidal\nactivities of tobramycin in one-day-old biofilm-encapsulated PAO1 cells was also assessed.\nTobramycin was chosen because it has been shown that QS inhibition greatly enhances the\nsensitivity of P. aeruginosa to this antibiotic and increases clearance of P. aeruginosa in a for-\neign-body infection model [28, 45]. First assay follows the same culture conditions as described\nabove. After 24 h incubation, tobramycin (100 μg mL-1) was added to 1-day-old treated bio-\nfilms. The biofilm development and bacterial viability in biofilms were assessed using the\nLIVE/DEAD baclight bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen, Molecular probes). The growth\nmedium was removed and replaced by 500 mL of a solution of SYTO 9 and propidium iodide\ndiluted 400 fold in BB medium. Biofilms were incubated for 15 min and PAO1 cells were exam-\nined using a Leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope coupled to a CCD camera (Leica\nDC350 FX) and equipped with FITC and Texas red filters. To estimate the % viability of bio-\nfilm-encapsulated bacteria for each treatment, the glass coverslip was submerged in 2 mL of\nPBS solution and sonicated (WVR Ultrasonic cleaner, HF45KHz, 80W) for 1 min in order to\nunbind the biofilm. The collected biofilm suspension was then assessed for viability using\nLIVE/DEAD baclight bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen, Molecular probes) following fluores-\ncence microplate reader protocols as described by the manufacturer. The integrated intensities\nof the green (530 nm) and red (630 nm) emission of suspensions excited at 485 nm were\nacquired using SpectraMax M2 device, and the green/red fluorescence ratios (Ratio G/R) were\ncalculated and reported to the linear curve obtained from the relationship between % live bac-\nteria and Ratio G/R of biofilm-encapsulated PAO1 cells grown without tobramycin.\nFor the second assay, PAO1 cells were grown statically in BB medium for 24 hours at 37°C\nin 24-well polystyrene plates to form biofilm. Tested molecules as described above and/or\ntobramycin (100 μg mL-1) were added and incubated for a further 24 hours and the biofilm\ndevelopment and bacterial viability in biofilms were assessed as described for the first assay.\nTotal extracellular polysaccharides and alginate quantification\nFor extracellular polysaccharides extraction, the method using ethanol was followed as\ndescribed by Gong et al. [46]. Briefly, P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown at 37°C with agitation at\n175 rpm for 18 h in 5 mL LB-MOPS medium supplemented with OALC (200 μM), naringin or\nnaringenin (4 mM) or DMSO (1%, v/v). The bacterial culture was centrifuged (3200 × g, room\ntemperature, 5 min) and the supernatant discarded.

P. aeruginosa PAO1 (virulent strain), ΔPA1430, (ΔlasR)\nand ΔPA3477 (ΔrhlR) (reduced virulent strains) were grown overnight in LB and then diluted\n100-fold into fresh broth. Brain Heart Infusion agar plates containing either DMSO 1%, OALC\n(200 μM), naringenin (4 mM), naringin (4 mM) or 4-NPO (100 μM) were spread with 400 μl\nof diluted culture and then incubated at 37°C for 24 h to form lawns of bacteria. Synchronized\nculture L4 nematodes or adult wild-type nematodes (From University of Minnesota), obtained\nas previously described [52], were washed off stock plates and suspended in a minimal volume\nof PBS buffer (pH 6.5). One hundred μl of nematodes suspension were placed onto the P. aeru-\nginosa lawns and incubated at 20°C; the droplets dried within 30 min and deposited the nema-\ntodes on the lawn. Likewise, nematodes free of P. aeruginosa were deposited on plates\ncontaining OALC or naringenin or DMSO to evaluate an eventual toxicity. Plates were then\nsealed with parafilm and incubated at 20°C. After 4 h, deposited nematodes were retrieved with\nPBS buffer (pH 6.5) and the obtained worm suspension was transferred into a 15-mL tube and\ncentrifuged (1300 rpm, 2 min), rinsed twice with 5 mL PBS and resuspended in 1 mL PBS for\npreparing the fluorescence revelation of dead worms as described elsewhere [53].

The procedures and\nresults that led to the isolation of the active compound are detailed in S1 Text and S1 Fig. The\nchemical structure of the isolated active compound was elucidated through spectroscopic ana-\nlyzes, including UV, mass and NMR spectral data which are detailed in S2 Text, S2 and S3 Figs,\nleading to its identification as a 3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-al 3-p-coumarate or oleanolic alde-\nhyde coumarate (OALC, MW: 586.52, C39H54O4; Fig 1 and S2 Table).\nThe effect of OALC on lasB and rhlA expression was then evaluated at different concentra-\ntions (from 50 to 200 μM). As shown in S4A and S4B Fig, significant reduction of the expres-\nsion of both genes is observed from 150 μM of OALC. For instance, at 200 μM of OALC\n61 ± 5% of inhibition for lasB and 69 ± 5% of inhibition for rhlA was recorded. To monitor\nthe effect of OALC on global gene transcription, a QS-independent gene, i.e. the isocitrate\nlyase-encoding aceA gene expression was evaluated (see experimental procedures for details).\nAs shown in S4C Fig, aceA expression as well as bacterial growth were not affected by OALC\nat the tested concentrations. Consequently, as more than 50% inhibition in QS gene expres-\nsion was recorded in presence of 200 μM of OALC, this concentration was used in all further\nexperiments. Higher concentrations were not assessed due to limited quantity of purified\nOALC.\nTo evaluate the impact of OALC on P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth and viability, growth kinet-\nics and C.F.U. measurements were recorded in the presence of 200 μM of OALC. As shown in\nS5 Fig, P. aeruginosa growth kinetics and viability were not significantly affected by OALC as\ncompared to the DMSO treatment; this was shown by both culture turbidity measurements\n(S5A Fig) and C.F.U. quantifications after 8 and 18 hours of growth (S5B and S5C Fig). This\nresult suggests that the decrease in QS gene expression and biofilm formation were not due to a\ndrop in cell viability.\nFig 1.

Thus, we assessed the effect of OALC\n(at 200 μM) on the production of three QS-dependent virulence factors, i.e. rhamnolipids, pyo-\ncyanin and elastase. As shown in Fig 2, a drastic inhibition of the production of rhamnolipids\n(75 ± 4% of inhibition; Fig 2A) and pyocyanin (64 ± 3% of inhibition; Fig 2B) was observed\nwhen PAO1 strains were grown in the presence of OALC compared to PAO1 strains grown\nwith DMSO. Additionally, OALC also reduced elastase production (19 ± 4% of inhibition;\nFig 2C) and OALC did not degrade elastine-Congo red in bacteria-free tests (data not shown).\nThe expression of the las- and rhl-dependent virulence factor genes is positively controlled by\nthe transcription factor complexes LasR/3-oxo-C-12-HSL and RhlR/C4-HSL, respectively [9].\nThus, the observed reduction in the expression of lasB and rhlA genes induced by OALC could\nbe linked to a reduction of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL levels in culture media. As shown in Fig\n2D, OALC significantly reduced the concentrations of both auto-inducers after 18 h of growth,\nby 3- and 4-fold for C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL, respectively. To address the matter of whether\nOALC reacts directly with the AHL released in culture medium, LB-MOPS medium supple-\nmented with OALC and/or exogenous AHLs (3-oxo-C-12HSL and C4-HSL) have been incu-\nbated for 18h and AHLs were then extracted and quantified (see experimental procedures for\ndetails). No significant difference in extracted AHLs was observed, suggesting the absence of\nreactivity towards AHLs (data not shown). At this stage, reduction of native AHLs in culture\nmedia is presumably linked to a direct or indirect inhibition of AHLs production by OALC.\nTo address the matter of whether AHLs supply could restore the production of QS-virulence\nfactors in the presence of OALC, 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL were added exogenously to\nOALC-treated PAO1 cells. As shown in S6 Fig, the addition of 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL at\n10 μM (see experimental procedures for details) did not restore the production of pyocyanin or\nelastase in OALC-treated wild-type PAO1 cells (S6A and S6B Fig). The same experiment was\nperformed with the ΔPA1432 and ΔPA3476 mutant strains (which lack functional lasI and rhlI\nsynthetase genes, respectively) to avoid interference with native AHLs (S6C Fig). The exoge-\nnous addition of 3-oxo-C12-HSL to the ΔPA1432 strain significantly increased elastase pro-\nduction, but adding OALC reduced this production to the base level (S6C Fig), confirming that\nan exogenous supply of AHLs is not sufficient to compensate the effect of OALC. As shown in\nS6D Fig, the ΔPA3476 mutant was unable to produce pyocyanin unless C4-HSL was exoge-\nnously supplied (while 3-oxo-C12-HSL had no effect). Similarly to ΔlasI strain, when OALC\nwas added to C4-HSL-induced ΔrhlI cells, the level of pyocyanin production was three-fold\nlower than that observed when C4-HSL alone was added (S6D Fig). These data, consistent with\nthose obtained on the wild type strain PAO1 supplemented with exogenous AHLs, confirm\nthat the reduction of native AHLs induced by OALC is not compensated by exogenous AHLs\nsupply. All together these data indicate that OALC could exert its effect beyond AHLs synthesis\nin the QS pathways. To further document this hypothesis, the expression of QS regulatory\ngenes (lasI/R and rhlI/R) and two global activator genes (gacA and vfr) was investigated.\nOALC affects the expression of lasI/R, rhlI/R and the global activator\ngacA\nAs shown in Fig 3A and 3B, OALC significantly reduces (p \u0001 0.01) the expression of the rhlI\nand lasI genes (39 ± 3% and 33 ± 5% of inhibition, respectively). Similarly, OALC significantly\nreduces the expression of lasR and rhlR genes (35 ± 3% and 50 ± 3% of inhibition, respectively).\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n10 / 32\n\nFig 2.

As shown in Fig 3C, OALC exhibits a small but significant inhibi-\ntory effect on gacA expression (16 ± 4% of inhibition; P \u0001 0.01) but no effect on vfr expression.\nOALC affects biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1\nAs evidenced by the bio-guided chromatographic fractionation (see S1 Fig), OALC inhibits\nbiofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PAO1. To further detail the effect of OALC on biofilm for-\nmation, its effect was compared in two growth media, a minimum and a complex medium (See\nexperimental procedures) as biofilm development is nutritionally conditioned [55]. As shown\nin Fig 4A, OALC significantly reduced the biomass of the PAO1 biofilm in both minimal and\ncomplex media (44 ± 4% and 36 ± 5%, respectively). Additionally, in minimal media, a signifi-\ncant increase of planktonic bacteria is recorded compared to DMSO (Fig 4B), suggesting that\nOALC promotes planktonic bacteria lifestyle instead of biofilm.\nVisualization of P. aeruginosa biofilm by fluorescence microscopy using SYTO-9 and pro-\npridium iodide (to stain live and dead cells, respectively) indicated that PAO1 grown for 24\nhours in static condition (and with DMSO) forms a thick and homogenous biofilm layer on\ncoverslips with good cell-to-cell connections interspaced by uncolonized surfaces (Fig 5A).\nSimilar biofilms were observed in cells treated with the negative control naringin, although\nconfluent bacterial biofilms were visually less thick as observed with fluorescence microscopy.\nBy contrast, OALC- and naringenin-treated PAO1 cells failed to establish compact cell-to-cell\nattachment resulting in a reduction of microcolonies confluence (Fig 5A). Interestingly, when\napplied to one day-old pre-formed biofilm, both OALC and naringenin disrupted the architec-\nture of PAO1 biofilm, as shown by the presence of aggregates and less confluent microcolonies\n(Fig 5B). On the contrary, application of DMSO- and naringin on one-day-old biofilms had no\nimpact (Fig 5). This result suggests that important components for PAO1 biofilm formation\nand structure maintenance are impaired in the presence of OALC.\nMajor PAO1 phenotypes contributing to biofilm formation, including\nswarming, twitching motilities and extracellular polysaccharides, are\naffected by OALC\nTo invade surfaces, P. aeruginosa uses swarming and twitching motilities; both processes are\nunder QS regulation and contribute to the initial stages of biofilm formation and architecture\n[56–58]. As shown in Fig 6, PAO1 swarming was significantly affected when grown onto LB\nagar supplemented with OALC or naringenin but not when DMSO and naringin were supple-\nmented to the medium (Fig 6A). This reduction of bacterial motilities by OALC could contrib-\nute to reducing their ability to form confluent microcolonies (Fig 5A).\nFluorescence microscopy analyses revealed distinct micro-morphological alterations of the\nadherent bacteria and biofilm matrix after OALC and naringenin treatment, suggesting the dis-\nruption of matrix components (Fig 5). Consistently, the amount of extracellular polysaccha-\nrides produced by PAO1 after 24 hours of growth was reduced in OALC- and naringenin-\ntreated PAO1 cells (40 ± 4% and 66 ± 5%, respectively) compared to the DMSO treatment (Fig\n7A). However, the production of alginate, an acidic polysaccharide composed of non-repeating\nsubunits of D-mannuronic and L-guluronic acid [59], was not significantly different compared\nto the DMSO treatment (Fig 7B). Thus, the global reduction of extracellular polysaccharides is\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n13 / 32\n\nFig 4.

For that, tobramycin has\nbeen selected because it is widely used to treat acute P. aeruginosa exacerbations in patients\nwith cystic fibrosis [60] but appears less effective in biofilm-encapsulated P. aeruginosa com-\npared to their planktonic counterparts [61]. Moreover, EPS has been demonstrated to be a bar-\nrier for antibiotic attacks by limiting the penetration of tobramycin [62, 63]. As shown in Fig 8,\nOALC in association with tobramycin significantly increased the effectiveness of the antibiotic\nagainst biofilm-encapsulated bacteria. Indeed, tobramycin introduced at 100 μg mL-1 in one\nday-old biofilm-encapsulated PAO1 cells was found to kill 90 ± 5% of OALC-treated biofilm\ncells (ie, OALC was introduced during the initial growth of PAO1 to form one day-old biofilm)\n(Fig 8A), whereas tobramycin alone could kill only 36 ± 4% (Fig 8B).

Synchronized culture of wild type L4 adult nema-\ntodes obtained as described previously [52] (See experimental procedures for details) were\ntherefore deposited on a lawn of PAO1 pre-treated with OALC, naringenin, naringin, DMSO\nor 4-NPO (a reference QSI agent) [50]. After 4 hours of incubation, dead worms were counted\nfollowing fluorescence revelation as previously described [51, 53]. As shown in S7A Fig, more\nthan 80% of the worms died within 4 hours onto plates containing PAO1 conditioned with\nDMSO 1%. When treated with 4-NPO (100 μM) or with OALC (200 μM), the wild-type PAO1\nstrain could kill only 27 ± 2% and 52 ± 2% of the worms, respectively. Similar results were\nobserved with naringenin (52 ± 4% of dead worms). QS-defective strains ΔlasR and ΔrhlR pre-\ntreated in the different conditions induce only 20 to 30% of nematode death after 4 hours (S7B\nand S7C Fig). However, naringenin at 4 mM and OALC at 300 μM (not 200μM) turned out to\nbe toxic to C. elegans, with a death count of about 60 to 65% (S7D Fig).\nDiscussion\nAntimicrobial resistance is undoubtedly a growing worldwide public health threat so that the\nWHO foresees the emergence of a ‘post-antibiotic’ era during the 21st century in which com-\nmon infections and minor injuries will have a dramatic impact on human death toll [2, 66].\nInfection control using strategies inhibiting bacterial virulence and/or biofilm formation are\nincreasingly explored as anti-pathogenic approaches because they are thought to minimize the\nselection pressure and the concomitant emergence of resistances experienced with strategies\ntargeting basic cell mechanisms and leading to pathogen’s death [29, 67]. In the case of P. aeru-\nginosa, several chemical structures (synthetic and natural) have been reported so far to present,\nat the same time, anti-QS, anti-biofilm and in-biofilm antibiotic-synergizing activities [68].\nThe hemisynthetic compound azithromycin (AZM, a macrolide antibiotic) was found to pres-\nent both QS and biofilm inhibitory effects in P. aeruginosa when used at sub-bactericidal con-\ncentration [2.67 μM] [69]. A number of natural compounds have also been demonstrated to\naffect QS-controlled gene expression in P. aeruginosa and to reduce biofilm production; these\ninclude, among recently reported, 6-gingerol [at 10 μM] (a pungent oil of fresh ginger) [70],\neugenol from clove [at 50 μM][71], ajoene [at 100 μM] (an allyl sulfide from garlic) [45], S-\nphenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide [at 1 mM] [72] and some flavonoids (the flavan-3-ol catechin [at 4\nmM] [35] from Combretum albiflorum and naringenin [at 4 mM] [33]). Herein, OALC exerts\nits activity at 200 μM in the range of other compounds reported elsewhere.\nIn the present report, the bio-guided fractionation of D. trichocarpa bark extract led to the\nisolation and identification of an oleanolic aldehyde coumarate (3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-al\n3-p-coumarate or OALC) as a novel QSI and anti-biofilm compound without bactericidal\neffect. D. trichocarpa is traditionally used along the west coast of Madagascar as local medicine\nto treat various ailments such as laryngitis, diarrhea and rheumatic pains [73]. Besides, the\nantimicrobial activity of extracts from Dalbergia species including D. parviflora Roxb. and D.\nhorrida Dennst. has also been reported and was mainly attributed to flavanone and isoflavone\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n20 / 32\n\nderivatives [74–76]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of\nOALC in any genus/species of plant or other organisms. However, a closely related derivative,\noleanolic acid coumarate, has been previously isolated from Jatropha curcas L. [77] and Hippo-\nphae rhamnoides L. [78] and was shown to present an antimycobacterial (Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis) activity [79]. Besides, Hu et al. [80] demonstrated that a closely related com-\npound, 20β-hydroxyursolic acid coumarate, isolated from leaves of Diospyros dendo inhibits\nbiofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1; though, this compound was not screened for anti-\nQS activities.\nIn P. aeruginosa PAO1, OALC at 200 μM seems to display a large number of biological\nactivities including QSI and anti-biofilm activities that implies multiple cellular targets. Indeed,\nOALC inhibits QS-regulatory (lasI/R and rhlI/R), QS-regulated (lasB and rhlA), global activa-\ntor gacA genes expression (Fig 3) and alters biofilm formation and maintenance (Figs 4 and 5).\nMultiple studies demonstrate that QS systems contribute to the ability of bacteria to form bio-\nfilms [81, 82]; for instance, P. aeruginosa defective in QS are compromised in their ability to\nform biofilms [81, 83]. In the case of OALC, one can assume an indirect link between QS and\nbiofilm formation through the control of essential components such as polysaccharides (Fig 7)\nand rhamnolipids (Fig 2) production, as well as swarming and twitching motility (Fig 6), that\nare all negatively regulated by OALC. Indeed, inactivation of the rhlA gene (crucial for rham-\nnolipids biosynthesis) causes an inhibition of swarming motility and reduces twitching motility\n[41, 84]. In addition, it has been reported that P. aeruginosa strains limited in swarming motil-\nity form biofilms containing non-confluent cell aggregates [58], a phenotype similar to that\ninduced in OALC-treated PAO1 biofilm (Fig 5). In the same line, twitching motility, which has\nalso been shown to be regulated by the rhl system [85], is necessary for the assembly of a P. aer-\nuginosa cell monolayer into microcolonies [86]. Moreover, mutants deficient in rhamnolipids\nsynthesis fail to maintain open channels, which are necessary for distribution of nutrients and\noxygen within the biofilm matrix [87]. In addition, rhamnolipids are involved in microbial cell\nadhesion and biofilm development [88]. A reduction of rhamnolipids production as suggested\nby the down regulation of rhlA expression by OALC, might result in a decreased development\nor a disruption of developing biofilms. Thus, rhamnolipids reduction in OALC-treated PAO1\n(Fig 2) as well as failure in swarming and twitching motilities (Fig 6) also contribute to explain\nthe ability of OALC to disrupt preformed biofilm in P. aeruginosa (Fig 5). Similarly, it was\nrecently shown that phenazine binding to extracellular DNA is important for P. aeruginosa\nbiofilm formation (Das et al., 2015) [89]. Indeed, authors demonstrated significant decrease in\nbiofilm formation by the P. aeruginosa ΔphzA-G mutant and enhancement in ΔphzA-G bio-\nfilms in the presence of exogenous pyocyanin. Since OALC reduces the production of pyocya-\nnin (one of the phenazines produced by P. aeruginosa; Fig 2), biofilms might also be disrupted\nby a lack of pyocyanin in the extracellular matrix, thereby weakening the biofilm structure.\nExopolysaccharides are considered as crucial components for biofilm formation and its\nmaintenance in P. aeruginosa. Indeed, most Pseudomonas strains, including PAO1 strain, rely\non Psl and Pel polysaccharides for cell-surface, cell-to-cell interactions as well as for adherence\nto host cells [62] and for biofilm formation [23, 90, 91]. As total extracellular polysaccharides\nproduction is reduced upon treatment with OALC (Fig 7), a lower availability in Psl and Pel is\nreasonably considered. Although we didn’t quantify Psl production, the hypothesis that OALC\ntargets Psl biosynthesis and/or accumulation in biofilm matrix could explain the disruption in\nbiofilm structures observed in one day-old biofilms treated with OALC (Fig 5B). Indeed, Psl\nfunctions as a scaffold, holding cells together in the biofilm matrix [90] and the psl operon is\nalso essential for biofilm formation in PAO1 strains, as Psl is involved in both early- and late-\nstages of biofilm development as well as in the maintenance of biofilm structure so that pre-\nformed biofilm can be structurally affected in absence of continuous Psl supply [90, 92]. In\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n21 / 32\n\ncontrast, one can assume that the sole inhibition of Pel polysaccharide production could not\nexplain the negative impact in biofilm formation by PAO1 as ΔpelD mutant have been shown\nto not exhibit significant reduction in biofilm formation compared to PAO1 wild type [93]. As\na consequence of polysaccharide defects induced by OALC (Fig 7), biofilm biomass is reduced\n(Fig 4) and planktonic lifestyle is promoted (Fig 4B) and further experiments are now required\nto determine if OALC promotes biofilm dispersal, particularly production of c-di-GMP, small\nregulatory RNAs (RsmY and RsmZ) as well as flagellar motility should be investigated as they\nare intimately implicated in biofilm dispersion [94].\nThe negative effect of OALC on las and rhl systems was correlated with a significant reduc-\ntion in the corresponding concentrations of inducer signals, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL,\nrespectively (Fig 2). However, the reduction of native AHLs is not compensated by exogenous\nAHLs supply (S6 Fig), indicating that OALC target is beyond AHLs synthesis in the QS path-\nways. Therefore, we hypothesized that the starting point for the disruption of QS (inhibition of\nlas and rhl systems) and biofilm formation (mainly the reduction in polysaccharides and rham-\nnolipids production as well as bacterial motility) could be associated with the inhibition of\ngacA expression by OALC (see Fig 10 for the proposed inhibition cascade). In this model, the\ntwo-component regulatory system GacS/GacA that normally inactivate the RNA binding\nFig 10. Proposed targets and inhibition cascade occurring in P. aeruginosa in presence of OALC. In P.\naeruginosa, OALC inhibits gacA gene expression (key component of GacS/GacA/Rsm signal transduction\npathway) leading to an increased level of free RsmA [95]. The latter negatively regulates las and rhl systems\nleading to inhibition of rhamnolipids, pyocyanin and elastase production [9] as well as components involved in\nbiofilm formation and maintenance, including motilities (swarming and twitching) and Psl/Pel productions\n[107] independently of QS systems. Exopolysaccharides production is also reduced directly by RsmA [99].\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791.g010\nTriterpenoid Coumarate Ester Disrupts Biofilm Formation in PAO1\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132791\nJuly 17, 2015\n22 / 32\n\nprotein, RsmA [95] are presumably impaired at gacA gene level. Consequently, an increase of\nfree RsmA should be observed which lead to the repression of lasI and rhlI gene expression and\ntherefore, the inhibition of bacterial behaviors (including motilities and biofilm formation) and\nextracellular virulence factors controlled by the las and rhl systems [96, 97]. Likewise, regula-\ntions of Pel and Psl production are also presumably disrupted as high levels of free RsmA\nrepress psl and pel expressions and therefore disrupt biofilm formation [98, 99].\nThe in vitro ability of OALC to “weaken” the biofilm matrix as a physical barrier protecting\nencapsulated bacteria cells against antibiotics is probably at the origin of the observed OALC-\ntobramycin synergistic activity (Figs 8 and 9). As a result, the antibiotics may better penetrate\ninto the biofilm layers, acting efficiently on bacterial cells more than it could be in structured\nmature biofilm where antibiotics fail to reach entire bacterial population within the matrix.\nOur data indicate that this OALC-tobramycin synergistic activity could depend on the\nobserved reduction in polysaccharides production (see Fig 7). Consistently, previous studies\nhave shown that PAO1 biofilm polysaccharides (Pel and Psl, particularly) confer protection\nagainst aminoglycoside antibiotics [23] and fast-acting antibiotic defense by affecting the inter-\naction between antibiotics and bacterial cell wall [62, 100]. Thus, synergistic effect of OALC is\nnot linked to an increase of bactericidal activity but rather in an increase of availability of tobra-\nmycin inside biofilm matrix. Moreover, several studies corroborate that degraded or at least\nweakened-biofilm by anti-biofilm compounds through anti-QS or other mechanisms enhance\nantibiotic action against bacterial biofilms although no mechanism has been clearly proposed\nby authors [101, 102].\nAnti-virulence propriety of OALC was further evidenced by using C. elegans, one of the sim-\nplest invertebrate models for studying the P. aeruginosa-host interactions [103]. Previous stud-\nies demonstrated that P. aeruginosa PAO1 kills C. elegans but the QS-deficient lasR and lasI\nrhlI double mutant strains which fail to produce fully AHLs presumably like PAO1 in presence\nof OALC (Fig 2), appear strongly attenuated in this virulence model [50, 51]. Herein, pre-\nincubation of PAO1 with OALC considerably reduced the expression of bacterial pathogenic\ntraits, although the treatment was less efficient compared to the reference compound 4-NPO\n(S7 Fig).\nIn this study, although the concentration of 200μM is higher than azithromycin (2.67 μM)\nand is hardly feasible for clinical treatment [69], OALC appears as a potent chemical backbone\ncandidate for further structure-activity studies. OALC is composed of two moieties; an olea-\nnane-type triterpene bearing a p-coumaroyl group. Bodini et al. [104] have demonstrated that\np-coumarate exhibits a QSI effect in Chromobacterium violaceum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nand P. putida. Moreover, other studies indicate that oleanolic acid inhibits the in vitro biofilm\nformation by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [105, 106]. Accordingly, the dual effect of OALC on\nboth QS regulation and biofilm formation could be linked to the coumaroyl and oleanane\ngroups, respectively. Thus, detailed quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of the\nvarious radicals and cycles as well as the substitutions of the ester link might shed light on the\nchemical functions required for the anti-QS and anti-biofilm activities of OALC and might\nlead to more active and stable compounds, with reduced toxicity; an important criteria for\ndrug development.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Text.

Accordingly, fraction 4 was selected\nfor further fractionation by prep-HLPC to yield the active subfraction F4-5 and F4-7 (S1B Fig).\nHowever, only purified compound from subfraction F4-7 (30 mg) was further characterized\ndue to limited quantity of purified compound from subfraction F4-5 (3 mg).\n(DOCX)\nS2 Text. Structural elucidation of the active compound as oleanolic aldehyde coumarate.\nThe active compound was isolated as a white powder and was visualized on TLC plate as a\npinkish-purple dark spot following spraying with a vanillin-H2SO4 reagent, suggesting the\noccurrence of a terpenoid skeleton [108]. The UV spectrum profile (λmax: 203, 226, 308.8 nm)\nsuggested the presence of a 4-oxygenated cinnamic acid derivative [109, 110] (S2A Fig). The\nESI-MS (rel. int. %) analysis of active compound revealed a [M−H]−pseudo-molecular peak\nion at m/z 585.52 (100), five peaks at m/z 293.06 (10), 621.14 (72), 623.15 (32), 1207.25 (18)\nand at m/z 1170.98 (30) (S2B Fig). 1H-NMR spectrum showed two obvious groups of signals,\none group corresponding to a terpenoid moiety and the other group to a cinnamic acid moeity\n(S3 Fig). One proton showed singlet at δ 9.40 indicating H-28 in carbonyl carbon; the typical\nsignals for the olefinic double bond H-12 of the structure were obvious from one broad singlet\n(or t-like) at δ 5.34 (1H) and one proton doublet of doublets at δ 4.61 (J = 8.80, 7.60 Hz), sug-\ngesting the presence of H-3. Two doublets (1H each) at δ 6.30 (J = 16.0 Hz) and δ 7.61 (J = 16.0\nHz) are evidence of the presence of trans-coupled protons H-8' and H-7', respectively. Two\ndoublets (2H each) at δ 6.82 (J = 8.4 Hz) and δ 7.43 (J = 8.4 Hz) are assignable to aromatic pro-\ntons H-3', 5' and H-2', 6', respectively [111, 112]. The 13C NMR spectrum of the active com-\npound also exhibited characteristic signals for one ester carbonyl group at δ 167.4 (S2 Table),\nfour olefinic carbons at δ 123.4 (C-12), δ 143.2 (C-13), 144.3 (C-7’) and δ 116.4 (C-8’), four\naromatic signals at δ 116.1 (C-3’, 5’), δ 127.4 (C-1’), δ 130.1 (C-2’, 6’), and δ 158.0 (C-4’), and\none hydroxylated carbons at δ 81.0 (C-3). At this stage, by comparison of their physical and\nspectroscopic data (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) with those reported in the literature, the above-\ndescribed characteristics of active compound present some similarity to cinnamoyl triterpenes,\nsuch as the p-coumaroyloleanolic acid isolated from Hippophae rhamnoides branch bark and\nBauhinia purpurea bark [78, 113] and, more recently, the (3β)-(4-hydroxy-E-cinnamoyl)\nolean-5,12-dien-28-ol isolated from Crotalaria incana leaves [114]. Finally, unambiguous\nassignment of the active compound was achieved through 2D NMR [1H-1H correlation spec-\ntroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple\nbond correlation (HMBC) and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)] experiments\n(S3 Fig). Based on these spectroscopic data, the active compound was identified as a 3β-\nhydroxyolean-12-en-28-al 3-p-coumarate or oleanolic aldehyde coumarate (OALC, C39H54O4)\n(Fig 1).\n(DOCX)\nS1 Table.

Imlay1,#\n1Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801\nSummary\nHydrogen peroxide pervades many natural environments, including the phagosomes that mediate \ncell-based immunity. Transcriptomic analysis showed that during protracted low-grade H2O2 \nstress, Escherichia coli responds by activating both the OxyR defensive regulon and the Fur iron-\nstarvation response. OxyR induced synthesis of two members of the nine-step heme biosynthetic \npathway: ferrochelatase (HemH) and an isozyme of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF). \nMutations that blocked either adaptation caused the accumulation of porphyrin intermediates, \ninadequate activation of heme enzymes, low catalase activity, defective clearance of H2O2, and a \nfailure to grow. Genetic analysis indicated that HemH induction is needed to compensate for iron \nsequestration by the mini-ferritin Dps. Dps activity protects DNA and proteins by limiting Fenton \nchemistry, but it interferes with the ability of HemH to acquire the iron that it needs to complete \nheme synthesis. HemF is a manganoprotein that displaces HemN, an iron-sulfur enzyme whose \nsynthesis and/or stability is apparently problematic during H2O2 stress. Thus the primary \nresponses to H2O2, including the sequestration of iron, require compensatory adjustments in the \nmechanisms of iron-cofactor synthesis. The results support the growing evidence that oxidative \nstress is primarily an iron pathology.\nIntroduction\nLife evolved in an anoxic world and now must find ways to persist in an oxic one. One of \nthe key oxidative threats to oxygen-tolerant organisms is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This \nspecies is constantly formed within aerobic cells via the adventitious oxidation of redox \nenzymes (Massey et al., 1969; Seaver & Imlay, 2001b; Imlay, 2013). Virtually all organisms \nemploy catalases and peroxidases to keep the steady-state level of endogenous H2O2 below \nthe threshold of toxicity. However, H2O2 is also formed in extracellular environments \nthrough the chemical oxidation of reduced thiols or metals, through photochemistry, through \nthe redox-cycling of antibiotic molecules, through the release of H2O2 by lactic-acid \nbacteria, and most prominently through the deliberate actions of the NADPH oxidases of \namoebae, plants, and mammalian phagocytes (Bedard et al., 2007; Mehdy, 1994; Glass et \nal., 1986). Hydrogen peroxide is small and uncharged, so it readily crosses cell membranes \n#Corresponding author: (217)-333-5812; fax 217-244-6697; jimlay@illinois.edu.\n*Current address: Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nMol Microbiol.

Once inside the cell H2O2 exerts both static and lethal effects. The \nkey goals of the field are to identify the injuries that H2O2 creates and to reveal the \nstrategies that cells use to avoid or mitigate them.\nStudies of H2O2 lethality in the model organism Escherichia coli determined that cell death \nwas due to DNA damage, which arose via the Fenton reaction (Imlay et al., 1988):\n(1)\nThe cell maintains a pool of unincorporated iron that is used to metallate nascent iron \nproteins (Srinivasan et al., 2000). This loose iron sticks to the surfaces of biomolecules, \nincluding nucleic acids, and the DNA damage arises when hydroxyl radicals made at that \nsite react with the DNA (Rai et al., 2001).\nThose studies were conducted by adding millimolar concentrations of H2O2 to relatively \ndense cultures of bacteria, and their relevance could be questioned because such high \nconcentrations are unlikely in natural habitats. Some clarity was reached through the \ninvestigation of the OxyR response, an inducible defense system that was first studied in \nenteric bacteria. OxyR is a transcription factor that is activated when H2O2 oxidizes its \nsensory cysteine residue, triggering the formation of a disulfide bond that locks the protein \ninto an activated conformation (Lee et al., 2004). In this form it stimulates the transcription \nof a set of operons that are scattered around the chromosome. Careful study revealed that as \nlittle as 0.1–0.2 μM intracellular H2O2 is sufficient to activate the OxyR response (Aslund et \nal., 1999). Because scavenging enzymes reduce the intracellular H2O2 concentration below \nthat of the extracellular environment, it appears that ~ 0.5 μM extracellular H2O2 is an \nactivating dose (Seaver & Imlay, 2001b). Implicitly, this represents a concentration that E. \ncoli recognizes as a hazard.\nProteomics and, later, microarray experiments have identified members of the OxyR regulon \n(Morgan et al., 1986; Zheng et al., 2001). These include AhpCF, originally identified as an \nalkylhydroperoxide reductase and now recognized as an NADH peroxidase that scavenges \nthe endogenous H2O2 (Jacobson et al., 1989; Seaver & Imlay, 2001a; Parsonage et al., \n2008). Catalase G (a.k.a., HPI) is an inducible enzyme that is especially effective at the \nhigher doses of H2O2 that saturate the Ahp system (Seaver & Imlay, 2001a). Dps is a \nferritin-like protein that sequesters intracellular unincorporated iron, thereby greatly \ndiminishing the amount of Fenton chemistry that damages DNA and proteins (Ilari et al., \n2002; Park et al., 2005; Anjem & Imlay, 2012). The Suf proteins form a complex that \nprovides iron-sulfur clusters to apoenzymes; it replaces the housekeeping Isc system, which \nis inactivated during H2O2 stress (Py & Barras, 2010; Jang & Imlay, 2010). The [4Fe-4S] \nclusters of dehydratases are primary targets of H2O2, and the continuous repair of these \nclusters by Suf helps to avert the failure of the TCA cycle and branched-chain biosynthetic \npathways, which contain such enzymes (Jang & Imlay, 2007). Finally, the induction of the \nMntH manganese importer protects non-redox mononuclear enzymes from H2O2 (Kehres et \nal., 2002; Sobota & Imlay, 2011; Anjem & Imlay, 2012; Sobota et al., 2014). The \nmononuclear enzymes normally employ ferrous iron as a cofactor, but during H2O2 stress \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 2\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nthe apparent replacement of that metal by manganese allows activity to be sustained without \nthe threat of Fenton chemistry in the active site. Interestingly, homologues of many OxyR-\nregulon members are induced by H2O2 in bacteria that use PerR as an alternative sensor \nprotein (Lee & Helmann, 2006; Helmann et al., 2003).\nTo test the impact of H2O2 stress upon cell physiology, it would be ideal to expose cells for \nextended periods of time to concentrations of H2O2 that might be encountered in nature. \nUsing the activation point of OxyR as a guide, one estimates that this logic recommends \nH2O2 exposures that cause cytoplasmic H2O2 to moderately exceed 0.2 μM. Unfortunately, \nwhen low-micromolar doses of H2O2 are added to standard cultures as a single bolus, the \ncells degrade the H2O2 far too quickly for growth defects to be detected. In contrast, in \nnature most H2O2 formation is continuous and bacterial densities are typically low, so H2O2 \nlevels are stable and stress is protracted. To achieve a similar situation in the lab, workers \nhave resorted to using redox-cycling antibiotics, which complicate the situation by \nproducing superoxide, or to using catalase- and peroxidase-deficient mutants that do not \ndegrade H2O2. When such mutants of E. coli (ΔkatG ΔkatE ΔahpCF, denoted Hpx− (Seaver \n& Imlay, 2001a)) are cultured in aerobic media, endogenous autoxidation reactions produce \nH2O2 that immediately equilibrates across the cell membrane, establishing an intracellular \nconcentration of ~ 0.5–1 μM (Seaver & Imlay, 2001b). This felicitous dose has proved \nuseful in identifying targets of injury and in demonstrating the roles of OxyR-induced \nproteins.\nIn this study we have employed Hpx− mutants to determine the full transcriptome of E. coli \nduring chronic H2O2 stress. The data replicate the induction of known members of the OxyR \nregulon. In addition, they demonstrate that the combination of iron oxidation and rerouting \ninto Dps leaves the cell iron-deficient. This is problematic for heme synthesis, which under \nthe circumstance is critical for the induction of catalase. The OxyR response resolves the \ndilemma by elevating the titer of ferrochelatase and by replacing the iron-sulfur-dependent \nHemN protein with an iron-independent isozyme. In aggregate the data demonstrate that \nphysiological doses of H2O2 comprise an iron-centric stress.\nResults\nThe transcriptome of H2O2-stressed cells\nZheng and Storz performed a microarray analysis of E. coli during exposure to 1 mM H2O2, \nand their study identified an array of genes that respond to the OxyR transcription factor \n(Zheng et al., 2001). We wished to complement that approach by sequencing the transcripts \nof cells that grew for an extended period in the presence of much lower, physiological levels \nof H2O2. This strategy might reveal shifts in the transcriptome that are driven not only by \nOxyR itself but also by the impact that oxidative stress has upon cell metabolism.\nTo impose chronic oxidative stress we used Hpx− strains, which lack the primary H2O2-\nscavenging activities. Because H2O2 is constantly formed inside cells by the autoxidation of \nredox enzymes, aerated Hpx− mutants accumulate ~ 1 μM intracellular H2O2. The OxyR \ntranscription factor is activated when levels of H2O2 exceed ~ 0.2 μM, and so Hpx− strains \nfully express the OxyR regulon. In normal H2O2-stressed cells the OxyR-driven induction of \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 3\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nthe KatG catalase imposes a requirement for substantial heme synthesis, and this demand \nmight have its own consequences. To test this possibility, we used a katG allele in which the \ndeletion of a polypeptide loop eliminates catalase activity and yet preserves the ability of the \nprotein to bind heme (Li & Goodwin, 2004). In addition, the heme status of this enzyme can \nbe tracked because the presence of the heme allows the protein to exhibit dye-peroxidase \nactivity in cell extracts. Thus in this strain, which we denote as Hpx2−, chronic H2O2 stress \noccurs (Fig. S1). This situation mimics the experience of bacteria in natural habitats that \ncontain constant sources of exogenous H2O2.\nPrior studies indicated that H2O2 stress disrupts biosynthetic pathways and iron homeostasis \n(Jang & Imlay, 2010; Sobota et al., 2014; Varghese et al., 2007; Jang & Imlay, 2007). These \neffects are obscured when cells are grown in classic LB broth, an extremely rich medium \nthat provides ample nutrients and high levels of iron. Therefore the Hpx2− strain was instead \ngrown in a minimal glucose medium. The only other biomolecules that were supplied were \nPhe, Trp, and Tyr, since even low levels of H2O2 block their biosynthetic pathway (Sobota \net al., 2014). Cells were systematically maintained in early exponential phase for at least 10 \ngenerations prior to RNA harvest (Materials & Methods) so that their physiology had fully \nadapted to H2O2-stress conditions. The doubling times under these conditions were 49 +/− 1 \nmin for three parallel cultures of wild-type cells and 138 +/− 7 min for three Hpx2− cultures \n(Fig. S2).\nTable S6 represents the transcriptome of the Hpx2− mutant compared to that of unstressed \nwild-type cells. Several patterns are immediately clear. Virtually all of the most strongly \ninduced genes belong to the OxyR, SOS, or Fur regulons (Table S1). Derepression of the \nOxyR regulon was no surprise, and all genes known to be within it were substantially \ninduced (Table S2). Activation of the SOS response indicated that at least some of the cells \nstruggled to replicate their DNA, presumably due to oxidative lesions arising from Fenton \nchemistry (Park et al., 2005; Goerlich et al., 1989; Asad et al., 1997). Expression of the Fur \nregulon indicated that the Fur repressor lacked its ferrous cofactor. This effect could derive \nfrom several factors. H2O2 directly oxidizes the solvent-exposed iron atoms of mononuclear \nproteins, causing the iron to dissociate (Anjem & Imlay, 2012), and such an effect would \ndirectly deactivate Fur protein (Varghese et al., 2007). The chemical oxidation of ferrous \niron by H2O2 might additionally lead to ferric deposition upon molecular surfaces, \ndiminishing ferrous iron availability. Finally, Dps, a ferritin-like protein that was strongly \ninduced by OxyR, depletes the cellular pool of ferrous iron by sequestering it (Altuvia et al., \n1994; Ilari et al., 2002; Park et al., 2005).\nThe shrinking of cellular iron pools constitutes a problem for the assembly of iron-\ncontaining cofactors. Enzymic iron-sulfur clusters are initially built upon a scaffold protein \nby the Isc machinery (Roche et al., 2013). This system fails during iron starvation or H2O2 \nstress, and in both circumstances the cell responds by inducing the suf operon (Kehres et al., \n2002; Nachin et al., 2003; Jang & Imlay, 2010). The Suf system comprises a secondary iron-\nsulfur assembly system that is particularly adept at building clusters when iron levels are \nlow (Outten et al., 2004). Iron is also incorporated into heme, and so we were interested to \nknow whether heme synthesis might be problematic during H2O2 exposure. If so, it seemed \nlikely that analogous adaptations might be incorporated into the stress response, particularly \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 4\nMol Microbiol.

This issue is the focus of this \nreport.\nhemH is induced by OxyR during H2O2 stress\nThe synthesis of heme entails nine reactions that convert glutamyl-tRNA to protoporphyrin \nIX. Ferrochelatase, encoded by hemH, then completes the process by inserting a ferrous iron \natom (Fig. 1A). Microarray experiments by Zheng and Storz identified hemH as a member \nof the E. coli OxyR regulon; no other hem genes were implicated (Zheng et al., 2001). Their \ndata indicated that hemH was induced 11-fold when cells were exposed to a bolus of 1 mM \nH2O2. DNase I footprinting indicated that the regulation by OxyR was likely to be direct \n(Zheng et al., 2001). Our transcriptome data indicated that hemH was induced 14-fold in the \nHpx2− strain. We also observed that the hemF gene was induced 6-fold, while the eight \nother hem genes remained at basal levels (Fig. 1B).\nOur investigation focused first upon the rationale for hemH induction. In the Hpx2− strain \nkatG transcription was induced 60-fold. Because rapid catalase synthesis would elevate \nheme demand, we took a further look to see whether part or most of the OxyR-dependent \ninduction of hemH might be mediated by a yet-unidentified transcription factor that senses a \ndrop in the heme pool. To do so we used RT-PCR to compare the degree of hemH induction \nin the Hpx2− strain, which synthesizes the heme-binding (but inactive) catalase protein, with \nthat of an Hpx− strain in which the katG gene has been fully deleted. We found that the \ndegree of induction was equivalent in the two strains (Fig. 2A). The same result was \nobtained using hemH′-lacZ+ fusions (Fig. 2B). Induction was equally rapid (Fig. S3). \nMoreover, quantitatively similar induction occurred when unstressed wild-type cells were \ntransformed with the poxyR2 plasmid, which encodes a constitutively active form of OxyR \n(Fig. 2A). We conclude that during H2O2 stress OxyR specifically induces hemH, which fits \nthe footprinting data of Zheng and Storz. Further, there is no apparent transcriptional \nfeedback to hemH arising from the elevated heme demand itself.\nHemA levels are not elevated during H2O2 stress\nWe sought to verify that hemH and hemF were distinct among the hem genes in being \ninduced during H2O2 stress. HemA (glutamyl-tRNA reductase) catalyzes the first dedicated \nstep in heme synthesis (Fig. 1), and prior studies suggested that under standard conditions \nthis reaction is rate-limiting for pathway flux (Woodard & Dailey, 1995; Jones & Elliott, \n2010). If the basal levels of heme synthetic enzymes were inadequate for full catalase \ninduction, one might expect HemA levels to rise during H2O2 stress. Therefore this gene \nwas the most likely target for any transcriptional control. Although the published microarray \nstudies had not identified hemA (or any hem gene other than hemH) as responsive to H2O2 \nexposure (Zheng et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2009; Dwyer et al., 2014), this result was not \ndefinitive: the millimolar H2O2 doses that were used in those experiments were sufficient to \nblock protein synthesis and thus would not have triggered any increase in heme demand. In \ncontrast, the Hpx2− RNA sequencing data was obtained under conditions in which catalase \nsynthesis had been induced for an extended time; those data showed a very minor increase in \nhemA transcription (Fig. 1). This result was double-checked with a hemA′-lacZ+ construct. \nFusion expression was only slightly higher (~ 1.7 times) in the Hpx2− cells than in non-\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 5\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\ninduced wild-type cells (Fig. S4). Moreover, an equivalent effect was observed in the \ncatalase-null Hpx− cells, indicating that the minimal transcriptional activation was not \nattributable to an increase in heme demand. The introduction of the poxyR2 plasmid into \nwild-type cells caused the strong induction of catalase synthesis but did not trigger \nsignificant hemA expression. Thus neither OxyR activation per se nor rapid catalase \nsynthesis boosts hemA transcription.\nRecent work has suggested that HemA levels can respond to heme sufficiency at the level of \nprotein lifetime: when intracellular heme levels are adequate, HemA binds heme and \nbecomes vulnerable to rapid degradation by the Lon and ClpAP proteases (Wang et al., \n1997; Wang et al., 1999; Jones & Elliott, 2010). Conversely, heme scarcity triggers \nstabilization of heme-free HemA protein. In principle, during H2O2 stress HemA quantities \nmight keep pace with heme demand via this post-transcriptional mechanism. However, \nwestern blot analysis demonstrated that HemA protein levels were no different in Hpx2− \nstrains with high catalase synthesis than in wild-type cells where catalase synthesis was far \nlower (Fig. S4). These results imply that even during H2O2-mediated induction of catalase \nsynthesis, most enzymes in the pathway—including the usual rate-determining one—are \nfully adequate. The implication, then, is that H2O2 stress somehow creates a situation in \nwhich the ferrochelatase step becomes a specific bottleneck, and hemH induction by OxyR \nmay be a way to solve that problem.\nH2O2-stressed cells are inefficient at providing heme to enzymes\nIf heme synthesis is difficult during H2O2 stress, the activation of heme proteins may lag \nbehind their synthesis. Indeed, enzyme assays of heme-dependent enzymes revealed activity \ndefects. After 3 hours of aeration, the KatG protein titers in the Hpx2− strain were 14-fold \nhigher than in the unstressed wild-type strain, consistent with the transcriptional induction of \nkatG by H2O2-activated OxyR (Fig. 3A). However, the KatG-dependent peroxidase activity \nwas elevated only 2.6-fold, suggesting that much of the enzyme lacked heme. The other \nprominent heme-requiring proteins in aerobic cells are the cytochrome bo and bd oxidases \nthat terminate the respiratory chain (Table S3). Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared, \nand NADH oxidase activity was assayed. Activity in the Hpx− strain was only 40% that of \nwild-type cells. In the Hpx2− strain, which induces heme-containing KatG, the level was \nfurther reduced to 23% (Fig. 3B). This NADH oxidase activity depends upon the activities \nof both NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase; specific assays showed near-normal \nlevels of NADH dehydrogenase activity, indicating that the oxidase failure represented low \ncytochrome oxidase function (Fig. S5). The transcriptome analysis showed that both enzyme \ncomplexes were transcribed at normal rates, so that the lack of the heme cofactor was the \nprobable culprit for the reduced oxidase activity. The enzyme defect is even larger than \nthese numbers suggest, since in wild-type membranes the NADH dehydrogenase constitutes \nthe rate-limiting step; thus some decline in cytochrome oxidase activity occurs before \noverall oxidase flux is diminished. This decline could potentially exacerbate problems with \nheme synthesis, as the protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase HemG delivers electrons into the \nrespiratory chain (Mobius et al., 2010). In sum, these data indicate that heme provision to \nheme-requiring proteins is less efficient during H2O2 stress than in unstressed cells, and this \ninadequacy is exacerbated by the induction of heme-requiring catalase.\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 6\nMol Microbiol.

To probe \nthe importance of hemH induction, we deleted the OxyR binding cassette upstream of hemH, \nresulting in a strain in which hemH is non-inducible [denoted hemH(NI)]. A hemH(NI)′-\nlacZ+ fusion was constructed to confirm the effect of this mutation upon transcriptional \nlevels. Loss of the OxyR site did not diminish basal expression of this fusion, but during \nH2O2 stress induction no longer occurred (Fig. 2B).\nThe mutation had only modest effects upon the growth behavior of Hpx− strains, with no \neffect at all in iron-rich LB medium and only a modest slowing in low-iron minimal medium \n(data not shown). However, the combined intracellular levels of protoporphyrinogen IX and \nprotoporphyrin IX, the ferrochelatase substrate, increased 5-fold above normal levels in \nH2O2-stressed Hpx2− cells, and they increased 18-fold when hemH was non-inducible (Fig. \n4).\nThe significance of hemH induction was examined in otherwise wild-type cells under \nconditions in which successful heme synthesis would provide a growth advantage. When \nconfronted with a bolus of exogenous H2O2 (0.5 mM), the wild-type (hemH+) cells resumed \ngrowth after a lag period, but the hemH(NI) cells did not (Fig. 5A). The source of the defect \nis that the wild-type cells were able to induce high titers of catalase activity during the lag \nperiod, whereas the hemH(NI) strain failed to do so (Fig. 5B). Consequently the wild-type \nstrain cleared H2O2 from the medium; the non-inducing mutant did not (Fig. 5C). This \nphenotype was even more consequential than is apparent from measures of biomass. Fig. 5D \nillustrates that the hemH(NI) cultures lost several logs of viability.\nThe increased sensitivity of hemH(NI) strains to H2O2 was also apparent in disk diffusion \nassays (Fig. 6A). For clarity, it was examined in an ahpF mutant background, which lacks \nNADH peroxidase (AhpCF) and therefore relies exclusively upon catalase for H2O2 \nclearance. The ahpF strains constitutively induce low-level expression of the OxyR regulon \nand thus typically display greater H2O2 resistance when challenged with a zone-of-\ninhibition assay (Seaver & Imlay, 2001a), and that effect is apparent in Fig. 6A. Still, the \nhemH(NI) strain showed greater sensitivity than the strain in which hemH was inducible. In \ncatalase-deficient cells the hemH(NI) allele had no phenotype. These data indicate that \nhemH induction is necessary to provide heme for KatG activation during H2O2 stress.\nThe accumulation of porphyrins is also potentially toxic per se, in part because photoexcited \nporphyrins can trigger singlet oxygen formation (Miyamoto et al., 1991). That does not \nappear to be the primary mechanism of poisoning here, as the growth defects that emerged \ncorrelated with the failure to scavenge H2O2, and they persisted when experiments were \nperformed in the dark.\nhemH induction avoids a ferrochelatase bottleneck during iron deficiency\nThe transcriptomic data offered a clue as to why ferrochelatase had special problems during \nH2O2 stress: the availability of its substrate, ferrous iron, was diminished. Indeed, although \nKatG activity was deficient when hemH(NI) cells were confronted with H2O2, it was normal \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 7\nMol Microbiol.

Thus it is H2O2 per se that \ndemands hemH induction, rather than merely heightened flux demand during catalase \nsynthesis.\nThe depletion of cytoplasmic iron results both from its chemical oxidation to the insoluble \nferric form and from the iron-sequestering action of Dps. Several experiments demonstrated \nthat hemH induction was important under conditions of iron deficiency. First, a strong \ngrowth phenotype emerged even at low H2O2 doses when the iron chelator dipyridyl was \nused to deplete iron from the medium of Hpx2− hemH(NI) cultures (Fig. 6B). The need for \nhemH induction was also observed when exogenous H2O2 was added to cells that were iron-\npoor by virtue of mutations in iron importers (Fig. S6). The hemH(NI) strain was especially \nslow to induce KatG activity, with consequent delays in H2O2 degradation and growth.\nWe used disk-diffusion assays to assess the impact of dps induction on the ferrochelatase \nphenotype (Fig. 6A). A dps null mutation suppressed the growth inhibition of hemH(NI) \ncells exposed to H2O2. Sensitivity was restored by plasmids overexpressing Dps and Dpr, a \nDps homologue from Streptococcus mutans, showing that Dps and the ferrochelatase are \ndirect competitors for iron during H2O2 stress. These results indicate that several features of \nH2O2 stress collaborate to deplete the iron pools available for insertion of iron into \nprotoporphyrin IX, with the consequence that the critical induction of active catalase can \nfail. Induction of ferrochelatase is a key mechanism of compensation.\nHemF is a second heme biosynthetic enzyme induced by OxyR\nThe sixth step of the heme biosynthetic pathway, the oxidative decarboxylation of \ncoproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, is catalyzed by two isozymes, encoded \nby hemN and hemF (Fig. 1). HemN is a SAM-radical enzyme with an iron-sulfur cluster, \nand the enzyme reduces SAM to methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine (Layer et al., 2006). In \ncontrast, HemF employs molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor; therefore, HemF is \nfunctional only in aerobic environments. HemF is notable because it is a rare E. coli enzyme \nthat appears to require manganese as its prosthetic metal (Breckau et al., 2003).\nPrior microarray studies did not note evidence of hemF induction during H2O2 stress (Zheng \net al., 2001; Lee et al., 2009), but Mukhopadyay and Schellhorn reported that the gene was \ninduced 1.8-fold in when cells were exposed to 60 μM H2O2 (Mukhopadyay & Schellhorn, \n1997). Data suggested that this effect was OxyR-dependent. Because wild-type cell cultures \nrapidly scavenge exogenous H2O2, their single-bolus experiments might not have elicited \nfull induction. Our transcriptomic data indicated 6-fold induction in Hpx2− cells, and RT-\nPCR analysis showed that hemF transcripts were induced 6.5-fold in Hpx− cells (Fig. 8A). A \nsimilar induction occurred in unstressed cells that harbored the poxyR2 plasmid. Thus \ninduction is substantial.\nUsing 5′-RACE we found that during routine growth the hemF transcriptional start site is \nlocated 243 bp upstream of the hemF ORF, within the 3′ end of the upstream amiA ORF; \nhowever, in Hpx2− cells the predominant start site lies 30 bp further upstream, suggesting \nthat OxyR enables RNA polymerase to bind to a new site (data not shown). OxyR binding \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 8\nMol Microbiol.

The \nsimilarity of induction in catalase-expressing Hpx2− and catalase-free Hpx− strains indicated \nonce again that the gene was not responding to increased heme demand. Because HemF can \nuse manganese as a cofactor, we considered the possibility that hemF induction might be \ncoupled to manganese availability, so that the OxyR effect was an indirect consequence of \nits induction of the MntH manganese importer. However, the poxyR2 plasmid induced hemF \nas effectively in a mntH null mutant as in the wild-type background, indicating that \nmanganese availability does not cause hemF induction (Fig. 8A). We conclude that hemF is \napparently an authentic member of the OxyR regulon.\nHemF supersedes HemN as a coproporphyrinogen III oxidase during H2O2 stress\nFollowing the logic of the hemH investigation, we tested whether HemF synthesis was \nimportant during H2O2 stress. Because cytochrome oxidase activity is essential for aerobic \ngrowth, a ΔhemN ΔhemF double mutant that cannot synthesize heme was viable only in \nanoxic medium, where E. coli ferments. Both of the ΔhemF and ΔhemN single mutants were \nable to grow at normal rates in the presence of oxygen, indicating that either protein is \nsufficient for heme synthesis in unstressed cells (Fig. S7). However, during H2O2 stress, \nHemN is no longer adequate. In oxic glucose medium an Hpx2− ΔhemF strain exhibited a \nmild growth defect relative to an Hpx2− hemF+ strain (Fig. S8). This phenotype was more \npronounced in LB medium, where catabolism is more dependent upon respiration (Fig. 8B). \nIt was fully complemented (Fig. S9). Furthermore, in the Hpx2− background a ΔhemF \nmutation diminished KatG peroxidase and cytochrome oxidase activities, whereas a ΔhemN \nmutation was without effect (Fig. 9). The cytochrome oxidase defect was lessened in ΔkatG \ndeletion strains (Hpx−, compared to Hpx2−), wherein heme demand is reduced. This pattern \nwas pronounced in non-fermentative LB medium (Fig. S10). Manganese supplementation \nelevated the activities of heme-containing enzymes in all strains except those containing \nΔhemF mutations, consistent with its role in activating HemF (Fig. 9). These data all \nindicate that during H2O2 stress the induced mangano-enzyme HemF becomes the critical \ncoproporphyrinogen III oxidase.\nMeasurements of intracellular coproporphyrinogen III pools confirmed this interpretation \n(Fig. 10). The pools were undetectably small in both wild-type and Hpx2− strains. The \nΔhemN mutation alone had little or no effect, either in unstressed or Hpx2− strains. \nHowever, inside Hpx2− ΔhemF mutants this porphyrin rose to a high level.\nBecause it employs a [4Fe-4S] cluster, we wondered whether the inadequacy of HemN was \ndue to its poisoning by H2O2. However, unstressed poxyR2 cells that overexpress the OxyR \nregulon—and, with it, the KatG protein—were also unable to fully charge the enzyme using \nHemN alone (Fig. 7). Thus basal levels of HemN cannot support a high pathway flux even \nin the absence of H2O2 stress, whereas HemF is able to do so. The induction of hemF by \nOxyR might be an important element in ensuring that HemF titers are sufficient, but we \nwere unable to test this idea through promoter manipulation, since this promoter is located \nwithin amiA, an important cell-wall enzyme. Of course, the fact that HemN titers are \ninadequate for high flux even without H2O2 stress does not rule out the possibility that \nHemN is additionally vulnerable to H2O2 (see Discussion).\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 9\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nMutants lacking HemF cope poorly with H2O2 stress\nThe preceding experiments were conducted in Hpx2− backgrounds in which KatG was \nunable to degrade H2O2. However, problems with heme synthesis will generate the strongest \nphenotypes under conditions in which catalase activity actively detoxifies the environment. \nIndeed, in wild-type katG+ backgrounds ΔhemF mutants were unable to cope with \nexogenous H2O2 (Fig. 11A–B). In contrast, the ΔhemN strain that could express hemF was \nable to perform as well as the wild-type strain. Measurements of the viability of strains \nlacking the NADH peroxidase (AhpCF)—which therefore relied exclusively on the catalase \nfor H2O2 degradation—revealed that hemF was needed not only to avoid cell stasis but also \nto avoid death. A similar result was observed in zone-of-inhibition experiments, in which the \nbacteria encounter H2O2 as a time-dependent gradient of increasing concentration (Fig. \n11C). This experimental design optimizes the opportunity for induction. In sum, during \nH2O2 stress HemF is needed to achieve high heme synthetic fluxes, and rapid heme \nsynthesis is needed to maintain cell fitness. HemN, an iron-sulfur enzyme that is adequate \nduring routine growth, is insufficient in this situation.\nDiscussion\nOxidative stress is perhaps the most common threat experienced by organisms in natural \nhabitats. Variability in oxidant resistance shapes the biota is such clear ways that a basic \ndescription of a microorganism starts with its classification as an aerobe, microaerophile, or \nanaerobe. Still, our understanding of the mechanisms by which oxidants damage cells is not \nyet complete, nor do we have a full command of the defensive strategies by which \norganisms defend themselves.\nProgress has been greatly facilitated by analysis of the bacterial OxyR response, one of the \nfirst defensive regulons that was defined using contemporary transcriptomics. In this study \nRNA-sequencing data emphasized that H2O2 stress creates a global crisis in iron utilization \nand that this problem ramifies to the synthesis of heme as a cofactor for catalase. Since \ncatalase provides a primary defense against H2O2, the function of the two iron-requiring \nenzymes in that pathway becomes problematic, and the OxyR response has evolved to \nremedy the situation.\nA crisis in iron availability: induction of HemH protein\nAll the well-characterized injuries produced by H2O2 start with its oxidation of iron: DNA \ndamage (Park et al., 2005), inactivation of [4Fe-4S] dehydratases (Jang & Imlay, 2007) and \nmononuclear iron enzymes (Sobota & Imlay, 2011; Sobota et al., 2014; Anjem & Imlay, \n2012), inhibition of the Isc system (Jang & Imlay, 2010), and derepression of the Fur \nregulon (Varghese et al., 2007). All these reactions are derivatives of the basic Fenton \nreaction, where inner-sphere electron transfer from ferrous iron to H2O2 produces a \nhydroxyl radical. This species is itself toxic, causing the covalent oxidation of DNA and \npolypeptide residues.\nThe fact that H2O2 damage derives almost exclusively from iron might seem surprising, \nbecause the cell contains several biomolecules—including thiols, flavins, and quinones—\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 10\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nwith a lower reduction potential. But the d-orbitals of transition metals like iron and copper \nlower the activation energy of H2O2 reduction by stabilizing the radical that is formed, as \nevidenced by the fact that the Fenton reaction produces a ferryl radical, rather than a free \nhydroxyl radical, as the immediate product (Rush et al., 1990; Imlay et al., 1988). Because \nE. coli systematically excludes copper from its cytoplasm (Dupont et al., 2011), ferrous iron \nis left behind as the biomolecule most reactive with H2O2. Thus the cellular adaptation to \nH2O2 is centered around minimizing the amount of intracellular ferrous iron. Ferritins keep \nintracellular pools at moderate levels during routine growth (Andrews et al., 2003; Touati et \nal., 1995), and during periods of H2O2 stress the induction of Dps drives them lower (Ilari et \nal., 2002; Park et al., 2005).\nThe problem with this arrangement is that iron pools are needed for the activation of \nmononuclear iron enzymes, iron-sulfur proteins, and heme proteins. In Hpx− cells the \nderepression of the Fur regulon indicates that the combination of Dps synthesis and \nchemical iron oxidation drives ferrous levels quite low. Previous work showed some \nstrategies that the H2O2-stressed cell uses to sustain iron-enzyme activation. The induction \nof the MntH importer rescues the mononuclear enzymes, apparently by providing \nmanganese as a substitute for their iron atoms (Anjem et al., 2009; Sobota & Imlay, 2011; \nAnjem & Imlay, 2012). Induction of Suf enables cluster synthesis to continue, since the Suf \nmachinery can function effectively even when iron levels drop too low for the standard Isc \nmachinery (Jang & Imlay, 2010).\nBut heme synthesis is potentially the most problematic of all. When moderate levels of \nH2O2 inactivate the NADH peroxidase (Ahp), the induction of catalase is the sole way to \ndrive the H2O2 levels back down (Seaver & Imlay, 2001a). The data indicate that the two \niron-dependent steps of heme synthesis—coproporphyrinogen III oxidation and \nprotoporphyrin IX metallation—are both at risk, and the inductions by OxyR of \nferrochelatase and HemF are critical adaptations. The problem is not simply the increase in \nheme demand. Recent ribosome profiles of glucose-grown E. coli (Li et al., 2014) indicate \nthat in unstressed cells KatG represents only 7–10% of the heme proteins (Table S3); thus its \n14-fold induction during H2O2 stress approximately doubles the heme demand of the cell. \nMost cofactor biosynthetic pathways are synthesized with excess capacity and, as we \ndiscovered for heme, show little evidence of product-dependent feedback regulation at the \ntranscriptional level. (This statement applies to thiamine, pyridoxamine, flavin, \npantothenate, lipoate, quinone, and folate synthesis, but not to nicotinamide, which cells \nrequire at millimolar rather than micromolar levels.) We presume this excess capacity \nexplains why catalase induction does not require the induction of the other heme \nbiosynthetic genes. In fact, an exception that proves the rule is the observation that in \nBacillus subtilis many heme genes belong to its H2O2-response regulon, as this bacterium \ninduces catalase to such enormous levels that in perR mutants it rises to 10% of the total cell \nprotein (Faulkner et al., 2012).\nThus the induction of ferrochelatase is apparently a strategy to sustain heme synthesis \ndespite the depletion of the ready pool of ferrous iron, the ferrochelatase substrate. Notably, \nE. coli apparently does not use frataxin or any analogous chaperone to protect a supply of \niron from Dps and H2O2. Disk diffusion assays revealed that a null mutation of a frataxin \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 11\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nhomolog, encoded by cyaY, did not have any impact on the H2O2 sensitivity of hemH(NI) \nstrains (data not shown). Moreover, ΔcyaY mutants did not exhibit defects in iron-enzyme \nactivities, either in wild-type or Hpx− backgrounds.\nDps puts a strain on iron metabolism when it sequesters the iron pool, and several features of \nthe protein suggest that cells are quick to deactivate it when the H2O2 threat has passed. \nFirst, in vitro experiments indicate that Dps uses H2O2 as a co-reactant when Dps oxidizes \nand stores the iron (Chiancone & Ceci, 2010). If so, once the H2O2 is gone, Dps should stop \nscavenging iron. Second, the expression of dps can be blocked by the manganese-bound \nform of the MntR repressor (Yamamoto et al., 2011). This arrangement suggests that the \nprimary purpose of iron sequestration is to ensure that manganese, rather than iron, occupies \nthe divalent-metal binding sites in mononuclear proteins. Indeed, Hpx− dps and Hpx− mntH \nmutants both suffer incapacitating levels of protein oxidation due to Fenton chemistry, and \nthis damage can be avoided by manganese supplements (Anjem et al., 2009). As soon as \nsufficient manganese has been imported, restrictions on iron content can be relieved. Finally, \nthe Dps protein has a terminus that targets it for rapid turnover by the ClpXP protease \n(Stephani et al., 2003); thus, once H2O2 has been scavenged, OxyR-dependent Dps \nsynthesis ends, and extant Dps protein is quickly degraded. The OxyR response is an \ninteresting example in which a cellular adaptation to stress creates secondary problems of its \nown, which in turn have been minimized by multi-layered control features.\nWhy is HemF induced in place of HemN during H2O2 stress?\nThe coproporphyrinogen III oxidase of E. coli is unique among the heme synthetic enzymes \nin that its activity can be supplied by either of two isozymes, HemN and HemF. All other \nheme synthetic steps depend on single enzymes. We construe HemN as the housekeeping \nenzyme because it can function in anoxic as well as oxic habitats, in contrast to the oxygen-\ndependent HemF, and because HemN is quantitatively four-fold more abundant even under \naerobic conditions (Li et al., 2014). Similarly, HemN appears to be the primary \ncoproporphyrinogen III oxidase in aerobic Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite the presence of \nHemF (Rompf et al., 1998).\nOur data showed that HemN becomes inadequate during periods of H2O2 stress. Why? \nSeveral non-exclusive explanations are plausible. First, this step might simply be rate-\nlimiting for the pathway, as it has been reported to be in mammals during erythroid \ndifferentiation (albeit with a distinct enzyme) (Severance & Hamza, 2009). This would not \nexplain, however, why an isozyme of a different constitution is induced during H2O2 stress. \nSecond, HemN is a SAM-radical enzyme and therefore relies upon a [4Fe-4S] cluster for \nfunction. Indeed, its synthesis is repressed in iron-starved cells (Troup et al., 1995). Because \nH2O2 depletes iron and directly interferes with Isc-dependent cluster synthesis, HemN \nactivation might be difficult in environments where H2O2 stress is chronic.\nE. coli expresses eight other SAM-radical enzymes—for thiamine, lipoate and biotin \nsynthesis, RNA modification, and glycyl-radical-enzyme activation. One might expect their \nsynthesis to become problematic during H2O2 stress, too, but unlike HemN they do not have \ncompensatory isozymes. Presumably the key difference is that during H2O2 stress a slow-\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 12\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\ndown in heme synthesis can be catastrophic, because of its role in catalase activation, \nwhereas impedance of these other pathways is less consequential.\nThe other vulnerability of HemN might stem from the physical exposure of its [4Fe-4S] \ncluster. Iron-sulfur dehydratases are poisoned by H2O2 because it directly oxidizes their \nclusters to unstable valences. The HemN cluster can be similarly accessed by small solutes, \nas evidenced by the ability of soft metals to disrupt it in vivo (Djoko & McEwan, 2013; \nAzzouzi et al., 2013), and so it seems possible that H2O2 might directly bind and oxidize it. \nMore work is needed to test this idea. In any case, the induction of a manganese isozyme \nduring oxidative stress would avoid all these problems. This adaptation mirrors the induction \nof the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, rather than the housekeeping iron \nenzyme, when oxidants activate the SoxRS system (Fridovich, 1986). The activation of \nHemF constitutes a second reason for MntH induction by OxyR.\nFinally, it is intriguing that the heme synthetic pathways in eukarya exclusively employ \nHemF rather than HemN (Cavallaro et al., 2008). This arrangement, too, mirrors that of \nsuperoxide dismutases: eukaryotic mitochondria contain a manganese isozyme but not an \niron one. They have also dispensed with the iron-sulfur-dependent fumarase, routinely using \na cluster-free fumarase C isozyme, which E. coli induces only when oxidative stress is \nsensed. In these regards eukarya seem to constitutively express the defensive strategies that \nE. coli resorts to only under oxidative duress. And at the extreme of the spectrum lie lactic \nacid bacteria, which routinely generate millimolar concentrations of H2O2 as a by-product of \ncentral metabolism (Pericone et al., 2003). These bacteria potentially profit if the H2O2 \npoisons their competitors. To avoid toxifying themselves, they have eschewed the \ndehydratases that contain labile [4Fe-4S] clusters, they routinely import millimolar levels of \nmanganese that probably cofactor their mononuclear enzymes in place of iron, and they do \nnot synthesize heme at all (Baureder & Hederstedt, 2013). The adaptive strategies of E. coli \napparently mimic the evolutionary strategies by which organisms cope with oxidative stress.\nThe global view: transcriptional responses to physiological levels of H2O2\nWe examined the transcriptional response when E. coli contended with the ~1 μM H2O2 that \naccumulates in Hpx− mutants. The use of this strain is a convenient way of imposing a \ndegree of chronic H2O2 stress that slightly exceeds the trigger for OxyR activation. Wild-\ntype (scavenger-proficient) cells would experience a similar intracellular dose when they are \nexposed to ~ 5 μM extracellular H2O2, which might be found in a variety of natural habitats. \nNotably, calculations suggest that phagocytosed bacteria confront steady-state levels of \nH2O2 similar to this (Winterbourn et al., 2006; Imlay, 2009; Burton et al., 2014).\nThe overall picture was surprising clear: of the fifty operons that responded most strongly to \nH2O2 in this study, all but two are known members of the OxyR, SOS, or Fur regulons. The \ndata provide an interesting comparison to the microarray results of Zheng and Storz (Zheng \net al., 2001). Their study detected most of the OxyR-controlled genes, but it also detected \nthe induction of OxyR-independent genes that do not overlap at all with our OxyR-\nindependent gene set. The key difference stems from the experimental protocol. As Zheng \nand Storz recognized, the millimolar dose of H2O2 that they used would rapidly activate \nOxyR, but it would also be sufficient to block cell growth and to oxidize transcription \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 13\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nfactors that are not significantly affected by micromolar concentrations. Another difference \nis that our Hpx− strain was cultured for many generations prior to RNA harvesting, and so \nthe RNA-seq analysis also detected cellular responses to progressive DNA damage \naccumulation (the SOS response) and to the impact that OxyR-driven adaptations imposed \nupon iron metabolism (Fur derepression). The requirement for hemH and hemF induction \napparently results from the latter disturbance of iron metabolism.\nThe genes that exhibit strong H2O2-sensitive phenotypes (dps, fur, yaaA, mntH, \nsufABCDSE, katG, ahpCF, xthA, recA, hemH, and hemF) were all induced in the Hpx− \nmutants. Thus an interesting note is that many genes that have been hypothesized to play \nkey roles in oxidative stress were not induced (Table S6). These include soxS and the \nregulon it controls, which fits with the observation that the SoxR protein is not easily \noxidized by physiological doses of H2O2 (Manchado et al., 2000; Gu & Imlay, 2011). The \nlist also includes genes encoding methionine sulfoxide reductases (msrA and msrB), \nperiplasmic defensive systems (degP, cpxA, dsbB, ompF, skp), the cysteine and glutathione \nsynthetic pathway (cysA, cysJ, gshA, gshB, etc.), the Hsp33 disulfide-activated chaperone \n(hslO), RpoS-dependent defensive enzymes (sodC, cfa, bolA, etc.), and the mutT/mutM/\nmutY troika that collectively avoid the effects of the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into \nDNA. The fact that the cell has not evolved to increase the titers of these proteins suggests \nthat the injuries that they address may not be generated in significant amounts during \nphysiological H2O2 stress. Indeed, we have not observed growth defects when most of these \ngenes are deleted from Hpx− cells. We suspect that these proteins fix injuries that are \ngenerated in other ways. Nevertheless, more work must be done to make this conclusion \ndefinitive.\nModerate activation of the SOS regulon was evidenced in the Hpx− strains by induction of \nthe cryptic e14 bacteriophage genes, recN, sulA, tisB, umuCD, dinB, recA, and other regulon \nmembers (Table S1). The SOS response has usually been studied as a recovery phenomenon \nduring the period after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, such as UV radiation; however, \nin the H2O2-stressed cells the response was detected while growth and DNA replication \ncontinued. Hpx− ΔrecA mutants, which cannot activate the SOS response, gradually die in \naerobic medium (Park et al., 2005), indicating that potentially lethal amounts of DNA \ndamage occur throughout the full population and that the SOS response is a key element in \nH2O2 resistance. The idea that SOS induction does not always interrupt replication and cell \ndivision fits the model that the response is a graded one. Members of the regulon differ in \nhow easily they are induced by DNA damage, apparently in accordance with the numbers \nand positions of their LexA binding sites (Courcelle et al., 2001). The low-grade stress \nsuffered by our Hpx− strains did not rise to the level of blocking cell septation, for example. \nThe standard stresses that have been used to study the SOS response—intense UV radiation, \nDNA-damaging chemicals, and topoisomerase inhibitors—are unlikely to be the real-world \nstresses that the SOS system evolved to confront. It may be that oxidative lesions are a \nnatural source of SOS induction. This thought is supported by parallels between the SOS \nresponse that we observed and that of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae maintains a \nsmall SOS regulon whose LexA-type repressor appears to be directly deactivated when \nH2O2 oxidizes a sulfhydryl residue (Schook et al., 2011), a mechanism similar to the \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 14\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nactivation of OxyR. Further, the primary member of the N. gonorrhoeae regulon is recN—\nthe SOS-controlled repair enzyme that was most strongly induced in our Hpx− cells. Thus \nmicromolar H2O2 might be a predominant activator of SOS in natural environments.\nThe psp and norRVW genes were strongly induced despite lying outside of the OxyR, SOS, \nor Fur regulons. The “phage shock protein” system senses membrane stress (Jovanovic et \nal., 2014), but the physical nature of the signal during H2O2 accumulation is unclear and is \nworthy of further investigation. NorW and NorV comprise a two-component nitric oxide \nreduction system that has no obvious role during H2O2 stress. Their induction may be an \naccidental consequence of the oxidation of the iron cofactor of NorR, the transcription factor \nthat activates transcription of the three nor genes (Tucker et al., 2008). NorR employs a \nferrous iron atom to sense nitric oxide by directly binding it; in Hpx− cells, however, H2O2 \nis likely to oxidize the iron atom, and the resultant ferryl radical would be expected to \nfurther oxidize its coordinating cysteine residue, as with other mononuclear iron proteins \n(Anjem & Imlay, 2012; Sobota et al., 2014). If so, the induction of this operon may be one \nmore example of the impact of adventitious Fenton chemistry.\nFinally, a recent report suggested that YchF, an ATPase, is a negative regulator of the \noxidative stress response and is repressed by OxyR (Wenk et al., 2012). We did not observe \nany impact of H2O2 stress upon ychF expression. Further, although YchF was proposed to \ndirectly bind and inhibit KatG in unstressed cells, a ΔychF mutant exhibited the same \nactivity as did a wild-type cell (data not shown), in contrast to that previous report. It is not \nclear whether some aspect of growth condition influences the behavior of YchF.\nExperimental procedures\nReagents\nD-glucose and Tris base were purchased from Fisher Scientific; ethylenediaminetetraacetic \nacid disodium salt dehydrate (EDTA) and xylenol orange disodium from Fluka; Amplex \nRed from Molecular Probes; ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents from Amersham; \nglacial acetic acid from J.T. Baker Chemicals; and 6 mm blank paper disks from Beckton, \nDickinson and Co. Acid-hydrolyzed casamino acids (Hy-Case Amino), L-amino acids, \nchloramphenicol, ampicillin, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), ethyl acetate, \nsorbitol, 2,2′-dipyridyl o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), o-dianisidine \ndihydrochloride, NADH, potassium ferricyanide, potassium cyanide, ferrous ammonium \nsulphate hexahydrate, manganese (II) chloride tetrahydrate, 30% H2O2, type II horseradish \nperoxidase, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat IgG were obtained from \nSigma-Aldrich. Rabbit serum containing anti-KatG IgG was a kind gift of Dr. Peter Loewen. \nRabbit serum containing anti-HemA IgG was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.\nGrowth conditions\nAnoxic growth was performed in an anaerobic glove box (Coy Laboratory Products) under \nan atmosphere of 85% nitrogen, 10 % hydrogen and 5 % carbon dioxide. Aerobic cultures \nwere grown in the open laboratory with vigorous shaking. All the cultures were incubated at \n37°C. For all the experiments, overnight cultures were diluted in the appropriate medium to \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 15\nMol Microbiol.

To prevent DNA damage, oxygen-sensitive strains were precultured anoxically. \nMid-log cells were then diluted into fresh aerobic medium to an OD600 = 0.005–0.02 (as \nspecified below) for subsequent experiments. OD600 was used to monitor cell growth. \nStandard glucose medium consisted of minimal A salts (Miller, 1972) plus 0.2% glucose, 5 \nmg ml−1 thiamine, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM aromatic amino acids, and 0.5 mM histidine. \nHistidine was supplied because the parental strain (MG1655) is a histidine bradytroph under \nanoxic conditions, and aromatic amino acids were supplied because aromatic biosynthesis is \ninhibited by the low doses of H2O2 that accumulate in the oxic media of Hpx− strains \n(Sobota et al., 2014). Glucose/amino acids medium contained 0.2 % casamino acids and 0.5 \nmM tryptophan in place of aromatic amino acids and histidine. LB contained (per liter) 10 g \ntryptone, 10 g NaCl and 5 g yeast extract. Glucose/amino acids or LB media were used in \nexperiments involving high doses of H2O2, which otherwise blocks branched-chain \nbiosynthesis.\nBacterial strains and strains construction\nThe strains used in this study are listed in Table S4. The construction of all the oxygen-\nsensitive strains was performed under anaerobic conditions to ensure that suppressor \nmutations were not selected during outgrowth. Null mutations were created by using the λ \nRed recombinase method (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000). The mutations were moved to the \ndesired background by P1 transduction (Miller, 1972) and confirmed by polymerase chain \nreaction (PCR) analysis. When necessary, the resistance marker was removed—leaving a flp \nscar sequence—by transformation with pCP20, followed by removal of the temperature-\nsensitive plasmid (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000).\nThe chromosomal hemH(NI) allele had much of the OxyR binding site removed and \nreplaced with the flp scar sequence. This mutation was achieved by the λ Red recombinase \nmethod and confirmed by PCR analysis. The genomic region comprising -204 to −36 from \nthe start site, corresponding to bases 497051–497220 of E.coli genome, was removed in the \nhemH(NI) mutant allele. This deletion removed the majority of the OxyR binding cassette, \nwhich is located between −63 and −25 from the start site (Zheng et al., 2001), and did not \nmodify the overlapping −35 promoter region or the 5′ UTR of the transcript.\nSingle-copy lacZ transcriptional fusions to hemH, hemH(NI) and hemA promoter regions \nwere integrated into the λ attachment site, thereby leaving intact the native genes \n(Haldimann & Wanner, 2001; Hasan et al., 1994). The promoter regions were PCR \namplified using 5′-TATATACTGCAGATTCGAAAGCGCGCACGGAC-3′ and 5′-\nATATATGAATTCCATTACCGCCTCTTATCGATTC-3′ for hemH, 5′-\nTATATACTGCAGAAAAATCCTCGGCTAATTCG-3′ and 5′-\nATATATGAATTCCATTACCGCCTCTTATCGATTC-3′ for hemH(NI), and 5′-\nTATATACTGCAGGGGGTATAGTGATGACAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-\nATATATGAATTCCATGTCTGCGGGAAATAATAC-3′ for hemA. All the primer pairs \nwere designed with PstI and EcoRI recognition sites. The promoter regions were inserted \nbefore the lacZ ORF in the pAH125-derivative CRIM plasmid pSJ501, where the \nchloramphenicol cassette permits anaerobic selection. The resulting plasmids were \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 16\nMol Microbiol.

The constructs were then integrated into \nthe chromosome at the λ attachment site by the integrase provided by pINT-ts, and they \nwere then transduced into appropriate strains. When necessary, the chloramphenicol \nresistance cassette, which is flanked by flp sites, was subsequently removed by means of \npCP20.\nPlasmids and plasmid construction\nThe plasmids used in this work are described in Table S4. The hemF ORF was PCR \namplified from E. coli MG1655 chromosome using the forward primer 5′-\nTATAGAATTCGCACGGCGGCGTTTCGTCAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-\nTATAAAGCTTATCAGCGGATGCGGGAGTGG-3′. The primers were designed to \ninclude EcoRI and HindIII recognition sites. The hemF ORF was inserted into the pBR322 \nvector, generating the pSM16 plasmid.\nIllumina RNA-sequencing\nAnoxic precultures of three independent isolates of each strain were grown until exponential \nphase (OD600 ~ 0.1–0.15). Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 7000×g, and pellets were \nresuspended in fresh oxic medium to obtain an initial OD600 ~ 0.005. Cultures were \nincubated aerobically with vigorous shaking until they reached an OD600 ~ 0.1–0.15. Total \nRNA was isolated from cells by hot phenol extraction. Briefly, 1.6 ml (2×800 μl) of each \nculture was mixed with preheated phenol-water and fresh 8xlysis solution (20 mM Na-\nacetate, pH 5.2, 0.5 % SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 in DEPC water) and incubated × 15 min \nat 65 °C with vigorous shaking. After centrifugation at 13000 × g at 10 min at RT, the top \nlayer was transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes containing 700 μl of phenol-chloroform. The \nphenol-chloroform extraction was repeated twice. The upper aqueous layer was transferred \ninto clean Eppendorf tubes containing 1.3 mL EtOH and incubated 90 min on dry ice. After \ncentrifugation at 13000×g at 10 min at 4°C, the supernatants were discarded and the RNA \npellets were rinsed with 500 μl 75 % EtOH. The precipitated RNA pellets were air dried and \nresuspended in 40 μl RNAse free TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA). \nContaminating genomic DNA was removed from the isolated RNA samples by DNase \ntreatment using RNase-free DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to the \nmanufacturer’s instructions. The construction of libraries from mRNA and sequencing on \nthe HiSeq 2000 were performed by the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. Briefly, \nribosomal RNA was removed from total RNA with the RiboZero Bacteria kit from \nEpicentre/Illumina. The RNAseq libraries were prepared with Illumina’s ‘TruSeq Stranded \nRNAseq Sample Prep kit’. The libraries were pooled, quantified by qPCR, and sequenced \non one lane for 101 cycles from one end of the fragments on a HiSeq2000 using a TruSeq \nSBS sequencing kit version 3. Reads 100 nt in length were generated, and Fastq files were \nproduced with the software Casava 1.8.2 (Illumina). RNA-Seq reads were aligned with the \ngenome of Escherichia coli MG1655 to generate gene counts that were used for differential \ngene expression analysis, which was performed by the Bioinformatics unit.\nMancini and Imlay\nPage 17\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nAll studies were performed upon cells that had been carefully cultured to the point of \nexponential growth. For RT-PCR measurements of gene expression, exponentially growing \nanaerobic precultures were diluted into fresh oxic medium to OD600 = 0.005 and grown with \nvigorous shaking until cells reached an OD600 ~ 0.1–0.15. Two ml of each culture were \nmixed with 2 volumes of RNA-protect bacterial reagent (Qiagen) and incubated 10 min at \nroom temperature. RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy minikit (Invitrogen) \nfollowing the manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by \nthe isolated RNA samples by DNase treatment using RNase-free DNase I (New England \nBiolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dilutions (1/10) of the RNA samples \nwere PCR amplified. The lack of product visualized by gel electrophoresis confirmed the \nabsence of contaminating genomic DNA. One μg of the DNA-free RNA samples was used \nto synthesize cDNA with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) according to the \nmanufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression of hemF and hemH was analyzed using the \nprimers listed in Table S5. Expression was normalized to the signal of the rrsG gene (16S \nribosomal RNA). PCR amplifications were performed using iQ SYBR® Green Supermix \n(BIORAD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a real-time PCR reaction \nconsisted of a mixture of 10 μl iQ SYBR® Green Supermix (2x), 300 nM forward and \nreverse primer, 2 μl of 1/10 dilution of the cDNA samples, and H2O were combined to reach \na final volume of 20 μl. PCR was carried out in a MasterCycler ep realplex machine \n(Eppendorf) as follows: 3 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 60°C, and 30 \nsec at 72°C. A final melt curve analysis from 55°C to 90°C with 0.5°C increments every 2 \nsec was performed to confirm the presence of single amplificates.\n5′RLM-RACE\n5′ RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) was performed \nusing First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer’s indications. \nRNA isolated from wild-type and Hpx2− cells for the RT-PCR analysis (0.5 μg) was treated \nwith the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) to remove the phosphate from full-length \nmRNA. The monophosphate mRNA was ligated to the 5′ RACE adapter and retro-\ntranscribed to cDNA by using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) according to the \nmanufacturer’s instructions. Two subsequent nested PCRs were performed using the \n5′RACE outer 5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′ and inner 5′-\nCGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGGCTTTGATG-3′ adapter forward primers and \nthe gene-specific 5′-AGTCGAAGCCACCGCCAAAC-3′ and 5′-\nATTACGCAACACCCGACTAC-3′ reverse primers for the outer and inner 5′ PCR, \nrespectively. The PCR reactions were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, and the products \nwere gel-purified using Agarose GelExtract Mini Kit (5Prime) and sequenced.\nB-galactosidase activity assay\nExponentially growing anoxic precultures were diluted into fresh oxic medium to an OD600 \n= 0.01 and grown with vigorous shaking for the indicated times. For measurement of hemH′-\nlacZ+ and hemH(NI)′-lacZ+ expression in strains containing poxyR2, overnight cultures \ngrown in oxic LB supplemented with 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol were diluted into oxic \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 18\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nmedium to an OD600 = 0.005 and grown until the mid-log phase at an OD600 ~ 0.1. Cells \nwere harvested by centrifuging 25 ml at 7000×g at 4°C for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed \nin 20 ml cold 0.05 M Tris-Cl (pH 8) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer solution. \nThe cells were lysed by French press, and the cells debris was removed by centrifugation at \n12000×g at 4°C for 10 min. Supernatants were then assayed for β-galactosidase activity \nusing o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate. Accumulation of the \nreaction product o-nitrophenol was monitored at 420 nm (Miller, 1972). Protein \nconcentrations of the supernatants were measured by Bradford protein assay and were used \nto normalize the β-galactosidase specific activities.\nKatG peroxidase activity assay\nThe wild-type KatG enzyme functions in vivo as a catalase, but it also possesses a small \namount of dye-oxidizing peroxidase activity that is physiologically insignificant but which \ncan be used to quantify the active form of the enzyme in cell extracts. In this study we \nfrequently employed a mutant form of the enzyme, denoted KatGΔFG, which lacks the \ncatalase activity but retains the peroxidase activity (Li & Goodwin, 2004). In these strains \nthis activity was used to appraise the efficiency with which heme was being supplied to the \nKatG enzyme. For peroxidase assays, anoxic precultures in glucose medium were diluted \ninto 100 ml of fresh oxic medium ± 10 μM MnCl2 to an OD600 = 0.02. Cells were grown \naerobically with a vigorous shaking for three hours prior to harvesting. For strains carrying \nthe poxyR2 plasmid, the media included 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were washed \ntwice in 20 ml cold 0.05 KPi (pH 7.8), resuspended in 1 ml 0.01 M KPi (pH 6.4), and lysed \nby sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 12000×g at 4°C for 10 min, and \nthe supernatants were used to assay the KatG peroxidase activity by the o-dianisidine \nmethod (Messner & Imlay, 1999). Briefly, extracts were added to 0.3 mM o-dianisidine and \n10 mM KPi (pH 6.4). To start the reaction, 0.9 mM and 9 mM H2O2 were added to measure \nperoxidase activity of extracts containing KatG and KatGΔFG, respectively. The oxidation \nof o-dianisidine was monitored at A460. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were \nmeasured by Bradford protein assay and were used to normalize the peroxidase-specific \nactivities.\nNADH dehydrogenase assay\nAnoxic precultures in glucose medium were diluted into 150 ml of fresh oxic medium ± 10 \nμM MnCl2 to an OD600 = 0.02. Cells were grown aerobically with a vigorous shaking until \nthey reached an OD600 = 0.15–0.2. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 50 mM MES \nbuffer (pH 6) and resuspended in 4 ml of the same buffer solution. Cells were lysed by \nFrench press, forming inverted membrane vesicles, and the cell debris was removed by \ncentrifugation for 20 min at 12000×g at 4°C. The supernatant, which contained the vesicles, \nwas centrifuged at 100000×g at 4°C for two hours and then resuspended in 1 ml pre-chilled \n50 mM MES (pH. 6). MES was used as the buffer because the NADH dehydrogenase I \ncomplex is unstable at higher pH. NADH (120 μM) was added to the membranes inverted \nvesicles, and the total NADH oxidase activity was monitored according to the decrease of \nA340. This activity represents electron flow from NADH through the NADH dehydrogenase \ncomplexes, the quinone pool, and the terminal cytochrome oxidases. The NADH \ndehydrogenase activities themselves were assayed by measurement of NADH:ferricyanide \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 19\nMol Microbiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n\noxidoreductase activity, which depends solely on the dehydrogenases themselves. The \ninverted vesicles were pre-incubated with 3 mM KCN to irreversibly inhibit ~ 95% of \ncytochrome oxidase activity. Then 200 μM K3Fe(CN)6 was added, and absorbance at 420 \nnm was monitored (Siegel et al., 1974).\nH2O2 assays\nBacterial membranes have significant but not unlimited permeability to H2O2. Therefore, in \nhydroperoxidase-deficient (Hpx−) cells, which lack significant scavenging activity (ΔkatG \nΔkatE ΔahpCF), H2O2 rapidly equilibrates in and out the cells, making the extra- and \nintracellular H2O2 concentrations nearly identical (Seaver & Imlay, 2001b). For \nmeasurements of H2O2 accumulation, Hpx− cells were precultured in glucose medium \ncontaining aromatic and histidine amino acids. The exponentially growing cells (OD600 of ~ \n0.1) were diluted to OD600 = 0.005 into 25 ml fresh oxic medium of the same composition \nand grown with vigorous shaking. At intervals 1 ml of the cultures was removed, cells were \nremoved from this aliquot by filtration, and the filtrates were frozen on dry ice. The H2O2 \nconcentrations of the filtrates were measured by the Amplex Red/horseradish peroxidase \nmethod as described previously (Seaver & Imlay, 2001a).\nIn some experiments hydroperoxidase-proficient cells were monitored for the rate at which \nthey degraded a bolus of exogenous H2O2. Precultures in anoxic LB medium were diluted to \nan OD600 = 0.005 into 25 ml fresh oxic LB containing the indicated H2O2 concentrations, \nand cultures were incubated with vigorous shaking. At regular intervals, 1 ml of the cultures \nwas removed, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 12000×g at room \ntemperature, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes and frozen on \ndry ice. The H2O2 concentrations of supernatants were determined as described previously \n(Wolff, 1994). The method involves the oxidation of ferrous ions by H2O2 at low pH via \nFenton chemistry, producing ferric ions that form a colored adduct with the xylenol orange \ndye. Accumulation of this complex was monitored at 560 nm. A standard curve was \ngenerated with known amounts of H2O2.\nH2O2 killing assay\nPrecultures in anoxic LB medium were diluted to an OD600 = 0.001 in fresh oxic LB \ncontaining 0.5 mM H2O2, and cultures were incubated at 37 °C under vigorous shaking. At \nregular intervals, aliquots of cells were removed and serially diluted in LB before being \nplated on LB plates. Colonies were enumerated after overnight incubation at 37°C.\nDisk diffusion assay\nCells were grown overnight in oxic LB medium to stationary phase. These overnight \ncultures were diluted in fresh oxic LB to an OD600 = 0.005 and incubated to OD600 ~ 0.1. \nCell numbers were equalized by the final OD600 in 100 μl LB, mixed with 4 ml LB-top agar \n(0.8%) and spread on LB plates. After 30 min incubation at RT, a 6 mm round paper disk \npre-soaked with 15 μl 1 M H2O2 (10 mM for the ΔkatG strains) was deposited on the center \nof the plate. After 24 h incubation at 37°C the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition \naround the disk was measured. For the experiments performed with strains carrying \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 20\nMol Microbiol.

The cells were centrifuged at 7000×g at 4°C for 10 min, washed in 20 ml \ncold 0.05 M Tris-Cl (pH 8), and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer solution. Cells were \nlysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000×g at 4°C for \n10 min. The protein concentrations of the lysates were measured by Bradford protein assay. \nTen μg of each protein sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to \nnitrocellulose membranes. After blotting with a 5% skim milk solution, 1:100 dilution of \nrabbit serum containing either anti-HemA or anti-KatG was used as primary antibody. The \nrabbit serum containing anti-KatG IgG had previously been incubated with 4 mg of protein \nextract of the Hpx− strain (which lacks KatG) to increase the specificity of the primary \nantibody. A 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat IgG was \nused as the secondary antibody, and the bands were detected by chemiluminescence with the \nECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents.\nExtraction of porphyrins\nAnaerobic precultures in glucose medium were diluted into 400 ml of fresh oxic medium ± \n10 μM MnCl2 to an OD600 = 0.02 and grown aerobically under vigorous shaking in the open \nlab for three hours. Intracellular porphyrins were extracted using a modified procedure \n(Nakayashiki & Inokuchi, 1997). Cells were centrifuged at 7000×g at 4 °C for 10 min and \nwashed in 20 ml cold 0.05 M Tris (pH 8)/2 mM EDTA. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of \nthe same buffer. The OD600 was measured to equalize the cell number of each sample. After \ncentrifugation at 7000×g at 4 °C for 10 min, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml ethyl \nacetate/glacial acetic acid (3:1, v/v). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris \nwas removed by centrifugation at 7000×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The non-aqueous layer was \nwashed two times with 1 ml H2O. Porphyrins were extracted from the organic solvent by the \naddition of 100 μl of 3 M HCl. After a vigorous shaking the aqueous solution was \ntransferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and submitted for LC/MS/MS analysis.\nLC/MS/MS analysis\nSamples were analyzed by the UIUC Metabolomics Center with the 5500 QTRAP \nLC/MS/MS system (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) using a 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent \nTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA) including a degasser, an autosampler, and a binary pump. \nThe LC separation was performed on an Agilent SB-Aqcolumn (4.6×50 mm, 5 μm) (Santa \nClara, CA) with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% \nformic acid in acetontrile). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The linear gradient was as \nfollows: 0–1 min, 100% A; 10–18 min, 5% A; 19–24 min, 100% A. The autosampler was \nset at 5°C. The injection volume was 1 μL. Mass spectra were acquired with positive \nelectrospray ionization (ESI), and the ion spray voltage was 5500 V. The source temperature \nwas 450 °C. The curtain gas, ion source gas 1, and ion source gas 2 were 32, 65, and 50, \nMancini and Imlay\nPage 21\nMol Microbiol.

Ausubel, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, December 20, 2007 (received for review October 5, 2007)\nCytokinesis partitions the cell by a cleavage furrow in animals but\nby a new cross wall in plants. How this new wall assembles at the\nmolecular level and connects with the mother cell wall remains\nunclear. A lethal Arabidopsis embryogenesis mutant designated\nroot-, shoot-, hypocotyl-defective (rsh) provides some clues: RSH\nencodes extensin AtEXT3, a structural glycoprotein located in the\nnascent cross wall or ‘‘cell plate’’ and also in mature cell walls. Here\nwe report that electron micrographs of rsh mutant cells lacking RSH\nextensin correspond to a wall phenotype typiﬁed by incomplete\ncross wall assembly. Biochemical characterization of the puriﬁed\nRSH glycoprotein isolated from wild-type Arabidopsis cell cultures\nconﬁrmed its identity as AtEXT3: a (hydroxy)proline-rich glyco-\nprotein comprising 11 identical amphiphilic peptide repeats with a\n28-residue periodicity: SOOOOKKHYVYKSOOOOVKHYSOOOVYH\n(O \u0001 Hyp), each repeat containing a hydrophobic isodityrosine\ncross-link motif (YVY, underlined). Atomic force microscopy of RSH\nglycoprotein imaged its propensity for self-assembly into a den-\ndritic scaffold. Extensin peroxidase catalyzed in vitro formation of\ninsoluble RSH gels with concomitant tyrosine cross-linking, hence\nthis likelihood in muro. We conclude that self-assembling amphi-\nphiles of lysine-rich RSH extensin form positively charged scaffolds\nin the cell plate. These react with negatively charged pectin to\ncreate an extensin pectate coacervate that may template further\norderly deposition of the new cross wall at cytokinesis.\ncytokinesis \u0002 (hydroxy)proline-rich glycoprotein \u0002 nanotechnology\nP\nlant cells are hydraulic machines. They generate a hydrostatic\npressure that drives cell expansion, rate-limited by a thin\n‘‘primary’’ cell wall. This extracellular matrix has dynamic prop-\nerties and structural integrity, hence an organelle with its own\nunique proteome. Mechanically it is an elastomer–plastomer\ncomposite comprising three interpenetrating networks, two of\nstructural polysaccharides and one of structural glycoproteins\n(1). Each network is internally cross-linked: cellulose microfi-\nbrils by xyloglucans, pectins by calcium salt bridges and apiosyl\nborate esters, and structural (hydroxy)proline-rich glycoproteins\n(HRGPs), notably the extensins, by tyrosine derivatives (2, 3).\nThe integrity of an extracellular matrix depends crucially on\ncorrect self-assembly of its individual components. Mutants with\ndefective glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and hydroxyproline\n(Hyp)-rich collagens are often lethal in animals (4). Likewise,\ndefects in the cell wall or extracellular matrix of green plants (5)\nand related algae (6) also involve Hyp-rich proteins (7), the\nextensins (8). These are highly periodic amphiphilic glycopro-\nteins defined by their conserved hydrophilic and hydrophobic\nregions—short rigid blocks of contiguous O-glycosylated Hyp\nresidues (9), typically hydrophilic Ser-(Hyp)4 motifs. In plants\nthese are interspersed with hydrophobic motifs. Typically these\nare (i) YXY motifs shown in vitro to form isodityrosine (YXY)\n(Idt) and to be involved in intermolecular cross-linking via di-Idt\nformation (3, 10) and (ii) putative intermolecular VYK cross-\nlinking motifs (11). Extensins are secreted as \u000180- to 100-nm\nrod-like monomers (12) with limited flexibility in an extended\npolyproline II (three residues per turn) helical conformation\nfurther stabilized by their glycomodules. Extensin peroxidase\ncatalyzes polymerization of extensin monomers (11) via di-Idt\nand pulcherosine (a tetramer and trimer of tyrosine, respec-\ntively) to yield cross-linked networks in vitro and in muro (13, 14).\nThe Arabidopsis genome encodes 20 closely homologous ex-\ntensin polypeptides [supporting information (SI) Table 4] with\ndistinct patterns of expression at the organ/tissue level (15).\nHowever, lethal knockout of a single extensin gene yielded a\nroot-, shoot-, hypocotyl-defective (rsh) seedling (5) where wild-\ntype RSH corresponded to AtEXT3 (Fig. 1) and localized by\nImmunoGold labeling to the cell plate and mother wall junctions\n(5). Here we further identified this lesion at the electron\nmicroscope level as defective cell wall assembly that could be\nascribed to the absence of AtEXT3. As an extended amphiphilic\ncell wall protein with Idt motifs, AtEXT3 has evident potential\nfor self-recognition, cross-linking, and scaffold formation, hence\nthe imperative to isolate, purify, and characterize the glycopro-\ntein itself. Thus, subsequent biochemical analysis of AtEXT3 and\nimaging by atomic force microscopy (AFM) presented here\nconfirmed its propensity for self-recognition and further poly-\nmerization. We propose that a positively charged extensin\nscaffold reacts with acidic pectin to form extensin pectate, which\nfurther templates orderly assembly of a nascent cell wall. This\nwork forces us to change the focus on extensin, from its role\nexclusively in the cessation of growth (16, 17) to an essential role\nin the initiation of growth.\nResults\nThe rsh Mutant Has Defective Cell Walls. At the electron microscope\nlevel, the plane of cell division in the embryo and abortive\nseedling was aberrant resulting in abnormally shaped cells with\nincomplete walls (Fig. 2), i.e., ‘‘floating walls,’’ which were\nunconnected to side walls, ‘‘hanging walls,’’ which were con-\nnected at one end only, and ‘‘wall stubs,’’ which were short wall\nprotrusions jutting from the mother cell wall. The newly forming\ncross wall frequently remained incomplete in the homozygous\nrsh mutant, apparently unable to connect or remain connected\nwith the mother cell wall at cytokinesis and unable to produce\nnormal walls in nondividing root cells.\nPurification of RSH and Its Identification as AtEXT3.

Thus, high salt rapidly desorbed weakly\nbound HRGPs from the walls of intact Arabidopsis cell cultures.\nThe major soluble component was consistent with the presence\nof lysine-rich positively charged extensin monomers. These basic\nmacromolecules interact via ion pairs or salt bridges with pectic\ncarboxylate groups (18), thus forming extensin pectate. Sizing by\nSuperose-6 gel filtration (Fig. 3A) and further purification by\ncation-exchange chromatography yielded a single fraction iden-\ntified as a monomeric extensin by its size, amino acid, and sugar\ncomposition. Subsequent alkaline hydrolysis yielded small Hyp-\narabinooligosaccharides (Table 1) characteristic of extensins\n(19) and consistent with the predictions of the Hyp contiguity\nhypothesis (20, 21). Deglycosylation of the mature glycoprotein\nin anhydrous hydrogen fluoride followed by sequencing gave the\nfirst 19 residues of the N terminus: NYFYSSOOOOVKHY-\nTOOVK (O \u0002 Hyp). This positively identified the glycoprotein\nas AtEXT3, a HRGP with strict periodicity of 11 identical\n28-residue peptide repeats, each with a YVY Idt cross-linking\nmotif. Tryptic degradation yielded two major peptide sequences\n[SOOOOVK and HYSOOOVY. . . ] predicted from the 28-\nresidue repeat motif, SPPPPKKHYVYKSPPPPVKHYSPP-\nPVYH, confirming the identity of the isolated glycoprotein as\nAtEXT3 and identical to RSH (5).\nRSH Forms Tyrosine Cross-Links in Vitro. Extensin peroxidase cat-\nalyzed cross-linking of purified extensin monomers (Fig. 3A) in\nvitro judging from rapid multimer formation assayed by gel\nfiltration (Fig. 3B). Increased reaction times beyond 5 min\nformed a gel that remained insoluble even after deglycosylation;\non acid hydrolysis this multimer yielded Idt and pulcherosine as\nmajor products with only a trace of di-Idt (Fig. 3D and Table 2).\nA perfect parallel alignment (Fig. 4A) of RSH Idt motifs would\nyield intermolecular di-Idt cross-links exclusively like the cross-\nlinking extensin analog (YK)20 described previously (14). How-\never, 28-residue RSH repeats offset by 12 residues align all RSH\ntyrosine residues as potential pulcherosine cross-link motifs (Idt\nwith a biphenyl link to lone Y residues of the HYS motif). Thus,\npulcherosine in cross-linked RSH indicates a staggered align-\nment of RSH monomers (Fig. 4B). The absence of pulcherosine\nfrom cross-linked (YK)20 (14) simply reflects the absence of\npulcherosine cross-link motifs from (YK)20. Unlike (YK)20 a\nstaggered lateral alignment of RSH would allow growth of the\npolymer scaffold in two dimensions both by linear and lateral\naddition of monomers as indicated by the following AFM data.\nA RSH Network Imaged by AFM.

This\nexperiment was designed to test the functionality of RSH when\nfused to GFP. RSH constructs with their C terminus (but not\ntheir N terminus) fused to GFP did not rescue the rsh/rsh mutant,\nand furthermore it impeded the function of native RSH in\nwild-type plants (Table 3). This suggests a special role for the C\nterminus in scaffold formation (see Discussion).\nDiscussion\nThe plant cell wall is a complex and diverse morphogenetic fabric\nassembled outside the plasma membrane from secreted macro-\nmolecular precursors. Currently the rules that govern their\nself-assembly at the molecular level are unknown. An approach\nusing mutagenesis to disrupt function led to the identification of\nthe recessive embryogenic rsh mutant associated with the knock-\nout of AtEXT3. The mutant had to be propagated as a hetero-\nzygote because the mutation is homozygous lethal. Earlier we\ntraced its defective morphology at the light microscope level to\nan aberrant initial division of the rsh/rsh zygote into a large apical\ncell and smaller basal cell rather than the small apical cell and\nlarger basal cell of the wild type (5). At the electron microscope\nlevel we observed defective wall assembly (Fig. 2). Because this\ncorresponded to a knockout of the AtEXT3 gene, we inferred\nabsence of AtEXT3, i.e., the RSH glycoprotein. We isolated\nRSH from the wild type and characterized it biochemically, thus\nidentifying it as AtEXT3. Because the cell plate of the wild type\ncontains RSH (5) and the mutant lacks RSH we conclude that\ndefective wall assembly is a direct consequence of RSH absence.\nRSH is therefore an essential cell wall component entirely\nconsistent with the original conclusion that ‘‘[p]rotein containing\nhydroxyproline is an integral part of the cell wall of actively\ngrowing cells” (7). Here we relate the molecular structure of\nRSH to its self-assembly as a putative molecular scaffold that\nmay template cell plate components in the new cross wall and\nenable its fusion with the mother cell wall.\nGolgi-derived vesicles transport precursors of the cell plate.\nThese vesicles fuse to form a membrane-bound nascent wall that\ngrows outwards from within the cell (23–25). Cell plate compo-\nnents include cellulose (26), xyloglucans, high levels of non-\nesterified polygalacturonic acid (27), arabinogalactan (28), cal-\nlose (28), arabinofuranose residues typical of extensin (28), and\nRSH, inferred from expression of RSH–GFP fusions (5); they\nwere all identified by immunocytology. Significantly, two Idt-rich\nextensins in Catharanthus showed cell cycle-regulated expres-\nsion, also suggesting that extensins provide material for cell plate\nformation (29). Thus, HRGP synthesis occurs at an early stage\nof wall assembly (30). The challenge is to describe how the\ncomponents of the disk-shaped cell plate undergo orderly self-\nassembly as it approaches and connects with the mother cell wall.\nDeposition of callose precedes that of cellulose, which is syn-\nthesized during maturation of the cell plate (26) in the final stage\nof cytokinesis; thus, callose may help in the formation and\nmechanical stabilization of the growing cell plate (26). Organi-\nzational or temporal data for other cell plate components are\nlargely unknown.\nExtensins are known as highly insoluble cell wall glycoproteins\nthat form Idt cross-links in vitro. Electron microscopy images of\nplatinum-shaded molecules indicate that these rod-shaped mol-\necules form both intramolecular and short oligo intermolecular\ncross-links (31). AFM data in this article (Fig. 5) showed that\nTable 2.

Small amounts of pulcherosine slowly appeared over time in batches of RSH stored frozen.\n†A 12-residue offset (Fig. 4B) with 100% cross-link formation involves all 60 Tyr residues as potential pulcherosine cross-links. The data here showed that\napproximately one-third were converted to covalent pulcherosine cross-links.\nA\nB\nFig. 4.\nAlignments of the RSH 28-aa repetitive motif.

Offsetting the 28-residue canonical RSH motif by 12 residues\nrealigns the Ser-Hyp4 glycomodule of one chain with another (underlined), thus switching from potential di-Idt to pulcherosine cross-links. Hydrophilic residues\nare shown in yellow, potential di-Idt and pulcherosine cross-links (hydrophobic) are in pink, and other hydrophobic residues are in gray. All motifs are presented\nin the N terminus (head) to C terminus (tail) direction.\n2228 \u0002\nwww.pnas.org\u0003cgi\u0003doi\u000310.1073\u0003pnas.0711980105\nCannon et al.\n\nsolutions of RSH extensin monomers generated both rope-like\nand dendritic structures via end-on adhesion and lateral\nassociation, consistent with the well known properties of self-\nassembling amphiphiles in general (32). Thus, RSH protonet-\nworks confirmed its scaffolding propensity. Unlike previously\npublished electron microscopy images, AFM images of RSH\nshowed that all of the available RSH molecules were incorpo-\nrated into multimeric structures. The extensive dendritic struc-\ntures observed by AFM could be a consequence of the different\ntechnology used compared with that of electron microscopy.\nSelf-assembly of extensin networks has been discussed for many\nyears. Here we outline an assembly paradigm that can be tested\nexperimentally and used for designing novel self-assembling\nsupramolecular structures.\nThe Extensin HRGP Self-Assembly Paradigm\nGeneral rules outlined more than a decade ago (20) identified\nHRGP putative functional sites involved in molecular alignment\nfor self-recognition and described how monomeric precursors\n(18) of high periodicity (33) could form extensin networks\nfurther stabilized by enzymic cross-linking (11). More recent\nwork identified the crucial role of tyrosine residues as intermo-\nlecular cross-links, namely pulcherosine (13) and di-Idt (34), but\nalso as hydrophobic recognition sites; thus, specific tyrosine\nresidues of collagen telopeptides may initiate self-assembly of\ncollagen (35). This may account for the apparent requirement\nfor an unobstructed tyrosine-rich RSH C terminus consistent\nwith its end-on adhesion (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Indeed, a\nC-terminal tyrosine residue is a notable feature in 18 of the 20\nArabidopsis extensins (SI Table 4).\nEarlier proposed features of self-assembling amphiphiles (32)\ntogether with the data presented here allow us to propose more\nspecific rules for the initial self-assembly of rod-like AtEXT3\namphiphiles into a positively charged scaffold that templates the\nin muro deposition of pectin. These rules apply to AtEXT3 and\nare supported by all of the available data, and they may apply to\nother extensins, given their highly homologous sequences within\n(SI Table 4) and between species; these rules involve hydropho-\nbic association, peptide periodicity, covalent cross-link forma-\ntion, and electrostatic recognition summarized as follows.\n1. A liquid–liquid interface favors self-assembly of highly or-\ndered amphiphilic arrays as flat sheets but not in free solution\n(32, 36).\nFig. 5.\nSelf-assembled RSH network imaged by AFM. (A) A solution of RSH monomer (9 \u0001g/ml water; see Fig. 3A) was dispersed on a highly ordered pyrolytic\ngraphite (HOPG) surface, and the molecular contours were imaged by AFM. The molecular height of the segments, which ranged from 0.6 nm to 5 nm, was\nestimated by the colors corresponding to the nanometer ruler on the right. The white bars represent 127-nm lengths and correspond to the calculated length\nof RSH, assuming a strict polyproline II helical secondary structure (three residues per turn; pitch \u0002 9.4 Å; 404 aa). The segments of the dendritic structure, here\naligned with the 127-nm rods (circled), likely correspond to a relatively few overlapping RSH molecules aligned to produce rigid segments slightly longer than\nthe RSH molecule, in keeping with its proposed staggered alignment.

Immature siliques and 3-day-old seedling\nroot pieces were ﬁxed for 2 h in primary ﬁxative (0.1 M pipes buffer, pH\n7.2/4.0% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde) followed by 2 h in second-\nary ﬁxative (0.1 M pipes buffer, pH 7.2/1% osmium tetroxide). Samples were\nwashed for 15 min sequentially in 0.1 M pipes buffer (pH 7.2) three times and\nwater twice, followed by dehydration, all at 4°C. After staining [2% uranyl\nacetate in 0.05 M malate (pH 6.0)] for 2 h, samples were inﬁltrated with resin\n(LR White, Medium Grade; London Resin) for 15 h and embedded under\nlong-wave UV light and a stream of nitrogen for a further 15 h, all at 4°C.\nSections (80 nm) transferred to formvar-coated nickel grids were examined\nwith a JOEL 100S transmission electron microscope at 80-kV acceleration.\nRescue of the rsh Mutant. The rsh mutant rescue experiments were done by\ntransforming heterozygous rsh plants (kanamycin-resistant) with the RSH\ngene fused to GFP, either at the C-terminal coding region of RSH precisely or\nat the N-terminal coding region of RSH at 5 aa downstream from the signal\npeptide cleavage site to ensure that a mature GFP–RSH fusion was produced.\nGreen ﬂuorescence in the cell wall in Tris buffer (pH 9.5) and its absence or\nsigniﬁcant reduction in protoplasts from transformed tissue conﬁrmed the\npresence of the GFP fusion proteins in the wall. All of the constructs included\nthe entire native RSH regulatory sequences on 6.3 kb of DNA in the EcoRI to\nXhoI sites of the binary vector SLJ75515 (conferring additional resistance to\nglufosinate-ammonium for plant selection) (40). The hypervirulent Agrobac-\nterium EHA105 strain (41) was used for plant transformation (42). After T1 seed\ncollection, individual glufosinate-ammonium-resistant T1 plants were se-\nlected [glufosinate-ammonium (Sigma 45520, 5 \u0001g per ml)/MS salts (Sigma\nM5524, 2.2 g/liter)/3% sucrose/0.8% agar), transferred to soil, and self-\nfertilized to yield T2 seed. Homozygous glufosinate-ammonium-resistant T2\nand T3 generation seedlings were scored as rsh homozygous (rsh/rsh), het-\nerozygous (RSH/rsh), or wild-type (RSH/RSH) transformants by germination on\nplates (as above) in the presence of kanamycin (40 \u0001g/ml). The rsh zygosity of\n30 independent transformants for each plasmid construct was examined.\nHomozygous rsh plants with a restored wild-type phenotype conﬁrmed\ncomplementation by the RSH transgene and its tagged fusions. RSH wild-type\nplants homozygous for the RSH transgene and its tagged fusions were also\nexamined.\nRSH Extensin Purification. After harvesting wild-type Arabidopsis cell cultures\nby ﬁltration (\u00017 days, 20% packed cell volume), the cell pad 200 mM AlCl3\neluate was dialyzed, sized on Superose-6, and then puriﬁed via reverse-phase\nchromatography on a Hamilton PRP-1 preparative column (14).\nAmino Acid Analysis. After acid hydrolysis of peptides and proteins in 6 M HCl\nat 105°C for 18 h and derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate, amino acids\nwere quantiﬁed as their phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives after gradient elu-\ntion on a C18 column as previously described (14).\nPeptide Sequencing. Peptide sequencing was performed by the Michigan State\nUniversity Macromolecular Facility (East Lansing, MI).\nSugar Analysis. After sample hydrolysis for 1 h at 121°C in 2 M triﬂuoroacetic\nacid, sugars were quantiﬁed as their alditol acetates via gas–liquid chroma-\ntography as previously described (14).\nHyp Glycoside Profiles. Hyp glycosides released by alkaline hydrolysis of RSH\nwere fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography on Chromobeads C\nand quantiﬁed by continuous automated assay of Hyp in the column eluate as\npreviously described (14).\nIn Vitro Cross-Linking via Extensin Peroxidase. One nanogram of the extensin\nperoxidase (pI 4.6) isolated from tomato was used in each mixture containing\n60 \u0001g of RSH plus 100 mM H2O2 in 300 \u0001l of 50 mM McIlvaine’s buffer, all as\npreviously described (11).\nAFM Visualization. A total of 60 \u0001l of aqueous protein solutions [9 \u0001g/ml RSH\n(monomeric fraction; see Fig. 3A), 10 \u0001g/ml BSA, 10 \u0001g/ml YK20, and 10 \u0001g/ml\npolyhydroxyproline (Sigma)] was deposited on graphite for 5 min; the water\nwas drawn off with ﬁlter paper, and the graphite surface was rinsed with 100\n\u0001l of water. The samples were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. AFM\nimages were obtained by using an MFP 3D microscope (Asylum Research) in AC\nmode under ambient conditions. Nanoprobes with a resonance frequency of\n\u000175 KHz and a spring constant of \u00013.5 N/m (NSC18; Mikromash) were used.\nThe quality factor of probe resonance was electronically enhanced, when\nnecessary, to ensure consistent imaging dynamics of the samples and their\ngraphite background (43).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes have\nnot been fully defined. Here we report that anti-VEGF therapy promotes local invasion and\nmetastasis by inducing collagen signaling in cancer cells. We show that chronic VEGF inhibition\nin a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)\ninduces hypoxia, a less differentiated mesenchymal-like tumor cell phenotype, TGFβ expression,\nand collagen deposition and signaling. Additionally, we show that collagen signaling is critical for\npro-tumorigenic activity of TGFβ in vitro. To further model the impact of collagen signaling in\ntumors, we evaluated PDA in mice lacking Sparc, a protein that reduces collagen binding to cell\nsurface receptors. Importantly, we show that loss of Sparc increases collagen signaling and tumor\nprogression. Together, these findings suggest that collagen actively promotes PDA spread and that\nenhanced disease progression associated with anti-VEGF therapy can arise from elevated ECM-\nmediated signaling.\nKeywords\npancreatic cancer; VEGF; Sparc; collagen; Peak1; epithelial to mesenchymal transition\nIntroduction\nTumor growth beyond a few millimeters in diameter requires the establishment of a tumor-\nassociated vasculature (1). This neovascularization is mediated by the activity of soluble\ngrowth factors, most notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), on existing\nendothelium (2).

Even more\nchallenging, patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with the anti-VEGF\nmonoclonal antibody bevacizumab had rapid tumor dissemination following a period of\nprimary tumor response (6). A similar effect was observed in preclinical models of GBM\nand pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNET) using the anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101\nand the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (7). These observations suggest\nthat anti-angiogenic therapy can, in some patients, promote tumor growth and spread.\nThe effect of anti-VEGF therapy on progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)\nhas not been studied in detail. PDA results in almost a quarter million deaths yearly\nworldwide. In the United States, approximately 90% of patients diagnosed with PDA\npresent with metastatic disease and have a median survival of less than one year (8).\nPreclinical studies have shown that anti-angiogenic therapy can suppress the growth of PDA\nxenografts and prolong the survival of mice bearing PDA tumors (9, 10). Yet in two separate\nphase III trials, patients with metastatic PDA failed to show any increase in overall survival\nwhen bevacizumab was added to the standard of care agent gemcitabine (CALGB 80303),\nor gemcitabine plus erlotinib (AViTA) (11, 12).\nTumors develop and progress in the context of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of\nseveral different cancer types, especially PDA, are robust and rich in fibrillar collagens,\nwhich have been proposed to be major barrier to chemoresponse (13, 14). Collagen\nsignaling facilitates TGFβ-mediated changes in tumor cell phenotype and can promote\ntumor cell survival and chemoresistance. This is particularly relevant to PDA, which is a\ndesmoplastic disease (13, 15). Each cell in the PDA microenvironment interacts with\nfibrillar collagen, which has the potential to impact cell signaling events via crosstalk of its\nreceptors with other signal cascades (15). Our goal was to study the biology of anti-VEGF\ntherapy in a robust preclinical model of PDA and determine if therapy induced hypoxia\ndrives changes in the ECM that contribute to the poor response of these tumors to therapy.\nWe assessed the effect of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, mcr84 (16), in a clinically\nrelevant genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDA. We found that mcr84\ninduced hypoxia, restrained tumor growth, and prolonged survival, yet tumors from mcr84-\ntreated mice exhibited a less differentiated phenotype and had increased metastatic burden.\nFurther, these tumors contained higher levels of fibrillar collagen and elevated collagen\nsignaling which includes activation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (Ddr1), protein tyrosine\nkinase 2 (Pyk2) and pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (Peak1). We also found that\nsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc) blocked collagen I from binding to Ddr1,\nand that PDA tumors grown in Sparc-/- mice (17, 18) exhibited increased collagen signaling\nand enhanced disease progression, similar to tumors from mice treated chronically with anti-\nVEGF therapy. Our findings support that collagen enhances PDA and that Sparc functions\nto limit collagen induced activation of Ddr1. Further these studies suggest that VEGF-\nblockade can promote tumorigenicity of PDA cells by promoting hypoxia-induced collagen\nproduction and stimulation of Ddr1.\nAguilera et al.\nPage 2\nCancer Res.

Following another round of washes with PBS, coverslips\nwere mounted with ProLong Gold with DAPI.\nHypoxia studies\nHypoxia studies with pimonidazole in vivo—Three mice per group were injected\nintravenously with 60 mg/kg of pimonidazole (30 mg/mL in 0.9% saline, Hypoxyprobe\nPlus;HPI Inc.) that was allowed to circulate for 90 minutes before sacrificing animals.\nFrozen tissue sections were interrogated with FITC-conjugated anti-pimonidazole primary\nantibody (Chemicon) and endothelial cell markers (CD31, Dianova; Meca-32, DSHB; or\nEndomucin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Eight images per tissue area were obtained and\nanalyzed using NIS Elements.\nHypoxia studies with hypoxic chamber in vitro—Cell lines were grown in 4-well\nchamber slides in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 1% O2 in a modular\nincubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberger) for 48 hr. For control conditions cells were\ncultivated in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 20% O2\n(normoxic conditions). Immunocytochemical analysis was conducted for the validation of\nHif1α induction.\nLiquid colony forming assay\nCell lines were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates at low density (250 cells per well) in 2\nml 5% DMEM. Cells were plated on respective culture conditions and allowed to sit for\n72-96 hours, or until significant colony formation. Cells were then fixed with 10% formalin\nand stained with crystal violet. Images were analyzed with Image J or NIS Elements.\nSircol collagen assay\nCell lines were prepared as indicated by the Sircol manual (Sircol Collagen Assay Kit,\nOubis Ltd). Sircol dye reagent is used to saturate the collagen in a sample. The principle of\nthe Sircol collagen assay is the binding of a dye to collagen. A collagen-dye complex forms\nand precipitates out, is recovered by centrifugation, eluted with alkali, and measured using a\nspectrophotometer at 555 nm. The intensity of color measurement is proportional to the\ncollagen concentration in a sample.\nWestern blot analysis\nSub-confluent monolayers of cells were lysed, supernatants were recovered by\ncentrifugation, protein concentrations were measured and equal amounts of total protein\nwere separated by SDSPAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA) followed by blockade in 5% milk in TBS-T. The membranes were incubated\novernight at 4°C with primary antibody. The membranes were then incubated with the\ncorresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz,\nCA). Specific bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL,\nPerkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) on autoradiographic film.\nCompetitive ELISA (Binding assay)\n96-well ELISA plates were coated with 10 μg/ml rat tail collagen I (BD Biosciences) or 2%\nCasein Acid Hydrolysate (Sigma) in PBS (Casein-PBS) and blocked with 2% Casein. For\ncompetitive binding assays, human recombinant DDR1-Fc (R&D Systems) and human\nrecombinant SPARC (R&D Systems) were added to the wells at respective concentrations in\ntriplicate in ELISA Binding Buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Binding of DDR1 or\nSPARC was detected with primary and secondary antibodies for human DDR1 (R&D\nSystems) or human SPARC (R&D Systems) in 2% Casein-PBS. 50 μl TMB One\nAguilera et al.\nPage 4\nCancer Res.

All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad\nSoftware Inc.). Datasets were analyzed by Student t test or ANOVA followed by Dunn\nposttest or Tukey’s MCT and results were considered as significant at p < 0.05. Results are\nshown as mean ± SEM.\nResults\nAngiogenic stress and elevated VEGF in murine PDA model\nHuman PDAs frequently contain an activating mutation in the oncogene KRAS, and an\ninactivating mutation in the tumor suppressor CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF) (22, 23). Mice that\nharbor analogous genetic alterations specifically in the pancreas (LSL-KrasG12D;\nCdkn2alox/lox; p48Cre, abbreviated here as KIC) develop aggressive, invasive pancreatic\ntumors (19, 24). Histological analysis of pancreatic tissue harvested from KIC animals\nrevealed that these mice develop PanIN lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma by the\ntime the mice are 4-8 weeks old (Supplementary Figure 1A). Alcian blue-PAS staining of\nmucin containing ducts showed the loss of normal ductal architecture and function during\nthe progression of PDA in KIC mice (Supplementary Figure 1A) while picrosirius red and\ntrichrome analysis revealed that KIC tumors have more collagen that WT pancreata\n(Supplementary Figure 1A-1B).\nWe evaluated vascular parameters in normal pancreatic and PDA tissue at various time\npoints (Figure 1). NG2+ pericytes were localized to endomucin expressing endothelial cells\nin normal pancreatic tissue and in pancreatic tissue harvested from 4 and 7 week old KIC\nmice (Figure 1A). We found that microvessel density was significantly lower in PDA tissue\nthan normal pancreas (Figure 1B). However, endothelial cells in the tumors were\nproliferative (Figure 1C) and displayed an angiogenic phenotype, typified by the presence of\nsprouts, which were not present in the vasculature of normal pancreas (Figure 1D). We also\nobserved that the expression level of VEGF was higher in PDA tissue than normal\npancreatic tissue (Figure 1E).\nVEGF-blockade prolongs PDA survival and increases hypoxia, TGFβ activity, and collagen\ndeposition\nTo determine the contribution of VEGF to PDA progression, KIC mice (4 weeks old) were\ntreated with saline, mouse chimeric r84 (mcr84), or mcr84 plus gemcitabine (Gem) (Figure\n2A-2H, Table 1). mcr84 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds VEGF and\ninhibits VEGF stimulation of VEGFR2 (16). Four weeks of therapy with mcr84 or mcr84\nplus Gem reduced tumor burden as assessed by amylase expression (Figure 2A-2B) and total\npancreas weight (Figure 2C). Anti-VEGF therapy alone reduced primary tumor weight by\n36% (p<0.05 vs saline), while mcr84 plus Gem reduced tumor weight by 65% (p<0.0001 vs\nsaline) (Figure 2C). To determine whether anti-VEGF +/- chemotherapy improved animal\nsurvival, KIC mice were treated with saline (n=27), mcr84 (n=15), or mcr84 + Gem (n=15)\nstarting at the age of 4 weeks. Therapy was maintained until animals were moribund (Table\n1). The median survival of each treatment cohort was determined. Mice that received saline\nhad a median survival of 56 days, while treatment with mcr84 or the combination extended\nmedian survival to 56 and 82 days, respectively (Figure 2D). However, at the time of\nsacrifice liver metastatic burden was higher in in mice receiving mcr84. The extent of liver\nAguilera et al.\nPage 5\nCancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 15.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nmetastasis was determined by quantitative PCR for the recombined Cdkn2a allele (Figure\n2E, Supplementary Figure 2A) and histological evaluation of macrometastases\n(Supplementary Figure 2B). The incidence of metastasis calculated by histology was 35, 63,\nand 46% in saline (n=14), mcr84 (n=11) and mcr84 + Gem (n=13) groups, respectively.\nThe observation that anti-VEGF therapy did not reduce metastatic burden is similar to prior\nstudies (7, 25), which reported that anti-VEGF therapy drove phenotypic changes in tumor\ncells consistent with a loss of differentiation. To examine if these changes were present in\nKIC tumors after treatment with mcr84, we evaluated histology (H&E and trichrome) of the\nprimary tumors and expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Tumors harvested\nfrom mice in the survival study treated with mcr84 alone or in combination with Gem\ndisplayed a loss of differentiation by histology (Figure 2F) and a dramatic increase in\nMasson’s trichrome stain, an indicator of collagen deposition (Figure 2G, Supplementary\nFigure 3A). Consistent with the histological changes, expression of E-cadherin, a typical\nmarker of epithelial cells, was reduced while expression of the mesenchymal markers, zeb1\nand vimentin, were elevated in tumors from mice treated with mcr84 alone or in\ncombination with Gem (Figure 2H).\nTherapy-induced hypoxia is a predicted outcome of VEGF blockade and has been reported\nto drive an aggressive tumor phenotype (7, 25, 26). To validate the general mechanism of\nmcr84, microvessel density and the level of hypoxia were determined. mcr84 alone or in\ncombination with Gem significantly reduced tumor microvessel density (Figure 3A). This\nwas coupled with an elevation in hypoxia as measured by companion studies using\npimonidazole (Figure 3B). Concordant with the induction of hypoxia, the expression of\ncollagen I, Hif1α, and hexokinase II were elevated in tumors from mice treated with mcr84\nor mcr84 plus Gem (Supplementary Figure 3B). Furthermore, Tgfβ2, a hypoxia-responsive\ncytokine (27) that stimulates collagen expression and deposition (28) was elevated\nsignificantly following mcr84 therapy (Figure 3C). These results suggest that anti-VEGF\ntherapy induces hypoxia, which in turn drives Tgfβ-stimulated activity including collagen\ndeposition and EMT. To model this in vitro, primary murine KIC PDA cells were plated on\ncollagen and treated with Tgfβ under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that\nhypoxia stimulated soluble collagen secretion by PDA cells and primary NG2+ stromal cells\n(Supplementary Figure 3C-3D). Similar to the in vivo observations, in vitro stimulation with\nTgfβ drove morphological changes consistent with a loss of differentiation and promoted\nloss of E-cadherin, gain of vimentin expression and protection from hypoxia-induced\napoptosis (Figure 3D-3E). To determine if collagen was critical to the effect of Tgfβ, cells\nwere plated on plastic or collagen and stimulated with Tgfβ. Tgfβ treatment in the absence of\ncollagen resulted in induction of apoptosis but limited change in expression of E-cadherin or\nvimentin. In contrast cells plated on collagen and treated with Tgfβ underwent EMT and\nwere protected from Tgfβ-induced apoptosis (Figure 3F-3G).\nTo evaluate the contribution of Tgfβ to the tumor cell changes in vivo, we treated KIC mice\nwith 1D11, a mAb that binds and inhibits each isoform of mouse Tgfβ (21). KIC mice were\ntreated with saline (n=4), mcr84+Gem (n=5), 1D11 (n=7), 1D11+mcr84 (n=7), or the triple\ncombination (n=8) for 4 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age (Table 1). 1D11 did not reduce\nprimary tumor growth and abrogated the survival benefit of mcr84+Gem (Supplementary\nFigure 4A). However, blockade of Tgfβ with 1D11 reduced liver metastatic events more\nthan treatment with mcr84 and dramatically curtailed mcr84-induced collagen deposition\n(Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 4B-4C).\nTo determine if Tgfβ blockade affected collagen signaling we analyzed the activation status\nof the collagen receptor Ddr1 and signaling intermediates (Pyk2 and Src) thought to function\ndownstream of this receptor (29). Tumors from mice treated with mcr84 plus Gem had\nAguilera et al.\nPage 6\nCancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 15.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nelevated levels of phosphorylated Ddr1, Pyk2 and Src. Treatment with 1D11 significantly\nreduced the level of each phosphorylated target (Figure 4B-4D). We also evaluated the level\nof active pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase I (Peak1), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase\npreviously linked to Src activity and ECM signaling (30, 31). Phosphorylated Peak1 levels\nwere also elevated in tumors from mice treated with mcr84 plus Gem but reduced to\nbaseline levels by Tgfβ blockade (Figure 4E). In addition, the mesenchymal marker\nvimentin was elevated by mcr84 in combination with Gem and this was reduced by Tgfβ\nblockade (Figure 4F). These results suggest that collagen levels and collagen mediated\nsignaling increase in PDA tumors treated with anti-VEGF therapy and that blockade of\ncollagen deposition via Tgfβ inhibition decrease collagen mediated signaling.\nSparc inhibits collagen-Ddr1 interaction\nDue to the challenges of interpreting the effect of loss of collagen signaling in the context of\nTgfβ inhibition (32) we sought to model enhanced collagen signaling in PDA using mice\ndeficient in secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc). Structural studies indicate\nthat SPARC and the DDRs bind to the same epitope (GVMGFO) on fibrillar collagens (33,\n34). To determine if SPARC interferes with collagen binding to DDR1 we evaluated the\neffect of recombinant human SPARC on the binding of human DDR1/Fc to immobilized\ncollagen I in an ELISA-type assay. SPARC reduced DDR1 binding to collagen in a\nconcentration-dependent manner (Figure 5A). To assess the effect of Sparc in vivo we\ncrossed Sparc-/- animals with KIC mice. The absence of endogenous Sparc resulted in\nreduced survival and increased primary tumor size (Figure 5B-5C, Supplementary Figure\n5A). Additionally, tumors in Sparc-/- mice were less differentiated as determined by reduced\nmucin expression by Alcian blue-PAS histology (Figure 5D). The increase in progression in\nthe absence of Sparc correlated with a greater activation of Ddr1 and increased staining of\nmesenchymal marker (vimentin). This suggests the elevation of collagen signaling is due to\nincreased collagen binding to the surface of tumor cells in Sparc-/- KIC model (Figure\n5E-5J). Consistent with this, the activation of Ddr1, Src, Pyk2, and Peak1 was elevated in\ntumors from Sparc-/- animals (Figure 5E-5H), while the level of total Peak1 was not\ndifferent between tumors in Sparc+/+ and Sparc-/- mice (Figure 5I). Additionally, vimentin\nlevels were elevated in tumors from Sparc-/- mice (Figure 5J).\nIncreased collagen deposition and signaling drives DDR-mediated PDA progression\nTo investigate how Sparc interferes with collagen-stimulated Ddr1 signaling, primary cell\nlines developed from Sparc+/+ and Sparc-/- KIC tumors were plated on fibronectin and\nstimulated with soluble collagen (Figure 6). These PDA cells differentially express collagen\nreceptors, Sparc, and collagen (Supplementary Figure 5B-5C). Maximal activation of Ddrs\noccurs after 4 hours (35). We found that a 4 hour stimulation with collagen resulted in robust\nactivation of Ddr1, Pyk2, Src, and Peak1 (Figure 6A). Furthermore, Peak1 activation\nappears to be more potently induced by collagen I rather than collagen IV (35) (Figure 6B)\nand collagen induced Peak1 activation was elevated in cells that lack Sparc (Figure 6C;\nSupplementary Figure 5C, 6A). We also found that activation of Peak1 by collagen was\nsensitive to Ddr1 blockade by an anti-DDR1 antibody (36) or recombinant human SPARC\n(Figure 6D, Supplementary Figure 6B). Ddr1 blockade had functional consequences as it\nreduced collagen-supported colony forming capabilities of primary PDA cell lines (Figure\n6E), as well as migration in the presence of Ddr1 inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 6B).\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this project was to assess the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on PDA and\ndetermine if changes in ECM contribute to tumor response to therapy. We found that the\nanti-VEGF mAb mcr84 reduced microvessel density, induced hypoxia, restrained tumor\nAguilera et al.\nPage 7\nCancer Res.

We observed that VEGF inhibition increased Tgfβ-\ndependent collagen deposition and collagen I mediated signaling through Ddr1.\nFurthermore, we provide evidence that the recently identified kinase Peak1 is a signaling\nintermediate downstream of Ddr1 and that the matricellular protein Sparc reduces collagen I\nsignaling through Ddr1. These findings highlight that collagen signaling through Ddr1 is a\ncritical feature in the response of PDA to therapy and are summarized in Figure 6F.\nNumerous reports (7, 26, 37-40) have identified increased tumor aggressiveness in murine\nmodels of cancer after anti-angiogenic therapy. In each of these studies, therapy induced\nhypoxia is a central mechanistic feature of the resulting tumor phenotype. Hypoxia-driven\nexpression and/or activation of specific signaling cascades (e.g., c-Met, Axl, CTGF),\nrecruitment of tumor promoting immune cells or induction of cell survival pathways\nincluding autophagy are supported by these and other reports (41-43). Our study is the first\nto show that hypoxia-induced driven changes in the ECM contribute to the aggressiveness of\ntumors post anti-VEGF therapy. Importantly, therapies that drive hypoxia do not always\nincrease epithelial plasticity and tumor aggressiveness. For example, we have found that\nsome anti-angiogenic strategies, including PG545, a heparanase inhibitor and BIBF1120, a\nmulti-angiokinase inhibitor, potently increase hypoxia but do not increase epithelial\nplasticity or metastasis in pancreatic tumors in mice (20, 44). Interestingly, neither strategy\nincreased collagen deposition.\nOur studies relied on the use of the KIC model of PDA. One of the notable features of the\nKIC model is that the tumors often exhibit histologic features (sarcomatoid change) that are\nassociated with aggressive clinical behavior in human cancers. Concordantly, PDAs arise in\nthe KIC model with short latency, are desmoplastic and lethal (19, 24, 32). Tumors are first\ndetected at 3-4 weeks of age and deaths from cancer occur by 8-10 weeks. These features\nmake the KIC model particularly well-suited for endpoint and survival studies, which can be\nperformed more rapidly and efficiently in this model than in other PDA GEMMs.\nFurthermore, human PDA displays a spectrum of histologies and response characteristics\nthat mirror those of the KIC GEMM. Additionally, this model incorporates the two most\ncommon genetic lesions present in human PDA tumors (e.g., KRAS activation and INK4a\nloss).\nWe attempted to evaluate the contribution of Tgfβ to PDA progression in the context of anti-\nVEGF therapy. Our studies show that Tgfβ is a major driver of collagen deposition;\nhowever, Tgfβ has pleiotropic effects which include tumor suppression even in established\nKIC tumors. Thus blockade of Tgfβ increased tumor progression and reduced animal\nsurvival, results that are consistent with Hezel et al (32). Importantly, we found that Tgfβ\nblockade resulted in a reduction in metastatic burden in the liver as assessed by qPCR. We\npropose that inhibition of Ddr1 might be a functional alternative to direct Tgfβ inhibition. In\nsupport of this, we identified that collagen I signaling enhanced the tumorigenic properties\nof Tgfβ in vitro. Additionally, collagen signaling was reduced when Tgfβ was neutralized\nbut was increased when Sparc was removed from the tumor microenvironment.\nSparc participates in the orchestration of collagen deposition but a unifying principle of\nSparc function in the tumor microenvironment is lacking (45). Sparc is produced by multiple\ncell types (45), including stromal and tumor cells, though tumor cells often lose SPARC\nexpression via hypermethylation (46, 47) and this correlates directly with poor\nchemoresponse (48). We found that Sparc blocked collagen I from binding to Ddr1, and that\nPDA tumors grown in Sparc-/- mice exhibited increased collagen signaling and enhanced\ndisease progression. This is supported by the following observations: a) the amino acids that\ncomprise the Sparc binding region on fibrillar collagens is the same sequence recognized by\nAguilera et al.\nPage 8\nCancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 15.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nDdr1 (34, 49); b) collagen is associated preferentially with cell surfaces instead of being\ndeposited into the ECM in the absence of Sparc (50); c) Tgfβ-induced EMT is potentiated by\ncollagen interaction with the cell surface (29); d) loss of Sparc expression by tumor cells\ncorrelates with the switch of Tgfβ from a suppressor to a promoter of PDA (46, 47); and e)\npancreatic tumor cells are more aggressive in preclinical models of PDA in the absence of\nSparc (51, 52). Further, these results are consistent with reports that collagen is associated\nwith cellular processes that are prominent in PDA, including EMT and chemoresistance (13,\n29). Activation of Ddr signaling is likely context dependent and may preferentially affect the\ncell that produces the collagen. Multiple cell types, including tumor cells, secrete collagen I\nin the tumor microenvironment. It is plausible that this collagen provides autocrine\nstimulation, especially in the absence of Sparc (50). In aggregate these studies suggest that\ninhibition of collagen signaling through the DDRs will enhance therapeutic response in\nPDA. Furthermore, SPARC inhibition of DDR activation by collagen provides a potential\nexplanation for the observations that SPARC expression correlates with chemoresponse in\nPDA patients (48).\nHow Ddr1 promotes tumor progression is unclear; although we identified that collagen\nstimulated Ddr1 activation induces signaling through Pyk2 and Peak1. Peak1, a recently\ndescribed kinase, has been implicated in invasion and tumor progression in colon and PDA\nxenografts (30). Inhibition of Peak1 or Ddr1 activity is an attractive strategy to potentially\nreduce collagen signaling in tumors. No Peak1 selective inhibitors have been described\nhowever the number of DDR selective small molecular inhibitors is increasing (53, 54).\nSome of these inhibitors including 3-(2-(Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)-ethynyl) benzamide\n7rh (7-4104) (53) have shown potent inhibition of colony formation and anchorage\nindependent growth in tumor cells in vitro and favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic\ncharacteristics (53).\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate that collagen signaling enhances PDA, and suggest\nthat VEGF-blockade can promote tumorigenicity of a subset of PDA cells by promoting\nhypoxia-induced collagen production and stimulation of Ddr1.\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge Jordan Braunfeld for technical assistance and members of the Brekken laboratory for\nhelpful comments on the manuscript, as well as Richard Howdy at Visually Medical for preparation of the pathway\nfigure.

In this work, we describe the\nimproved synthesis, photophysical properties and applications of pH sensors based on amine-reactive\npHrodo esters and short-chain lipid derivatives of phosphoethanolamine. The major features of these novel\nprobes include strong ﬂuorescence under acidic conditions, eﬃcient partitioning into membranes, and\nextractability by back exchange to albumin. These features allow for the selective labeling of the inner lipo-\nsomal leaﬂet in reconstituted membrane systems for studying proton pumping activities in a quantitative\nfashion, as demonstrated by assaying the activity of a plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Furthermore, the\nshort-chain lipid-conjugated pH sensors enable the monitoring of pH changes from neutral to acidic con-\nditions in the endocytic pathway of living cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate the applicability of\nshort-chain lipid-conjugated sensors for in vivo and in vitro studies and thus pave the way for the design of\nlipid-conjugated sensors selective to other biologically relevant ions, e.g. calcium and sodium.\nIntroduction\nProton (H+) gradients across biomembranes are fundamental\nto cells. In eukaryotic cells, these gradients are generated and\nmaintained by ATP-fuelled, membrane-embedded transpor-\nters. Vacuolar H+-ATPases (or V-ATPases) function to acidify\nintracellular\ncompartments,\nincluding\nvacuoles/lysosomes,\nendosomes, and the Golgi apparatus.1,2 These intracellular\npumps act in concert with H+ exporters at the plasma mem-\nbrane. In plants and fungi, P-type H+-ATPases are responsible\nfor direct export of protons, while in mammals, P-type Na+,K+-\nATPases drive the activity of Na+/H+-exchangers to achieve H+\nexport at the plasma membrane.3–5 The established pH gradi-\nents are often used in coupled transport to drive the uptake or\nexport of other solutes. Examples of such coupled transporters\ninclude H+-dependent co-transporters responsible for the cel-\nlular uptake of e.g. sugars, amino acids, neurotransmitters or\nbile acids. Dysfunction of these transport systems either\nresults in or aggravates various diseases.5–7 Given the pivotal\nrole of these transporters in cell homeostasis and health, a\nthorough understanding of their organization, functioning\nand dynamics is highly desirable and would help in identify-\ning and selecting drugs that target H+ pumps.\nTo investigate the transport activity of H+ translocating pro-\nteins in well-defined reconstituted membrane systems and\nintact cells, fluorescent compounds based on synthetic small\nmolecules represent a powerful tool. Although a variety of pH-\nsensitive probes exist, many have limitations in studies with\n†Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: TLC analysis of DOPE-\nconjugated pHrodo Green and Red (Fig. S1); analytical characterization of the\nlipid-conjugated sensors by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. S2); pH sensitivity of\nshort-chain lipid-conjugated fluorescent pH indicators (Fig. S3); stable inner\nmembrane localization of the lipid-conjugated pH sensors (Fig. S4); conversion\nof fluorescence intensity into pH (Fig. S5); cell surface staining with C16C6-PE-\npHrodo Red (Fig. S6); fluorescence of C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red-labelled cells in\nresponse to NH4Cl (Fig. S7); eﬀect of the prolonged incubation on pHrodo Green\ndextran and lipid-conjugated pHrodo Red cellular fluorescence (Fig. S8); pH\ntitration in cells loaded with C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red (Fig. S9); stability and cyto-\ntoxicity of C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red (Fig. S10).

For example, water-soluble dyes such\nas\npyranine\n(8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulphonic\nacid)\nand\nfluorescamine have been used to monitor the intravesicular\npH values in mechanistic studies of H+-translocating mem-\nbrane-bound proteins.8–11 However, their modest brightness\n(pyranine) and high bleaching rates (fluorescamine) make\nthem diﬃcult to use for pH measurements in vivo and in vitro.\nA number of alternative water-soluble pH-sensitive dyes with\nimproved brightness and photostability are available, such as\nrhodamine-based dyes. However, problems with insuﬃcient\nencapsulation during protein reconstitution and leakage out\nof vesicles were reported.12,13 More recently, lipid-conjugated\npH sensors based on fluorophores coupled to long-chain\nlipids have been utilized.14–17 These lipid-conjugated pH\nsensors eﬃciently co-reconstitute with membrane proteins\ninto large liposomes, thereby avoiding their loss during recon-\nstitution and allowing studies in reconstituted systems down\nto the single vesicle level.15,16 Unfortunately, their low water-\nsolubility excludes leaflet-selective labelling during protein\nreconstitution and application on intact cells (Fig. 1). In recon-\nstitution approaches, exclusive labelling of the inner vesicle\nleaflet would circumvent the problem of background fluo-\nrescence from outer leaflet fluorophores and thus result in\nbetter signal-to-noise ratios, leading to more reliable detection\nof ion transport. Furthermore, the eﬀects of the external solu-\ntion on the fluorescence of outer leaflet fluorophores are elimi-\nnated.14 At the same time, sensor calibration and data analysis\nare simplified as only the signal of inner leaflet fluorophores\nneeds to be considered. The concept of leaflet-specific label-\nling is not only relevant for pH-sensitive fluorophores, e.g.\nOregon Green 488,16 but also for fluorophores selective for\nother ions including K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+.\nHere, we report on an improved synthesis of lipid-conju-\ngated pH sensors from amine-reactive pHrodo esters and\nderivatives of phosphoethanolamine containing diﬀerent acyl\nchain lengths. We demonstrate that such pH sensors eﬃciently\nincorporate into membranes, but in contrast to long-chain\nderivatives, short-chain lipid-conjugated sensors can be back\nextracted with albumin. These features allow for the selective\nlabelling of the inner liposomal leaflet in reconstituted mem-\nbrane systems for studying H+ pumping activities in a quanti-\ntative fashion, as demonstrated by assaying the activity of a\nplant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Furthermore, the novel\nshort-chain lipid-conjugated pH sensors enable the monitoring\nof pH changes from neutral to acidic conditions in living cells.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nThe lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC),\n1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine\n(DOPE),\n1,2-\ndihexanoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine\n(diC6-PE),\n1,2-\ndioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine\n(diC8-PE)\nand\n1-hexadecanoyl-2-hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine\n(C16C6-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,\nAL, USA). Reactive pH-sensor esters of pHrodo (pHrodo™Red,\nsuccinimidyl ester and pHrodo™Green, sulfotetrafluorophe-\nnyl ester) and water-soluble pHrodo™Green Dextran (10 000\nMW) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Dreieich,\nGermany). The detergent n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) was\nobtained from Glycon Biochemicals (Luckenwalde, Germany).\nBio-beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were\nwashed with methanol and rinsed with double-distilled water\nbefore use.

Preformed liposomes (step I) prepared with trace\namounts of lipid-linked sensors are detergent-destabilized and mixed\nwith the detergent-puriﬁed transporter. Subsequent removal of the\ndetergent results in the formation of sealed proteoliposomes with\nsensors at the outer and inner liposomal leaﬂets (step II). For most avail-\nable ﬂuorophores, this setup can compromise the analysis of ion trans-\nporters due to background ﬂuorescence from outer leaﬂet ﬂuorophores.\nThis problem is solved by the use of short-chain lipid-linked sensors that\ncan be back extracted with albumin from the outer vesicle leaﬂet\n(step III).\nTable 1\nReaction conditions for the conjugation of pH-sensor esters to\nphosphatidylethanolamine lipids\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nSolvent\nMethanol\n(water-free)\nDMSO\n(water-free)\nDMF\nDCM/DMF\n(6/1, v/v)\nBase\n(final\nconc.)\nTriethylamine\n(40 mM)\nNMM\n(450 mM)\nNMM\n(450 mM)\nDIPEA\n(130 mM)\nAbbreviations:\nDCM,\ndichloromethane;\nDIPEA,\nN,N-\ndiisopropylethylamine;\nDMSO,\ndimethylsulfoxide;\nDMF,\ndimethylformamide; NMM, N-methylmorpholine.\nAnalyst\nPaper\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nAnalyst, 2019, 144, 3030–3037 | 3031\nPublished on 11 March 2019.

Afterwards, lipids were extracted from the reaction solu-\ntion according to Bligh and Dyer.18 R2 lipid extracts were sub-\njected to dichloromethane–water partition in a 1 : 1 ratio (v : v)\nto remove residual dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Subsequently,\nall organic extracts were applied onto normal phase silica gel\nthin layer chromatography plates (TLC, silica gel 60, Merck)\nand developed with a mixture of chloroform/ethanol/water/tri-\nethylamine (30/35/7/35, v/v/v/v). The band containing the\nproduct was scraped oﬀand extracted using a mixture of\nchloroform, methanol, and water (1/2.2/1, v/v/v). This extract\nwas further purified on a second TLC plate which was devel-\noped with a mixture of 50/20/10/10/2.5 (v/v/v/v/v) chloroform,\nacetone, methanol, glacial acetic acid, and water. The band\ncontaining the product was scraped oﬀand extracted as\ndescribed\nabove.\nTLC\nplates\nwere\nphotographed\nunder\nambient light or 365 nm UV light. To visualise non-reacted\nphosphatidylethanolamine,\nTLC\nplates\nwere\nsubsequently\nstained with primuline (0.005% in acetone/water 8/2; v/v)19\nand photographed under 365 nm UV light. Product bands\nwere identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as pre-\nviously described;14 the yields were determined by phosphate\nestimation according to Rouser et al.20\nLiposome preparation\nLiposomes were prepared by manual extrusion. Briefly, chloro-\nform stocks of DOPC (10 mg, ∼12.7 µmol) and 20 nmol\n(0.16 mol%) lipid-conjugated pH sensors were dispensed into\na round bottom glass tube, mixed and dried under a stream of\nnitrogen at room temperature. The lipid film was rehydrated\nin 667 µl of reconstitution buﬀer (10 mM Mes-KOH, pH 7,\n50 mM K2SO4, 20% glycerol) by vortexing in the presence of a\n3 mm glass pearl, and passed 41 times through 0.2 µm size\nnucleopore\npolycarbonate\nmembranes\n(Nuclepore™,\nWhatman GmbH, Germany) mounted in a mini-extruder\n(Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The resulting liposomes\nwere kept at 4 °C and used within 1 week or flash frozen in\nliquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.\npH titration of lipid-conjugated pH sensors\nFor assessment of the pH dependence of lipid-conjugated pH\nsensors, a range of diﬀerent buﬀers between pH 2.5 and 10.7\nwere prepared. Each buﬀer component was prepared as 20 mM\nstock supplemented with 52.5 mM K2SO4 and the individual\nbuﬀer components were mixed to obtain the required pH\nvalues. Citrate/phosphate buﬀer was used for pH 2.5–7, phos-\nphate buﬀer for pH 7–8, and carbonate/bicarbonate buﬀer for\npH 9–10.7. Prior to fluorescence measurements, liposomes\ncontaining the lipid-conjugated pH sensors were diluted\n1 : 200 in the respective pH buﬀers supplemented with the K+\nionophore valinomycin (62.5 nM) and the protonophore carbo-\nnyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 5 µM) for at least\n15 min to allow equilibration of pH values between the inside\nand the outside of the liposomes. The presence of the K+ iono-\nphore valinomycin and high concentrations of K+ inside and\noutside the vesicles prevent the buildup of a membrane\nvoltage diﬀerence. Fluorescence emission was recorded at\n25 °C with a fluorometer (PTI-Quantamaster 800, Horiba,\nBenzheim,\nGermany),\nusing\nan\nexcitation\nwavelength\nof\n532\nnm\nfor\npHrodo\nRed\nlipids\n(emission\nscan\nrange\n550–700 nm) and 495 nm for pHrodo Green-DOPE (emission\nscan range 515–665 nm). Intensity maxima from the obtained\nspectra were each normalized to the maximum value, plotted\nwith the respective pH values and fitted using a global non-\nlinear least square fit to the Boltzmann function (Origin Pro\n2017G, OriginLab, Northampton, MA).\nPreparation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2)\nA 73 amino acid C-terminal truncated version of AHA2, con-\ntaining a hexahistidine (6 × His) and a SNAP® tag at the\nN-terminal end of the protein, was overexpressed in the\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS-72 and purified according to\npreviously published protocols.21 The cells were lysed by vor-\ntexing with glass beads, and the protein was solubilised and\npurified with DDM at a ratio of 3 : 1 detergent : protein (wt/wt)\nusing batch-binding to a Ni2+-NTA resin. The purified protein\nwas finally concentrated to 5–10 mg mL−1 using centrifugal\nconcentrators with a cut-oﬀat 30 kDa (Vivaspin 20, GE\nHealthcare), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in\nstorage buﬀer containing 50 mM Mes-KOH (pH 7), 50 mM\nKCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol until further use.\nVesicle reconstitution and analysis\nPurified H+-ATPase was reconstituted into preformed lipo-\nsomes as previously described,21 using 75 µg purified protein\nper 220 µl reconstitution buﬀer containing 50 mM octyl β-D-\nglucopyranoside (OG) and liposomes (3 µmol of lipid; protein-\nto-lipid molar ratio ∼1 : 4800). The solubilised protein/lipid/\ndetergent mixture was subjected to gel filtration (Sephadex\nG-50 Fine, 2 ml packed in 2 ml disposable syringes) by cen-\ntrifugation (180g, 8 min). The eluate was incubated for 30 min\nat room temperature with 100 mg of wet Bio-Beads under over-\nhead rotation to eliminate traces of the detergent. Protein-free\nliposomes\nwere\nprepared\nsimilarly\nby\nreplacing\npurified\nprotein with reconstitution buﬀer. Phospholipid vesicle recov-\nery was determined by measuring the amount of phospholipid\nphosphorus throughout the procedure.20 The concentrations\nof lipid-conjugated pH sensors before and after reconstitution\nwere\nquantified\nfluorimetrically\n(vide\nsupra);\ncomparison\nbetween these two values yielded the sensor recovery.\nExtraction of lipid-conjugated pH sensors from vesicles\nTo extract lipid-conjugated pH sensors from the outer vesicle\nleaflet, liposomes or proteoliposomes (2.9 µmol lipid) were\nincubated in a total volume of 500 µL with 10% (wt/v) defatted\nbovine serum albumin overnight in floating buﬀer (10 mM\nMes-KOH, pH 7, 50 mM K2SO4) at 4 °C.

The cells were plated in 35 mm dishes at a\ndensity of 2 × 104 cells per mL and allowed to adhere for 24 h.\nBefore the experiments, the cells were washed twice with ice-\ncold HEPES-BSS buﬀer. For labelling diC6-, diC8-, and C16C6-\nPE-pHrodo lipids (dissolved in methanol) were transferred to a\nglass tube, dried under nitrogen, and subsequently solubilized\nin absolute ethanol (5 nmol per Petri dish). The ethanolic solu-\ntion was added (2% of the final volume) to HEPES-BSS contain-\ning 5 µM defatted albumin for a final lipid concentration of\n10 μM. Cells were incubated with label suspension (1 ml per\ndish) for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, non-inserted pH sensors\nwere removed by three washes with ice-cold HEPES-BSS prior to\nimaging in HEPES-BSS or MES-BSS. Optionally, cells were\nwarmed for 30 min to 37 °C by adding pre-warmed HEPES-BSS.\nWhen indicated, HEPES-BSS contained 10 µM pHrodo Green\nDextran. For extraction of C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red from the cell\nsurface, cells were incubated twice with 10% (wt/v) albumin in\nHEPES-BSS for 15 min on ice.\nCalibration curves were generated by imaging cells with the\ninternalized sensor in a 20 mM citric acid/phosphate buﬀer\nadjusted to various pH values and supplemented with 10 µM\nnigericin/valinomycin, 10 mM glucose, 50 mM N-methyl-D-glu-\ncamin and 140 mM KCl.\nThe cytotoxicity of C16C6-PE-pHrodo-Red was evaluated\nusing a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium\nbromide (MTT) assay.

The lipid-\nconjugated pHrodo Green and pHrodo Red derivatives dis-\nplayed strongly pH-dependent fluorescence with an emission\npeak at 543 nm and 588 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 and ESI\nFig. S3†). Analysis of the titration experiments revealed that\nthe short-chain lipid-conjugated fluorophores have a slightly\nhigher pKa and expanded dynamic range as compared to the\nDOPE-conjugated derivative (Table 2), probably due to diﬀer-\nences\nin\ntheir\npositioning\nand\ninteractions\nwith\nthe\nmembrane.\nTo verify the usefulness of short-chain lipid-conjugation for\nreconstitution, recovery of the pH sensors after a classical\nreconstitution procedure was determined.13,22,23 Liposomes\ndoped with lipid-conjugated fluorescent pH indicators were\ndestabilized using the detergent n-octylglucoside (OG) and\nreconstituted\nby\ndetergent\nremoval\nbased\non\nSephadex\nG-50 gel filtration and subsequent Bio-Bead treatment.

These data suggest that the albumin treatment\neﬃciently removed C16C6-PE-pHrodo from the outer vesicle\nleaflet and thus resulted in vesicles carrying the pH sensors\nexclusively in the inner membrane leaflet. The inner mem-\nbrane localization of the lipid-conjugated sensor in proteolipo-\nsomes was stable for at least 24 h (ESI, Fig. S4†). Importantly,\nthe activity of the H+ pumps was preserved after these treat-\nments: upon addition of ATP and Mg2+ to the labelled proteoli-\nposomes, an increase in the fluorescence intensity of C16C6-\nPE-pHrodo Red was observed, corresponding to the acidifica-\ntion of the internal volume of the liposomes; no increase in\nthe signal was observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3B). The\naddition of the protonophore CCCP abolished this eﬀect, con-\nfirming the active H+ transport into the proteoliposomes. The\nincreases in the normalized fluorescence signal for symmetri-\ncally and asymmetrically labelled proteoliposomes are similar,\ndemonstrating the integrity of the recovered proteoliposomes\nafter albumin treatment and flotation.

Subsequent incubation of the dual-labelled\ncells in dye-free medium with albumin resulted in a rapid\nreduction of the pHrodo Green dextran labelling, while the\nC16C6-PE pHrodo Red labelling was still visible after 45 min\n(ESI, Fig. S8†). To demonstrate the feasibility of pH calibration,\ncells were loaded with C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red and exposed to\nexternal solutions buﬀered at pH values from 2.5 to 7 and con-\ntaining 140 mM KCl and nigericin/valinomycin, ionophores\nthat exchange K+ for H+ across membranes and equilibrate\nintra- and extracellular pH values. The pH-induced variations\nof the fluorescence followed the same trend and a similar pKa\nof 5.1 was determined, as measured for the liposome-\nembedded sensor (ESI, Fig. S9 and S3F†).\nMetabolism of internalized C16C6-PE-pHrodo Red was negli-\ngible during the incubation time: less than 10% of the sensor\nwas converted into other derivatives within 30 min at 37 °C as\nrevealed by TLC analysis of lipid extracts prepared from cells\n(ESI, Fig. S10A†). MTT assay studies confirmed insignificant\ntoxicity of C16C6-PE-pHrodo lipids toward living cells at con-\ncentrations between 10 and 20 µM (ESI, Fig. S10B†). We con-\nclude that C16C6-PE pHrodo Red allows for the monitoring of\npH changes from neutral to acidic conditions in the endocytic\npathway of living cells.\nConclusions\nWe presented an improved synthesis for a set of novel fluo-\nrescent pHrodo dyes attached to phosphoethanolamines of\ndiﬀerent acyl chain lengths. All lipid-conjugated dyes show\nstrong fluorescence increase under acidic conditions, which\nrenders them suitable for single vesicle studies. The short-\nchain lipid-conjugated sensors partition eﬃciently into mem-\nbranes\nand\ncan\nbe\nback-extracted\nfrom\nmembranes\nby\nalbumin. These two key features enable the leaflet-selective\nlabelling of liposomes to study H+ translocation by membrane-\nbound enzymes in reconstituted membrane systems, as exem-\nplified by the analysis of a model plant H+ pump. The exclu-\nsive luminal location of the sensor molecules eliminates the\nneed for correction of the signal from fluorophores in the\nouter monolayer of liposomes and thus permits direct cali-\nbration of the fluorescence changes to changes in pH. This sig-\nnificantly reduces the complexity of the calibration process,\nand furthermore opens up the possibility for studying other\nion transporters, e.g. Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases, through the\ndevelopment of short-chain lipid-conjugated sensors for the\nrelevant ion species. Measurements based on conventional\nlong-chain lipid-conjugated ion sensors are diﬃcult in such\nstudies since the required addition of the ions to the assay\nbuﬀer would lead to their binding to the outer-leaflet located\nfluorophores, causing a strong background signal (Fig. 1).\nLeaflet-specific labelling by short-chain lipid sensors over-\ncomes this problem. In general, this approach could be inter-\nesting for eﬃcient loading of fluorophores inside of vesicles\nfor\na\nvariety\nof\nstudies\nsuch\nas\npermeability\ntests.27\nFurthermore, the short-chain lipid-conjugated pH sensors\nenable the monitoring of pH changes in the endocytic pathway\nof living cells. This strategy might be useful for stable trapping\nof the sensors within the endocytic pathway of cells.\nIn summary, the new set of lipid-conjugated pH sensors\nopen up a wide range of biophysical and biological appli-\ncations. Extension of this approach towards the design of\nshort-chain lipid-conjugated sensors capable of selectively\nrecognizing other ion species will allow the study of other ion\ntransporters.\nConﬂicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Anne-Mette Bjerg Petersen for excellent tech-\nnical assistance.

Aaron∥and Angie Gelli*\nDepartment of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, 3503 Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility, 451\nHealth Sciences Drive, Davis, California 95616, United States\n*\nS Supporting Information\nABSTRACT: Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is the leading cause of fungal\nmeningitis primarily in immunosuppressed patients. Cn invades the\ncentral nervous system by overcoming the highly restricted blood−brain\nbarrier (BBB). We previously determined that a secreted fungal\nmetalloprotease, Mpr1, that also confers crossing ability to yeast upon\nCnMPR1 expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is central to this process.\nThis led us to question whether Mpr1 could be engineered to function as\npart of a nanocarrier delivery vehicle. Here, a eukaryotic expression system\nproduced proteolytically active Mpr1 recombinant protein that was\nsuccessfully conjugated to functionalized quantum dot (QD) nano-\nparticles and readily internalized by brain microvascular endothelial cells.\nAn in vitro BBB model showed QD-Mpr1 crossed the BBB signiﬁcantly better than mock QD, and QD-Mpr1 did not damage\nBBB integrity. Internalization of QD-Mpr1 occurred by membrane invaginations and endocytic pits typical of receptor-mediated\nendocytosis involving clathrin-coated entry points. This study substantiates the notion that fungal mechanisms of BBB entry\nmay be harnessed for new drug delivery platform technologies.\nKEYWORDS: Pichia pastoris, metalloprotease, Mpr1, blood−brain barrier, quantum dots, mass spectrometry, TEM, nanoparticles,\nCryptococcus neoformans\nT\nhe blood−brain barrier (BBB) regulates the movement of\noxygen, nutrients, ions, and immune cells from blood to\nthe brain. It is now recognized that the BBB functions as an\nintegral part of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which is\ncomposed of astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and neurons.1\nThe intricate cellular crosstalk within the NVU is central to the\nproper development and function of the central nervous\nsystem (CNS).1 The highly specialized brain microvascular\nendothelial cells of the BBB form tight intercellular junctions\nand maintain a transendothelial electrical resistance that\nprevents paracellular entry of substances.1 A very low rate of\npinocytosis across the BBB further restricts movement of\nsubstances via a transcellular route. Collectively, these distinct\nfeatures prevent most small molecules and essentially all large\nmolecules from crossing the BBB and entering the brain.\nAlthough the highly restrictive nature of the BBB ensures that\nthe brain is protected from noxious chemicals and other\nthreats, it is the main reason why therapeutics cannot enter the\nCNS and why treating neurological diseases is extremely\nchallenging.\nA subset of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and some\nthermotolerant fungi can make their way into the CNS by\nusing a variety of mechanisms to breach the BBB.2−6 In some\ncases, microorganisms will disrupt the tight junctions in\nbetween brain microvascular endothelial cells and open up a\nparacellular pathway. Some make use of monocytes/macro-\nphages to cross the BBB, while others exploit endocytosis and\naccess the CNS via a transcellular crossing. Following\ninhalation of its infectious spores, the fungal basidiomycete\nCryptococcus neoformans (Cn) crosses the BBB and causes\nmeningoencephalitis primarily in immunosuppressed individ-\nuals.7 Cn can utilize diﬀerent mechanisms for BBB traversal;\nhowever, a vast amount of research supports the notion that a\ndirect interaction between cell wall bound/secreted proteins of\nCn and surface molecules of the brain endothelium constitutes\nthe main route used during CNS invasion.8−12 Cryptococcal\ngenes encoding hyaluronic acid synthase (CPS1),13 inositol\nreceptors (ITR1a, ITR3c),14 phospholipase B1 (PLB1),15\nvacuolar amino acid uptake (FNX1),16 ubiquitin-like protein\n(RUB1),16 and a metalloprotease (MPR1)17 all contribute to\nthe transcellular migration of Cn across the BBB.\nWe previously demonstrated that Mpr1 facilitates attach-\nment and internalization of Cn to the BBB in both in vitro and\nin vivo studies.17,18 Mpr1 was not needed for Cn to disseminate\nto the lungs, kidneys, spleen, or heart, but Mpr1 was required\nfor breaching the BBB.17 Remarkably, expressing MPR1 cDNA\nfrom Cn into the relatively nonpathogenic yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae (Sc) enabled BBB traversal of Sc.17 Mpr1 is a\nsecreted fungal metalloprotease that belongs to the inad-\nequately characterized M36 class of fungalysins.17,19,20 The\nM36 family is closely related to the bacterial M4 family of\nReceived:\nSeptember 12, 2019\nPublished: December 10, 2019\nArticle\npubs.acs.org/journal/aidcbc\nCite This: ACS Infect.

After entering the secretory\npathway, Mpr1 likely acquires its mature form by exogenous or\nautoproteolytic cleavage of its prodomain.20 The crystal\nstructure of the archetype of the M36 fungalysin (MEP) in\nAspergillus fumigatus revealed that MEP autoproteolyzes its N-\nterminal prodomain, releasing the C-terminal active polypep-\ntide with its zinc-associated ligands.19\nThe hCMEC/D3 cell line used in this study is the best\ncharacterized BBB cell line, and its usefulness as an in vitro\nmodel for examining drug transport across the BBB has been\nestablished.26,27 Studies have conﬁrmed the expression and\nactivity of various ABC-transporters, the transferrin receptor\n(TfR), and also demonstrated directed P-glycoprotein trans-\nport.26 Lipophilic low molecular weight compounds can cross\nthe hCMEC/D3 monolayer to a much greater extent than the\nhydrophilic molecules, suggesting that hCMEC/D3 cells can\ndistinguish between molecules. Given that the BBB features are\nrecapitulated in the hCMEC/D3 cell line, several studies have\nused this cell line as a model for BBB interactions with\npathogens, nanocarriers, and BBB signaling.17,28−31 Our\nstudies demonstrating that Cn crosses hCMEC/D3 cells by\nan Mpr1-dependent transcellular mechanism were supported\nby in vivo studies, thus further substantiating the usefulness of\nthis cell line as an in vitro BBB model.17\nThere has been a ﬂurry of activity to develop technologies\nthat overcome the BBB, in part by exploiting resident proteins/\npathways or forcing a temporary paracellular opening.32\nDespite extensive research eﬀorts and some promising results,\na safe and eﬃcacious method of delivery across the BBB\nremains elusive.33−35 The possibility that microbial invasion\ntactics could be harnessed and developed into new\ntechnologies for the delivery of drugs into the CNS remains\nlargely unexplored.\nThe objective of this study was to establish the proof-of-\nconcept that the Mpr1 metalloprotease could be developed as\na nanoparticle drug-delivery platform that would breach brain\nmicrovascular endothelial cells. Here, we show that Mpr1\nrecombinant protein was isolated and successfully conjugated\nto nanoparticles (NP) while maintaining proteolytic activity.\nUptake of the Mpr1-NP platform by brain microvascular\nendothelial cells occurred by an endocytotic process that\npromoted transcellular crossing. The results from these studies\nlay the groundwork for the further development and\nreﬁnement of new technologies that borrow from mechanisms\nused by pathogens to cross the BBB.\n■RESULTS\nHeterologous Expression and Puriﬁcation of Mpr1.\nTo test the hypothesis that a nanocarrier conjugated to Mpr1\nprotein would selectively cross brain microvascular endothelial\ncells, it was necessary to produce ample quantities of active,\nrecombinant Mpr1. The MPR1 cDNA from Cn with a\nFigure 1. Expression of CnMpr1 in Pichia pastoris GS115. (A) A diagram of the expression vector transformed into P. pastoris.

MPR1\nexpression was conﬁrmed through genomic DNA analysis, and\nMpr1HIS6X protein expression was examined in culture. The\nclariﬁed media from cultures of P. pastoris expressing Mpr1\nwere examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, and a Western blot\nconﬁrmed the peak expression of Mpr1 protein at 48 h\nfollowing induction with 0.5% methanol (Figure 1B,C, arrow).\nImmunoﬂuorescence microscopy further conﬁrmed the\nheterologous expression of Mpr1HIS6X recombinant protein in\ncells of P. pastoris when grown in 0.5% methanol for 48 h\n(Figure 1D). In contrast, Mpr1HIS6X protein was not detected\nin a strain of P. pastoris expressing an empty vector and grown\nunder similar conditions (Figure 1D). Quantitative PCR\nestimated that 2−3 copies of MPR1 integrated in the genome\nof the P. pastoris strain; this was based on the single presence\nof an ARG4 (argininosuccinate lyase) gene in the GS115\nuntransformed strain. The strain transformed with an empty\nplasmid, and the isolate was used for expression studies (Figure\nS1).\nNow that we had determined the optimal expression\nconditions for Mpr1 protein in P. pastoris, we used Ni2+-\nNTA magnetic beads to isolate and purify Mpr1HIS6X from\nmedia collected from cultures of P. pastoris grown in 0.5%\nmethanol. Eluted Mpr1HIS6X protein was subjected to SDS-\nPAGE electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. A Coomassie\nstained polyacrylamide gel revealed a distinct band at ∼70 kDa,\nand the Western blot showed a band corresponding to\nMpr1HIS6X of similar size (Figure 2A, arrow). The 70 kDa\npolypeptide band was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and\nsent for peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry for further\nconﬁrmation since it was uncertain whether this polypeptide\ncorresponded to the active form given that the predicted\nmolecular weight of a fully processed Mpr1 protein cleaved at\nthe FDID predicted cleavage site is ∼50 kDa.\nThe MS/MS analysis identiﬁed the Mpr1 protein in the\npolypeptide band and conﬁrmed the presence of the consensus\nsequences, HEYSH and EGWGD, within Mpr1 (Figure S2).\nScaﬀold software was used to validate MS/MS based peptide\nand protein identiﬁcations. Of the 831 amino acids of the\nMpr1 predicted protein, only 370 amino acids associated with\nthe mature Mpr1 metalloprotease (i.e., lacking its prodomain)\nwere identiﬁed by MS/MS, suggesting that P. pastoris secreted\na fully processed Mpr1 protein (Figure S3). We examined\nMpr1 protein in a second protein expression system by\nexpressing MPR1 cDNA in baculovirus and infecting Sf9 insect\ncells (Figure 2B). We found that Sf9 cells secreted Mpr1HIS6X\ninto the media, and just as we had observed with P. pastoris, a\nsingle band at ∼70 kDa was also detected.\nRecombinant Mpr1 Protein Retains Proteolytic\nActivity. Following the heterologous expression of Mpr1 in\nP. pastoris, it was necessary to examine whether puriﬁed,\nrecombinant Mpr1 retained activity. To examine the\nproteolytic activity of Mpr1 recombinant protein, we used a\nprotease activity assay with FITC-casein as the substrate.\nBatches of puriﬁed Mpr1 protein isolated from P. pastoris along\nwith trypsin as an assay control were tested for activity in the\npresence of various metal ions and two diﬀerent temperatures\n(Figure 3). The assays revealed that recombinant Mpr1\nretained proteolytic activity (Figure 3). The activity of Mpr1\npeaked in the presence of Zn2+ alone (red, open square) or in\nthe presence of all ions (Zn2+, Ca2+ green, open triangle; Mg2+\npurple, open triangle) at 30 and 37 °C, but the overall activity\nwas the highest at 37 °C (Figure 3A,B). In contrast, Mpr1\nprotein in PBS alone (blue, open circle) showed signiﬁcantly\nless activity suggesting that Zn2+ was required for optimal\nactivity.\nFigure 2.

Relative ﬂuorescence was measured every 5 min at an\nexcitation of 485 nm and an emission of 538 nm.\nACS Infectious Diseases\nArticle\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00348\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 138−149\n140\n\nIn order to visualize Mpr1 protease activity, in-gel-\nzymography was used with casein as a substrate. A clear\nzone of casein digestion was observed with increasing amounts\nof Mpr1 protein between 75 and 50 kDa, while trypsin activity\nresulted in a clear zone below 20 kDa (Figure 4A, left panel).\nThe addition of EDTA, a chelator of divalent cations,\nabolished casein digestion in the presence of Mpr1 protein,\nbut it did not prevent trypsin-mediated digestion of casein\n(Figure 4A, right panel). A FITC-casein proteolytic assay\nconﬁrmed inhibition of Mpr1 activity by EDTA (Figure 4B).\nCollectively, the results suggest that expression of MPR1\ncDNA in P. pastoris produces a fully processed, secreted Mpr1\nprotein that retains Zn2+-dependent proteolytic activity.\nMpr1 Activity Is Maintained upon Conjugation to\nNanoparticles. On the basis of previous studies where we\ndemonstrated that MPR1 expression in fungi and yeast\npromoted the migration of Cn and Sc across the BBB\nrespectively, we examined whether recombinant Mpr1 could\npromote the internalization of nanoparticles by the BBB. Here,\nMpr1 recombinant protein was conjugated to nanoparticles\nthat were subsequently tracked in human brain microvascular\nendothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cell line) by ﬂuorescence\nmicroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In\nchoosing the type of nanoparticle, we selected quantum dots\n(QDs) because they are photostable, traceable due to their\nbright autoﬂuorescence, and functionalized with surface groups\nfor easy conjugation to proteins. Coupling agents 1-ethyl-3-(3-\n(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hyxdrox-\nysuccinamide (NHS) were used to activate the carboxyl group\non the surface of the QDs, allowing the newly formed ester to\nreact with primary amines on recombinant Mpr1 protein,\nforming a stable amide bond between the QDs and\nrecombinant protein (Figure 5A). Mpr1 recombinant protein\nwas proteolytically active when coupled to QDs; however, a\nslight decrease in protease activity was detected compared to\nMpr1 protein alone (Figure 5B). A similar loss in trypsin\nactivity was also detected following conjugation to the QDs.\nThe ﬂuorescence associated with the QDs was retained after\ncoupling to Mpr1 protein or trypsin and could be visualized\nunder UV excitation (Figure 5C,D).\nMpr1 Promotes Crossing of Nanoparticles in the in\nVitro Model of the BBB. The conjugation of QDs to\nproteolytically active, recombinant Mpr1 created a platform in\nwhich payloads could be subsequently attached for the\ndevelopment of a drug-delivery vehicle for the brain. Proof-\nof-concept would require that we test whether the QD-Mpr1\nformulation could penetrate brain microvascular endothelial\ncells; thus, we tested the QD-Mpr1 platform in an in vitro\nmodel of the human BBB. In this model, a human cerebral\nmicrovascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) was grown\nand diﬀerentiated on a transwell such that the upper well\nrepresented the apical side of the BBB (i.e., the blood side) and\nthe lower well represented the basolateral side (i.e., brain side)\n(Figure 6). The QDs were conjugated to trypsin, transferrin, or\nMpr1, and equal amounts of each formulation were added to\nthe apical side of the polarized monolayer of the hCMEC/D3\ncells. The association of QD-Mpr1 with the surface of the brain\nendothelial cells on transwells was conﬁrmed by confocal\nmicroscopy and appeared to be more robust compared to the\nQD-mock or QD-trypsin (data not shown).\nFollowing coincubation of 8 or 24 h, the detection of QD\nﬂuorescence on the basolateral side of the transwell would be\nindicative of barrier crossing. We found that by 24 h\nsigniﬁcantly more QD-Mpr1 ﬂuorescence was detected\ncompared to QD-mock, suggesting that QD-Mpr1 had readily\ncrossed the hCMEC/D3 monolayer (Figure 6A,B). As\nexpected, the QD-transferrin had also crossed (Figure 6A,B).\nTo assess the integrity of the barrier in the presence of the\nQD formulations, a FITC-dextran permeability assay was used.\nNormally, when hCMEC/D3 cells are fully diﬀerentiated on\nthe transwells, the barrier junctions are tight and, thus, they\nprevent a paracellular crossing of a 70 kDa dextran molecule.\nIn the case of the QD formulations, we found that the presence\nof QD-Mpr1, at 24 h, did not alter dextran permeability across\nthe BBB when compared to cells alone (Figure 6C). A similar\nobservation was made with the QD-transferrin formulation\n(Figure 6C). In contrast, the QD-mock and QD-trypsin\nappeared to promote dextran permeability, suggesting that\nthese formulations had damaged the integrity of the barrier\nwhile the QD-Mpr1 formulation had not (Figure 6C).\nMeasurements of LDH activity of hCMEC/D3 cells exposed\nto the QD formulations revealed little to no cytotoxicity of\nQD-Mpr1 (Figure 7).\nMpr1-QD Platform Penetrates Brain Microvascular\nEndothelial Cells in the in Vitro BBB Model. We sought to\nexamine the internalization pathway and intracellular traﬃck-\ning of QD-Mpr1 compared to QD alone, QD-transferrin, and\nQD-trypsin. To do this, brain microvascular endothelial cells\nFigure 4. Mpr1 protease activity is abolished by EDTA.

The QDs appeared as electron-dense\nparticles in the TEM micrographs (Figure 8, blue arrows).\nAnalysis by TEM revealed that QD-Mpr1 was readily\ninternalized by hCMEC/D3 cells (Figure 8A−F). Internal-\nization of QD-Mpr1 occurred by membrane invaginations and\nendocytic pits typical of receptor-mediated endocytosis\ninvolving either caveolea or clathrin-coated entry points\n(Figure 8A,B, indicated as number 1). Clathrin-coated buds\nwere observed at the base of the endocytic pit (yellow arrows,\nFigure 8B). QD-Mpr1 was observed within vesicular structures\nthat resembled multivesicular endosomes (MVE) and\nlysosomes (L) (Figure 8C−E, indicated by numbers 2, 3,\nand 4).\nThe QD-Mpr1 was more readily internalized than QD alone\n(Figure 8G, yellow arrow) and appeared to render far less\nmembrane damage compared to QD-trypsin, where we\nobserved a signiﬁcant breach of the BBB via paracellular\naccumulation (Figure 8I, yellow arrows). In addition,\nendocytic pits at the surface of the plasma membrane were\nnot observed in the presence of QD alone or QD-trypsin\n(Figure 8G,I). In contrast, the QD-transferrin was readily\ninternalized by endocytic vesicles and appeared to accumulate\nwithin vesicular structures, similar to QD-Mpr1 (Figure 8H,\nyellow arrows).\n■DISCUSSION\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that Cn exploits multiple\nroutes of entry to access the CNS, aided in part by the\nexpression of surface-bound and secreted factors that can\novercome the BBB.8,9,36−38 We propose that unraveling tactics\nused by Cn to access the CNS will reveal mechanisms that\ncould be harnessed for the development of technologies used\nto deliver drugs across the tightly regulated BBB. The goal of\nthis study was to establish the proof-of-concept that Mpr1\ncould be constructed as part of a nanoparticle delivery system\nable to breach brain microvascular endothelial cells. In a\nprevious study, strains of Cn expressing mutants of Mpr1 with\namino acid substitutions of residues that coordinate zinc or\nthat constitute the predicted active site could not cross brain\nmicrovascular endothelial cells in an in vitro model of the\nhuman BBB, indicating a requirement for the proteolytic\nactivity of Mpr1.25 In order to produce signiﬁcant amounts of\nactive and pure Mpr1 recombinant protein, we made use of the\nPichia pastoris eukaryotic expression system. It oﬀered several\nadvantages including simple genetic manipulation, easy scale\nFigure 5. Mpr1 recombinant protein retains proteolytic activity upon conjugation to quantum dot nanoparticles.

Unprocessed Mpr1 (with the\nprodomain attached) has a predicted molecular weight of ∼91\nkDa\n(based\non\nthe\nNCBI\nreference\nsequence\nXP_012051981.1). Several observations would suggest that\nexpression of CnMPR1 cDNA in Pichia pastoris did produce a\nsecreted and proteolytically mature form of Mpr1 protein.\nFirst, the expression of CnMPR1 cDNA in the baculovirus-Sf9\ninsect cells expression system produced a single, secreted\npolypeptide of a similar molecular weight (∼70 kDa). Second,\nthe tandem mass spectral analysis of the 70 kDa excised\npolypeptide band conﬁrmed the expression of Mpr1 and\nidentiﬁed the amino acids (370) immediately following the\npredicted cleavage site of the prodomain that corresponded to\nthe fully processed from of Mpr1.25 Finally, the in-gel\nFigure 6.

(A) A schematic\nrepresentation of the in vitro static model of the human blood−brain\nbarrier (BBB) used for transcytosis assays. Brain microvascular\nendothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cell line) are grown and diﬀerentiated\non transwells such that the upper well represents the apical side and\nthe bottom well represents the basolateral side of the BBB. (B)\nConjugated QDs were incubated with hCMEC/D3 cells in the in vitro\nBBB model for 24 h. The relative ﬂuorescence of media collected\nfrom the lower wells was measured at an excitation of 488 nm and an\nemission of 605 nm. Signiﬁcantly more QD-Mpr1 crossed the BBB\ncompared to other formulations. (C) Integrity of the BBB was\nmonitored by FITC-dextran permeability across hCMECs/D3 cells in\nthe in vitro model of the BBB following 24 h of coincubation. The\npermeability assay showed little to no FITC-dextran crossing in the\npresence of QD-Mpr1 (indicated by the blue arrow), suggesting the\nbarrier integrity was not damaged by QD-Mpr1.\nFigure 7. QD-Mpr1 formulation is not cytotoxic to brain micro-\nvascular endothelial cells. LDH activity was measured in hCMEC/D3\ncells exposed to QD formulations. The ratio of LDH activity relative\nto media alone shows that Mpr1-QD does not induce LDH activity,\nsuggesting QD-Mpr1 is not cytotoxic.\nFigure 8.

The\nnumbers 1−4 represent the following: 1, membrane invaginations and\nendocytic pit formation allow the uptake of QD-Mpr1; 2, 3, and 4\nvesicular structures containing and releasing QD-Mpr1.\nACS Infectious Diseases\nArticle\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00348\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 138−149\n143\n\nzymography clearly demonstrated the proteolytic activity of the\n∼70 kDa polypeptide band corresponding to Mpr1.\nCollectively, the results demonstrated that P. pastoris\nsecreted a fully processed, active Mpr1 protein that appeared\nto run slightly higher on an SDS-PAGE gel than its predicted\nmolecular weight. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that Mpr1 dimerization may account for the larger\npolypeptide band. Although other members of the M36 class\nof fungalysins are not known to form dimers, some\nmetalloproteases such as MMP-2 have been shown to form\nCa2+-dependent, reduction-sensitive homodimers.40 Further\nstudies will be needed to examine whether Mpr1 proteolytic\nactivity is dependent on homo- or heterodimerization.\nBoth inorganic (iron-oxide) and organic (liposomes and\nprotein based) nanoparticles have been approved by the FDA\nin the United States and by the EMA in the European Union\nfor various clinical indications, including imaging, diagnostics,\ncancer-related treatments, and vaccines.41 Others, such as\nmicelles, silica, and gold nanoparticles are being investigated in\nclinical trials for their use as cancer drugs and in thermal\nablation of tumors.41 For the purpose of our study, which was\nto establish the proof-of-concept that Mpr1 could function to\ndrive NPs across the BBB, we chose QDs (Qdot ITK carboxyl\nquantum dot nanocrystals) because they are traceable due to\ntheir bright autoﬂuorescence, photostable, and functionalized\nwith surface groups for easy conjugation to Mpr1.42 In our\nstudy, carboxyl groups on the surface of the QDs were\nactivated and conjugated to primary amine groups of Mpr1\nprotein via a covalent linkage. We found that Mpr1\nrecombinant protein could be successfully conjugated to\nfunctionalized NPs, while maintaining its proteolytic activity.\nThe Mpr1-conjugated QDs were approximately 15−20 nm\n(based on the manufacturer’s assessment) in size and consisted\nof a CdSe core shelled with an additional semiconductor layer\n(ZnS). The small size of the Mpr1-QDs allowed for the\neﬃcient uptake by cells, and given that the smallest capillaries\nare ∼5−6 μm in diameter, a drug-delivery vehicle would need\nto be signiﬁcantly smaller than 5 μm to ensure adequate\ndistribution into the bloodstream.33 While the CdSe and ZnS\nelements of the core and shell may ultimately not be favorable\ndue to potential Cd accumulation at target sites within the\nCNS, our studies found that QD-Mpr1 has little to no\ncytotoxicity when tested in vitro.\nWe used hCMEC/D3 cells in transwells as an in vitro\nmonolayer of the BBB to examine the fate of Mpr1-conjugated\nnanoparticles. The hCMEC/D3 cell line was previously\nestablished as a robust in vitro model of the human\nBBB.26,27,29 The Mpr1-conjugated QDs were readily internal-\nized by hCMEC/D3 cells via membrane invaginations and\nendocytic pits. At the base of the endocytic pits, clathrin-\ncoated buds were readily detected. These observations are\nconsistent with other studies that found that the internalization\nof nanoparticles <200 nm occurred by the clathrin-dependent\npathway.30,31,43 We found that QDs alone were not readily\ninternalized. Some studies found that nanoparticles alone with\na net cationic charge enter cells via the adsorptive endocytotic\nroute due to the negative charge associated with cell\nmembranes.33 In our case, the net negative charge of the\ncarboxyl groups on the QDs may have reduced entry via this\nprocess, and this may account for the lack of QDs observed\nwithin brain microvascular endothelial cells. In contrast, the\nQD-Mpr1 particles readily cross the BBB, suggesting that\nMpr1 may have activated endocytosis by proteolytically\nprocessing a transmembrane protein that can be internalized\nby the clathrin-dependent pathway in order to facilitate entry.\nWe have established that Mpr1 mediates the transcytosis of Cn\nacross the BBB, and although the protein targets of Mpr1 are\nnot known, it is likely that a similar target/pathway acts to\ninternalize Mpr1-conjugated QDs. A potential target of Mpr1\nis CD44, a glycoprotein receptor that binds Cn via hyaluronic\nacid (HA). Knockdown of CD44 in brain microvascular\nendothelial cells signiﬁcantly reduced the adherence of Cn,44,45\nand mice deﬁcient in CD44 (CD44−/−knockout mice)\nshowed improved survival and less brain fungal burden\nfollowing inoculation with Cn.44 Interestingly, CD44 has\nbeen shown to undergo proteolytic cleavage by membrane-\nassociated metalloproteases resulting in CD44-mediated\nsignaling, but further studies are needed to demonstrate\nMpr1 involvement.46,47 Studies have also shown that coating\nnanoparticles with HA promotes binding to CD44 and\nenhances uptake by cells.48\nOnce internalized, QD-Mpr1 was observed within vesicular\nstructures that resembled multivesicular endosomes and\nlysosomes. A transcytosis mechanism was likely the basis for\nQD-Mpr1 crossing of the BBB since tight junctions remained\nintact and the traﬃcking of QD-Mpr1 was similar to TfR-\nmediated transcytosis of QD-transferrin.35 How Mpr1 targets\nthe relevant pathway that promotes transcytosis and not\ndegradation remains to be seen, but a recent study\ndemonstrating that sorting tubules in brain endothelial cells\nmay regulate receptor-mediated transcytosis across the BBB\ncould provide some insight.49\nIn conclusion, the results support the proof-of-concept that\nMpr1 metalloprotease could be developed as a nanoparticle\ndrug-delivery platform. This study also demonstrates that\nfungal pathogens able to penetrate the BBB may hold a wealth\nof untapped information that could yield signiﬁcant insights\ninto how to best breach the BBB.\n■MATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains, Media, and Cell Culture (in Vitro Blood−Brain\nBarrier Model). Plasmid pUC57K-MPR1LV, a vector with\nthe CnMPR1 cDNA (Broad Institute No. CNAG_04735) was\npurchased from GenScript Inc. (NJ, USA). Escherichia coli a-\nselect was purchased from Bioline, Inc. Pichia pastoris wild-type\nstrain GS115 and the expression vector pPIC9K plasmid were\npurchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA).

Secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP)-conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)\nused for Western blot was obtained from Abcam Inc. and\nThermoFisher Scientiﬁc.\nA human brain capillary endothelial cell line (labeled as,\nhCMEC/D3) was obtained from Dr. Weksler (Cornell\nUniversity) who developed and characterized this cell line as\nan in vitro model for the human blood−brain barrier.27,29 This\ncell line recapitulates properties of primary brain microvascular\nendothelial cells and has been used extensively in laboratory\nsettings.17,26,27,50 The in vitro static monolayer model of the\nhuman BBB consisted of a transwell apparatus with the lower\nchamber representing the abluminal (basolateral) side and\nupper chamber representing the luminal (apical) side separated\nby a porous membrane (8 μM, Corning). The hCMEC/D3\ncells used for the transcytosis assay were between passages 20\nACS Infectious Diseases\nArticle\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00348\nACS Infect. Dis. 2020, 6, 138−149\n144\n\nand 30. A conﬂuent monolayer in a 25 cm2 culture ﬂask was\ntrypsinized and resuspended in 9 mL of cell culture medium.\n1.25 × 105 hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded in rich endothelial\ngrowth medium (EBM-2, Lonza) with growth factors and\nantibiotics (gentamicin and amphotericin B) on a collagen-\ncoated transwell insert. Once added to the transwell apparatus,\nthe hCMEC/D3 cells were cultured for approximately 2 weeks\nat 37 °C and 5% CO2. During the 2-week incubation, the\nmedium (concentration of supplements) was changed from\n1×-strength on days 3 and 6 to 0.5×-strength on day 9 and\n0.25×-strength on day 12 and used in the assay on days 12−\n14. The use of the lower-strength medium was required to\nreduce the growth factors in the medium in order to promote\ncell diﬀerentiation and tight junction formation. The integrity\nof the barrier was monitored by FITC-dextran (70 kDa)\npermeability assays.\nConstruction of Expression Vectors. The Mpr1 cDNA\nfrom C. neoformans var. grubii was synthesized by GenScript\nCo (NJ, USA), ligated into pUC57K plasmid (pUC57K-\nMpr1LV), and ampliﬁed by PCR with forward primer 5′\nCCTCATGAATTCATGCGCTCCTCCGCGCTCATC-\nGCTCTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′ ATGGCGGCCGCTCAA-\nTGGTGATGGTGATGATGAGCCTTTTTGGACTCGCA-\n3′. These oligonucleotides included an EcoRI and a NotI\nrestriction site for cloning into the EcoRI and the NotI site of\nthe P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCalifornia). A 6× histidine tag was inserted at the C-terminal\ncoding region of the full-length MPR1 gene using a reverse\nprimer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI\nand cloned into the same sites of pPIC9K. The recombinant\nplasmid pPIC9K-MPR1LV was transformed into competent\nE. coli, and the fragment was validated by restriction enzyme\ndigestion with EcoRI and NotI and conﬁrmed by DNA\nsequencing. The prediction of signal peptides and their\ncleavage sites was performed with SignalP (http://www.cbs.\ndtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Brieﬂy, the N-terminal cleavable\nsignal peptide of the MPR1 gene was removed with the\nforward primer 5′ CCCCATCATCGTGAGGATAAGCATA-\n3′ and reverse primer 5′ GAATTCTACGTAAGCTTCAG-\nCCTCT-3′. The reconstructed gene was ligated into the\neukaryotic expression vector pPIC9K to generate the\nrecombinant plasmid pPIC9K-MPR1LV_NOSS.\nTransformation of P. pastoris and Selection of\nTransformants. PmeI was used to linearize 5−10 μg of\npPIC9K-MPR1LV plasmid DNA, and linear DNA was\ntransformed into competent P. pastoris strain GS115 using\nelectroporation (Bio-Rad; 1.5 kV, 200 Ω, 25 μF, and 4.5 m).\npPIC9K blank plasmid vector alone was also linearized and\ntransformed into P. pastoris GS115 as a negative control. The\ntransformed yeast cells were spread on minimal dextrose\nmedium (MD) plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2−4 days. A\ntotal of 384 His-positive transformants were selected on the\nMD plates (histidine free) and screened in vivo by their\nresistance to G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). YPD\nplates containing G418 of three concentrations (1.5, 3.0, 4.0\nmg/mL) were used to screen multicopy integrants in the yeast\ncolonies. Transformants of multicopy colonies were puriﬁed,\nassayed for their methanol utilization, and tested for the\nexpression of Mpr1 proteins. Yeast genomic DNA was\nextracted after growth in 5 mL of minimal glycerol medium\n(MGY, 1.34% YNB, 1% glycerol, 20 mg of biotin) overnight at\n30 °C and shaken. Cells were added to 1× Lite Lysis Buﬀer\n(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM\nEDTA, pH 8, 0.1% nonident-40, 0.006% 1 M DTT, 0.006%\nyeast protease inhibitors) and lysed with 0.5 mm acid-washed\nglass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 5× for 1 min on\nice. Genomic DNA was precipitated, and lysate was clariﬁed by\ncentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was\nsubjected to a phenol/chloroform extraction. Genomic DNA\nconcentration was measured using Nanodrop (ThermoFisher\nScientiﬁc). PCR ampliﬁcation was performed as follows: initial\ndenaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 ampliﬁcation\ncycles (30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 45 s of annealing at 55\n°C, and 1 min elongation at 72 °C) and a ﬁnal elongation at 72\n°C for 10 min.\nExpression and Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Mpr1\nProtein. The recombinant P. pastoris strains were grown in\n100 mL of BMGY medium (0.1 M potassium phosphate buﬀer\npH 6.0 containing 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 13 g/\nL yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 10 mL/L glycerol,\nand 20 mg/L biotin) at 30 °C and 250 rpm until the culture\nreached an OD600 of 2.0−6.0 (16 h). The cells were harvested\nby centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, washed three\ntimes in BMMY medium (0.1 M potassium phosphate buﬀer\npH 6.0 containing 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 13 g/\nL yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% methanol, and\n20 mg/L biotin), resuspended in BMMY at a ﬁnal OD600 of\n1.0, and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm, and\nmethanol was added every 24 h to give a ﬁnal concentration of\n0.5%.\nAt the start of induction, Ni-NTA MagBeads (CubeBiotech,\nPA) were added to the P. pastoris culture medium. After 48 h\nof induction, cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for\n10 min, and the Ni-NTA MagBeads were separated from the\nculture supernatant and cell pellet using a magnetic stand. The\nNi-NTA MagBeads were washed once with wash buﬀer (50\nmM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Elution\nwas completed in a stepwise manner with elution buﬀer (50\nmM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). The\neluted protein was concentrated and exchanged with 1×\nphosphate buﬀered saline using 10 kDa Amicon ﬁlters\n(Millipore, USA). Protein concentration was measured via\nthe Bradford Assay (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA,\nUSA).\nMpr1 Expression in Baculovirus. The gene fragment\nencoding the Mpr1 protein of C. neoformans var. grubii was\nsynthesized by GenScript Co (NJ, USA) and ampliﬁed from\nplasmid by PCR with forward primer 5′ CCTCATGAA-\nTTCATGCGCTCCTCCGCGCTCATCGCTCTT-3′, re-\nverse primer 5′ ATGGCGGCCGCTCAATGGTGA-\nTGGTGATGATGA GCCTTTTTGGACTC GCA-3′, and\npUC57K-Mpr1LV as the template. These oligonucleotides\ninclude an EcoRI and a NotI restriction site for cloning into\nthe EcoRI and the NotI site of the baculovirus expression\nvector pBV1393. A 6× histidine tag was inserted to the C-\nterminal coding region of the full-length MPR1 gene using\nreverse primer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and\nNotI and cloned into the same sites of pBV1393. The\nrecombinant plasmid pBV1393-MPR1LV was transformed\ninto competent E. coli, and the fragment was validated by\nrestriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI and NotI and\nconﬁrmed by DNA sequencing.

The electrophoresis was performed at a constant\nvoltage of 90 V for 120 min, and the gel was stained with\nCoomassie brilliant R-250. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE\nwere transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)\nmembrane using the Transfer Blot SD Cell (Biorad). The\nmembrane was blocked in 5% milk prepared in Tris-buﬀered\nsaline containing 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST) and then incubated\nwith mouse-anti-His-Tag antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Neuro-\nmab, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C.

Proteo-\nlytic activity of Mpr1 recombinant protein was assayed using a\nProtease Activity Assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,\nMA), utilizing FITC-labeled casein. Mpr1 samples were used\nat a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Trypsin (control) samples\nwere used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. Fluorescence\nmeasurements were recorded in a Spectramax M5 multilabel\nplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at an\nexcitation of 485 nm and an emission of 538 nm at 5 min\nintervals for 60 min at 30 and 37 °C. Changes in ﬂuorescence\nover time were plotted against a standard curve generated from\ntrypsin. Media supplements in the assay include 1 mM ZnSO4,\n0.49 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2, or PBS alone.\nFor zymography, recombinant Mpr1 was isolated from\nP. pastoris and various amounts of protein were loaded onto a\n12% Zymogram (casein) Tris-glycine gel (ThermoFisher\nScientiﬁc) and ran in SDS buﬀer for 3 h at 90 V. Recombinant\ntrypsin was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc. SDS was\nwashed in Renaturation Buﬀer (2% Triton-X-100) by washing\n3× for 10 min at RT. The gel was incubated in Developing\nBuﬀer with or without EDTA (10 mM) overnight at 37 °C\nwith agitation. To visualize proteolysis, the gel was stained with\nCoomassie for 30 min and destained for 2 h.\nQuantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Genomic DNA was isolated\nas previously mentioned. Real-time PCR ampliﬁcation was\nperformed using an ABI 7300 instrument with Sequence\nDetection Software SDS v1.2 (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1).\nReal-time PCR mixtures were prepared using the Power SYBR\nGreen Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). For SYBR Green\nexaminations, 200 nM of each primer was added to the 1×\nPower SYBR Green Master Mix. Reactions were performed in\nquadruplicate. Genomic DNA (2 ng) was added to a reaction\nvolume of 20 μL. For each strain, reactions with Mpr1 and\nARG4 primer sets were performed in separate tubes. Standard\ncurves and NTCs for both genes were recorded in every plate.\nThe reactions were done in MicroAmp Optical 96-Well\nreaction plates sealed with MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Covers\n(Applied Biosystems). The thermal proﬁle initiates with a 10\nmin step at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1\nmin at 60 °C. The data collection of the ﬂuorescence signal\nwas performed at the end of the elongation step. The\nampliﬁcation period was followed by a melting curve analysis\nwith a temperature gradient of 0.1 °C/s from 70° to 95 °C to\nexclude ampliﬁcation of unspeciﬁc products.\nMass Spectrometry Analysis. The protein band was\nexcised from the Coomasie-stained gels and analyzed by MS/\nMS at the UC Davis Proteomics Core. For database searching,\nall MS/MS samples were analyzed using X! Tandem (The\nGPM, thegpm.org; version CYCLONE (2013.02.01.1)). X!\nTandem was set up to search the uniprot-_20150303__tnLxu\ndatabase (90 486 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme\ntrypsin. X! Tandem was searched with a fragment ion mass\ntolerance of 20 ppm and a parent ion tolerance of 20 ppm.\nCarbamidomethyl of cysteine was speciﬁed in X! Tandem as a\nﬁxed modiﬁcation. Glu →pyro-Glu of the N-terminus,\nammonia-loss of the N-terminus, gln →pyro-Glu of the N-\nterminus, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation\nof methionine and tryptophan, and dioxidation of methionine,\ntryptophan, and acetyl of the N-terminus were speciﬁed in X!\nTandem as variable modiﬁcations. The criteria for protein\nidentiﬁcation was as follows : Scaﬀold (version Scaﬀold_4.7.5,\nProteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate\nMS/MS based peptide and protein identiﬁcations. Peptide\nidentiﬁcations were accepted if they could be established at\ngreater than 50.0% probability by the Scaﬀold Local FDR\nalgorithm. Protein identiﬁcations were accepted if they could\nbe established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained\nat least 1 identiﬁed peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned\nby the Protein Prophet algorithm.51 Proteins that contained\nsimilar peptides and could not be diﬀerentiated on the basis of\nMS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of\nparsimony. Proteins sharing signiﬁcant peptide evidence were\ngrouped into clusters.\nImmunoﬂuorescence. P. pastoris was induced for 48 h in\nBMMY, diluted 1:50, and plated on collagen coated coverslips.\nCells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room\ntemperature and then washed in 1× PBS. Coverslips were\nincubated with primary antibody mouse-anti-His-tag antibody\n(1:1000 dilution) (Neuromab, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The\ncells were washed once with 1× PBS. Secondary antibody\n(goat-antimouse antibody AF555) was used at a dilution of\n1:2000 (Abcam, Inc.). Samples were mounted and viewed with\nTable 1.

Qdot ITK Carboxyl Quantum\nDots (Invitrogen/Thermoﬁsher Scientiﬁc) were washed in\nMES, pH 6, using 10 kDa Amicon ﬁlters. Quantum dots were\nactivated in 200 mM EDC and 200 mM NHS for 1 h at RT.\nQuantum dots were washed in fresh MES and incubated with\nMpr1, trypsin (1 mg/mL), or transferrin in a ﬁnal volume of\n0.5 mL at 4 °C overnight. Mpr1-QDs were washed in a 50 kDa\namicon to remove unconjugated Mpr1 protein. Fluorescence\nintensities at 488 nm excitation and 605 nm emission were\nobserved using Spectramax M5 multilabel plate reader\n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protease activity of\nMpr1-QD was measured as stated above.\nQDs across the BBB in Vitro. The transcytosis assays were\nperformed by washing hCMEC/D3 cells with PBS and adding\nfresh 0.25×-strength EGM-2 without phenol red. To half of the\nwells, the medium in the upper chamber contained 1 mg/mL\nFITC-dextran 70 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantum dots alone\nor conjugated to Mpr1 or trypsin were added to the top\nchamber of the transwell and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2\nfor 24 h. Fluorescence was ﬁrst read at an excitation of 488 nm\nand an emission of 605 nm for the quantum dots. FITC\nﬂuorescence was measured second at 495 nm excitation and\n515 nm emission. Wells without FITC dextran were assayed\nfor lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using the lactate\ndehydrogenase assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich), measuring absorb-\nance at 490 nm for 30 min at 37 °C, and taking the highest\ntime point reading before absorbance exceeded the maximum\ntested standard. LDH activity was calculated using a NADH\nstandard set provided by the kit.\nConfocal Microscopy. After 24 h, transwells were washed\ntwice in 1× PBS and ﬁxed in methanol for 20 min at −20 °C,\nwashed with acetone, and washed with 1× PBS. Transwell\nmembranes were excised and mounted with VectaMount HQ\n(Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8\nSTED 3X confocal microscope. Images were processed using\nImageJ.\nTransmission Electron Microscopy. For TEM, hCMEC/\nD3 cells were incubated with QD-mock, QD-transferrin, QD-\nMpr1, or QD-trypsin. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5%\nCO2, the cell culture media was removed, and the hCMEC/D3\ncells were ﬁxed in modiﬁed Karnovsky’s ﬁxative and submitted\nto the Biological Electron Microscopy Core Laboratory,\nTupper Hall, University of California, Davis, for TEM sample\npreparation. TEM imaging was obtained with a TEM\nmicroscope (Talos L120C; F.E.I. Company, Hillsboro, OR,\nUSA), and images were acquired using the integrated FEI Ceta\nCMOS camera.\nStatistical Analysis. The data are expressed as the means\n± SD. The statistical signiﬁcance was established at p < 0.05\n(*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005). A standard t test with\nWelch’s correction was used for the comparison of two groups,\nand a one-way ANOVA was used when two or more groups\nwere compared. Commercially available software (Prism\nGraphPad version 8.0.2) was used for all statistical analyses.\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nS\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00348.\nFigure S1, quantitative PCR; Figure S2, MS/MS spectral\nanalysis; Figure S3, amino acid sequence of Mpr1\nprotein from Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (strain\nH99) (PDF)\nSpecial Issue Paper\nThis paper was intended for the Central Nervous System-\nRelated Pathogens special issue [ACS Infect.

Traditional genetic\nanalysis strategies aim to identify the most significant genes involved\nin biological processes but fail to portray the comprehensive genetic\narchitecture of complex traits. It is increasingly recognized that gene\nregulatory networks (GRNs) can serve as powerful tools to dissect\ngenotype–phenotype relationships (Baraba´si et al., 2011). A GRN is\nthe mathematical formulation of a graph in which nodes represent\ngenes or gene products and edges represent gene–gene interactions.\nThe effective use of GRNs to unveil biological and medical complex-\nities relies on the reconstruction of informative networks that cap-\nture key network properties, including the potential causality of\ninteractions, the direction of the relationship and the strength of\ninteractions. Subject to Darwin’s natural selection, gene networks\nmay change over time and space and vary in response to genetic\nalterations and environmental signals (Anholt, 2020). This dynamic\nproperty of GRNs implies the importance of identifying context-\nspecific or personalized networks to further the mechanistic under-\nstanding of diseases.\nIn network science, existing approaches for inferring dynamic\nand informative networks require the availability of high-density\ntemporal or perturbed data. With such data, a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) is derived and applied to characterize\nthe detailed architecture of functional interactions and their changes\nover time, which could be more informative than association-based\nnetwork (Fujita et al., 2007; Yuan and Lin, 2007). Many statistical\nmethods have been developed to solve various forms of ODEs in net-\nwork reconstruction, including the nonlinear least squares method\n(Biegler et al., 1986; Rodriguez-Fernandez et al., 2006), the\ncollocation-based approach (Ramsay et al., 2007; Varah, 1982) and\nsome variants of collocation (Brunel et al., 2014; Dattner and\nKlaassen,\n2015).\nTo\nresolve\nthe\nchallenges\nof\nusing\nhigh-\ndimensional data, Wu et al. (2014) and Henderson and Michailidis\n(2014) used a two-step collocation method to quantify the ODEs\nand also applied some sparse-inducing penalties, i.e. least absolute\nshrinkage and selection operator (LASSO; Tibshirani, 1996), group-\nLASSO (Yuan and Lin, 2007) and adaptive LASSO (Zou, 2006), to\ninfer a sparse network structure. Chen et al. (2017) considered the\napproach of Dattner and Klaassen (2015) of integrating ODEs into\noriginal scales, together with group-LASSO to reconstruct networks,\nand concluded that the choice of smoothing parameters for the data\nV\nC The Author(s) 2022.

Xue et al. (2018) proposed a two-step esti-\nmation and nonlinear independence screening method to implement\nvariable selection, where nonlinear ODE functions were considered.\nDespite the extensive development of ODE-based networking\nmethods, their practical applications to medical problems are very\nlimited because insufficient temporal or perturbed data are avail-\nable. For instance, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project\n(Consortium, 2015) collected gene expression from each tissue of\neach subject at a single-time data point, from which traditional\nODE approaches cannot be directly applied. To determine pseudo-\ndynamics from static snapshots, Chen et al. (2019, 2021) developed\nan interdisciplinary approach that could analyze steady-state data\nusing an ODE-like model. The central idea of the idopNetwork\nmodel was to define the so-called expression index (i.e. the total\namount of expression of all genes in individual samples) as a non-\ntime-based derivative of ODEs. Its key and required assumption was\nthat all genes acted together in a closed system that was independent\nof any extrinsic environment. However, the constructed index and\nthe resulting networks are not easy to interpret in practice. Also, it is\nhighly likely that the pattern and strength of gene interactions is\ninfluenced by aspects of the environment (e.g. disease risk; Sikkink\net al., 2019). Recovering from static data that how functional rela-\ntionships of genes vary with extrinsic factors can help better under-\nstand the connections between gene network behavior and certain\ndisease risk, which is lacking in both theory and applications.\nIn this work, we developed a general framework to recover dis-\nease risk-associated pseudo-dynamic networks, named ‘DRDNet’,\nfrom static data with the networks treated as an open system. We in-\nnovatively incorporated the varying coefficient models (VCMs) with\nmultiple sets of ODEs to explore how genes interact mutually as a\nfunction of a latent extrinsic factor (e.g. certain disease risk). This\nopen-system framework has several unique advantages compared to\nexisting methods: the potential to associate the mechanistic impact\nof gene coregulation with disease risk, the flexibility in adjusting for\nvarious covariates in gene networking and the sophistication to sim-\nultaneously recover multiple networks due to the effects of these\ncovariates (e.g. cigarette smoking). In addition, selection consistency\nwas rigorously explored in theory given some imputed disease risk\nunder the ultrahigh-dimensional context (large-p–small-n), which\nwas lacking in the literature. Extensive simulation studies were con-\nducted to evaluate the finite-sample behavior. To demonstrate its\npractical applications, we analyzed the publicly available GTEx\ndata in order to identify hypertension risk-associated gene expres-\nsion networks in coronary artery tissue. Two types of pseudo-\ndynamic networks were simultaneously recovered due to baseline\npopulation and smoking effect, and biological findings supported by\ngene enrichment analysis and existing literature showed that key\ngenes constituting these networks had pivotal and biologically rele-\nvant roles associated with the vascular system.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 The motivating data and method overview\nThe GTEx data (version 7.0) contained 979 donors in total, with\n291 samples from coronary artery tissue, and more than 50 thou-\nsand gene expression records for each donor from the GTEx consor-\ntium (Consortium et al., 2015, 2017). Although previous studies\nbegan to infer tissue-specific gene networks (Sonawane et al., 2017),\nnone of them took advantage of non-temporal data to identify dy-\nnamic networks, because the GTEx data collected from dying\ndonors only included a single-time measurement. Given that the cir-\nculatory architecture of blood vessels is strongly related to hyperten-\nsion (Folkow, 1987; Heagerty et al., 2010), the primary goal of this\nwork is to reconstruct gene networks specific to coronary artery tis-\nsue and show how the interbehaviors described by these networks\nare related to the progression of hypertension risk across subjects.\nFor the 291 donors sampled for gene expression in coronary artery\ntissue, their health status, demographic factors and lifestyles were\nalso recorded. The existing literature showed that cigarette smoking\ncould impair some functions of coronary arteries (Ambrose and\nBarua, 2004; Zeiher et al., 1995). Thus, we further investigate the\nnetwork behaviors resulting from the cigarette smoking effect.\nFigure 1 summarized the method overview of DRDNet. In gen-\neral, the training data include gene expression across multiple sub-\njects as well as clinical characteristics, such as disease status ~D of\nprimary interest and other covariates ~X. No temporal data are\nrequired. To recover pseudo-dynamic networks, DRDNet first sum-\nmarizes subject-level heterogeneity by an imputed agent evaluating\nthe risk of having certain disease, such as essential hypertension.\nThis can be done by applying supervised learning based on disease\nconditions on covariates. The recovered agent then serves a pseudo\ntimeline and is used to detect networks. By applying VCMs and mul-\ntiple sets of ODEs, DRDNet is able to simultaneously detect mul-\ntiple pseudo-dynamic networks associated with certain disease risk\nand predictors of interest. In the following subsections, we will ex-\nplicitly describe each step in DRDNet.\n2.2 The varying coefficient models\nThe DRDNet framework begins with the VCMs. Consider a system\nof p nodes (e.g. genes within the coronary artery tissue) that interact\nthrough a network. Note that p can be a function of the sample size\nn under the high-dimension setup. As indicated in previous sections,\nthis system is open to external factors (e.g. hypertension risk), where\nthere exists a specific agent (I) evaluated for each subject that can\naffect, or be affected by, the system. In general, let Yij be the out-\ncome (i.e. gene expression) and the ith subject for the jth node,\nfor\ni ¼ 1; . . . ; n\nand\nj ¼ 1; . . . ; p,\nwith\npotential\ncovariates\nZij ¼ ðZij1; . . . ; ZijRÞT. In order to systematically characterize func-\ntional relationships between the outcomes and the agent, we define\nthe following VCMs:\nFig. 1. A schematic workﬂow of DRDNet. Given disease conditions ~D and clinical characters ~X from each subject, DRDNet conducts supervised learning to impute disease\nrisk. The learning process heuristically incorporates VCM and multiple sets of ODEs to infer pseudo-dynamic networks. The ﬁnal output contains multiple networks associ-\nated with disease progression and some risk factor of primary interest\n2482\nC.Chen et al.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2481/6537533 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nYij ¼ XT\nij ljðIiÞ þ \u0002ij;\n(1)\nwhere\nXij ¼ ðXij0; . . . ; XijRÞT ¼ ð1; ZT\nij ÞT\nand\nljðIiÞ ¼\nðlj0ðIiÞ; . . . ; ljRðIiÞÞT is the unobserved and underlying dynamic fea-\nture vector corresponding to each covariate. Note that any (dynam-\nic) features in the remaining article would be referred to ljðIiÞ. The\nquantity \u0002ij is a random error, which is commonly assumed to be\nnormally distributed with mean zero and variance r2 > 0; however,\nthis assumption can be extended to the sub-Gaussian error case if\nnecessary (Chen et al., 2017). In model (1), the dynamic features\nljðIiÞ are allowed to vary smoothly with the agent Ii, and the covari-\nate effects can exhibit a changing pattern along with changes to the\nagent. In theory, the VCMs (1) have been well established in many\ndisciplines (Fan and Zhang, 2008). However, the VCMs only quan-\ntify the dynamic features independently for the jth univariate node,\nwhich in turn masks the underlying dependency among nodes in the\nsystem; thus, it fails to fully depict a scheme for the whole system.\nOur next goal is to understand how these dynamic features ljðIiÞ be-\nhave or functionally regulate each other as the agent Ii changes.\n2.3 The ODEs model\nTo better uncover the functional dynamic-relationships among the\nunderlying dynamic features, we embed multiple additive ODEs\nmodels into the VCMs in (1). To be specific, for j ¼ 1; . . . ; p and any\nprespecified agent I, the connection from all the nodes to the jth\nnode for the dynamic feature corresponding to the rth covariate ef-\nfect can be characterized by\nl0\njrðIÞ ¼ cjr þ\nX\np\nj0¼1\nfjj0rðlj0rðIÞÞ; r ¼ 0; . . . ; R;\n(2)\nwhere l0\njrðIÞ denotes the derivative of ljrðIÞ with respect to the agent\nI. We regard the relationship modeled by (2) as the network system.\nAs multiple sets of ODEs are applied to characterize the interbehav-\niors among dynamic features corresponding to each covariate, a var-\niety of informative networks could be inferred from the system; for\ninstance, the network corresponding to the system’s self-mechanism\nat the baseline or reference level, and those corresponding to differ-\nent covariate effects. Within each network, fjj0rð\u0002Þ is the function that\nquantifies the effect of the rth covariate on the edge from the j0th\nnode to the jth node. More specifically, the positive (negative) value\nfor fjj0rð\u0002Þ implies an enhancement (inhibition) effect, leading to\nsigned relationships between nodes. On the other hand, as the ODEs\nin (2) quantify the functional and determined relationships on the\nderivative scale between dynamic features ljrðIÞ, the edge effect\nwould be bidirectional, in contrast to networks obtained via statis-\ntical association.\nAccordingly, combining multiple sets of the ODE model with the\nVCMs can simultaneously uncover multiple networks encoding the\ndirection, sign and weight of every interaction between all nodes in\nthe system. Note that if there is no covariate involved, model (1) is\nreduced to the model with only a varying intercept; thus, it becomes\nthe model introduced by Henderson and Michailidis (2014), Wu\net al. (2014) and Chen et al. (2017) with a time sequence utilized as\nthe agent I, or it is reduced to the model proposed by Chen et al.\n(2019) with defined expression index as the agent I. Accordingly,\nour framework unifies and extends the model in a more general\nlearning framework for informative network reconstruction.\n2.4 Agent\nIn general, an environmental agent outside the gene system can be\ntime, a signal or another physical factor. In the existing literature,\ntime is the most commonly used agent for gene network reconstruc-\ntion (Chen et al., 2017; Henderson and Michailidis, 2014; Wu et al.,\n2014). In this case, repeated measurements for each type of out-\ncomes (nodes) are required, with a diagram of the data structure\nsuch as that displayed in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material.\nHowever, as indicated in Section 1, collecting longitudinal data\nfrom human tissues is often either impossible or ethically impermis-\nsible. Thus, how to use static-state data to unveil a pseudo-dynamic\nnetwork is our main challenge. The selection of the continuum agent\nI is also critical. In our GTEx application, one of the fundamental\nperspectives in reconstructing a network was to link the agent I to\nhypertension risk. It is known that hypertension progression can\ncause the ecosystem and architecture within the artery to change,\nresulting in genes being differently expressed and regulated (Folkow,\n1987). Therefore, to capture the ‘spectrum’ of hypertension risk, we\ncan use (but not limited to) subject-level fitted risk of having hyper-\ntension via logistic regression to recover the agent (Fig. 1). By adopt-\ning such an alternative imputed agent instead of a time sequence, the\ndata containing the outcomes (nodes) evaluated at different subjects\ncan be used, which changes the data structure that we need to re-\ncover pseudo-dynamic networks (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary\nMaterial). An alternative view of this imputed agent is that it can be\ndeemed as an integrative representation of heterogeneous data, simi-\nlar to the propensity score, which summarizes information from dis-\nease\nconditions\nand\nsubject-level\ncovariates\nin\na\nregression.\nAdopting such an agent into the system implicitly enables better ex-\nplanation of across-subjects heterogeneity. Therefore, with imputed\nagent, the VCMs in (1) together with the ODE model (2) could flex-\nibly reveal the underlying pseudo-dynamic network system along\nwith disease risk. More concrete example about the agent in our ap-\nplication are given in Section 4.\n2.5 Network interpretation\nOne direct interpretation is based on the ODE model in (2). The\n(non-zero) function fjj0rðIÞ describes an instantaneous rate of change\non the edge from the j0th node to the jth node due to the rth covari-\nate effect with respect to the agent evaluated at I. Thus, in our\nGTEx application, these microeffects together characterize the func-\ntional dynamic-interactions between genes in both smoking and\nnon-smoking groups and describe the system at a specific level of\nhypertension risk. On the other hand, if we integrate the ODEs in\n(2) to the original scale, i.e.\nljrðIÞ ¼ ajr þ cjrI þ\nX\np\nj0¼1\nðI\n0\nfjj0rðlj0rðuÞÞdu; r ¼ 0; . . . ; R;\n(3)\nthe integral term\nÐ I\n0 fjj0rðlj0rðuÞÞdu would be interpreted as the total\nrth covariate effect on the edge from the j0th node to the jth node\nwhen the agent changes from 0 to I. More generally, by integration\nin our GTEx application, we are able to depict the accumulated\nmacrointeractions changing between any two prespecified hyperten-\nsion risk levels, enabling us to systematically explore the aggregated\ninteractions and obtain information about the coregulation behav-\niors along with hypertension progression. Furthermore, by integrat-\ning the knowledge from evolutionary game theory (Chen et al.,\n2019), we define ajr þ cjrI as an endogenous component to explain\nthe self-regulation within the system, and the summation term in (3)\nas an accumulative exogenous component to describe the interaction\nbehaviors among the nodes. More details of the GTEx application\nare given in Section 4.\n2.6 Network learning\nFor illustration purpose, it is assumed that the agent I is known and\ngiven by some observed variable. In the case where the agent is un-\nobserved, an imputed agent is considered, which first needs to be fit-\nted based on supervised learning (e.g. a logistic regression model to\nimpute the risk of having hypertension). Refer to Section 2.4 for\nmore details. Then, the same learning procedure to that described\nbelow can be followed by replacing I with imputed agent ^I.\nFirst, we adopt a non-parametric technique based on basis\nexpansions to approximate fjj0rðlj0rðIÞÞ, e.g. BTðlj0rðIÞÞbjj0r with basis\nexpansion matrix Bð\u0002Þ and an unknown parameter vector bjj0r for\nr ¼ 0; . . . ; R (Chen et al., 2017, 2019; Henderson and Michailidis,\n2014; Wu et al., 2014). Here, bjj0r denotes as network parameters.\nNote that there is no edge effect from the j0th node to the jth node\nfrom the rth covariate if bjj0r ¼ 0. Second, the underlying features\nljrðIÞ are unobserved. Here, we adopt a two-step collocation pro-\ncedure to deal with this issue, as initially outlined by Varah (1982).\nRecovering dynamic networks from static data\n2483\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2481/6537533 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nIn particular, for each j and r, we first fit the smooth estimates\n^ljrðIÞ, such as the local polynomial regression estimators under the\nVCMs, and then construct the basis from those estimates ^ljrðIÞ, i.e.\nBTð^lj0rðIÞÞbjj0r of the B-spline as described above, to solve the param-\neters of interest. Third, the derivatives l0\njrðIÞ are unknown, and dir-\nectly solving the ODE model in (2) is computationally challenging.\nInstead, we consider integrating the model (2) to its original scale\n(Dattner and Klaassen, 2015), i.e. for j ¼ 1; . . . ; p,\nljrðIÞ ¼ ajr þ cjrI þ\nX\np\nj0¼1\nðI\n0\nBTð^lj0rðuÞÞbjj0rdu; r ¼ 0; . . . ; R:\n(4)\nNote that the ODE model in (2) is now transformed to the original\nscale in (4), which avoids the estimation of the derivatives. Last,\nwe apply the regularization technique of group-LASSO (Yuan and\nLin, 2006) for group-level variable selection, which can simultan-\neously penalize all the coefficients corresponding to the basis expan-\nsions for each node.

Finally, together with model (1), Equation (4),\nand the local polynomial kernel smoothing estimators ^ljrðIÞ with\norder l and their spline basis expansions, we estimate the overall net-\nwork\nparameters,\nbj,\nby\nsolving\nthe\nfollowing\noptimization\nproblem:\n^bj ¼ arg minaj;cj;bjj0r\n1\n2n\nX\nn\ni¼1\nYij\u0003XT\nij aj\u0003IiXT\nij cj\u0003\nX\nR\nr¼0\nX\np\nj0¼1\nXijr ~B\nT\nj0rðIiÞbjj0r\n8\n<\n:\n9\n=\n;\n2\nþkjn\nX\nR\nr¼0\nX\np\nj0¼1\n1\nn\nX\nn\ni¼1\nX2\nijrbT\njj0r ~Bj0rðIiÞ~B\nT\nj0rðIiÞbjj0r\n(\n)\n1\n2\n:\n(5)\nNote that ~Bj0rðIiÞ ¼ Ð Ii\n0 Bð^lj0rðuÞÞdu can be numerically calculated.\nFor j; j0 ¼ 1; . . . ; p and r ¼ 0; . . . ; R, we have\n^lj ¼ arg minljð\u0002Þ2§ðhjnÞ\nX\nn\ni¼1\nðYij \u0003 XT\nij ljðIi; hjnÞÞ2;\nwhere §ðhjnÞ is a non-parametric class of functions with a smoothing\nparameter hjn. The R package np is efficient to obtain the non-\nparametric estimates. Tuning parameters kjn and hjn can be selected\nby the cross-validation technique, which has to be shown similar to\nother techniques (Fig. S5). Note that those smoothing factors are\nnot required to be the same for each node. After obtaining ^lj and\n~Bj0rðIiÞ and then plugging them in (5), we are able to estimate net-\nwork parameters (i.e. ^bj) by applying the well-developed R packages\nof grpreg and spline2.\n2.7 Asymptotic property\nNow we establish the selection consistency for DRDNet. This theor-\netical property indicates that by applying DRDNet leads to accurate\nrecovery of the underlying true network structure with large prob-\nability. The main theorem, regularity conditions and technical\nproofs are present in Section A, B, C and D in the Supplementary\nMaterial. The proof is conducted where the agent I is unobserved\nand need to be imputed. The variability of estimated agent together\nwith the VCMs incorporated into the ODEs system make the proof\nunique and more subtle to those in the existing literature (Chen\net al., 2017; Henderson and Michailidis, 2014; Wu et al., 2014).\nNote that in the main theorem, we allow the number of nodes p\n(e.g. genes) large enough to be in exponential order of sample size n,\nthus the scenarios with ultrahigh dimension could be accommo-\ndated. More discussions about regularity conditions are referred to\nSection A in the Supplementary Material.\n3 Simulation studies\nIn this section, we describe extensive simulation studies to empirical-\nly evaluate our proposed framework under different setups. For all\ncases, each outcome (node) was generated over the true agent from\nthe interval ½0; 20\u0004. A numerical integration for the spline basis was\nalso conducted with a step size of 0.0001. The cross-validation tech-\nnique was used for bandwidth selection in kernel smoothing and the\ntuning parameter in group-LASSO in (5). To illustrate the applica-\ntion of our method and better present results, we first considered the\nsetup under relatively small number of nodes, along similar lines in\nthe existing literature (Chen et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2014). This phe-\nnomenon is also commonly encountered in applications of dynamic\nnetwork analysis because limited number of genes are retained after\nthe initial stage of dimensional reduction (Chen et al., 2017, 2019).\nNevertheless, more setups were evaluated at the end of this section.\nIn what follows, we demonstrated the numerical performance of our\nproposal in two cases: an observed random variable agent and an\nunobserved agent. In each scenario, two types of networks were con-\nstructed: one for the baseline network and the other one for the\ncovariate-effect-associated network. Note that existing methods\ncannot be directly applied to our context based on at least one of the\nfollowing three reasons: (i) requirement of time course data; (ii) in-\nability to adjust for other covariates in the modeling; (iii) inability to\ndiscover multiple networks due to covariate effects.\n3.1 Case one: observed random variable agent\nFirst, we generated a random variable as the agent I\n~l\nIi\n20\n\u0002\n\u0003\n¼ ~b0 þ ~xT\ni ~b;\n(6)\nwhere ~lðtÞ ¼ log ðt=ð1 \u0003 tÞÞ; and the covariates ~xi are i.i.d. following\na three-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with a mean\nvector of zeros and an identity covariance matrix. The parameters\nare ~b0 ¼ \u00030:5 and ~b ¼ ð\u00031; 1:5; \u00031ÞT. Thus, the generated agent I\nis spaced within the interval ½0; 20\u0004. For i ¼ 1; . . . ; n, we first consid-\nered a relatively small set of nodes including 11 active nodes and 10\nredundant nodes in the network system. Specific formulas for gener-\nating networks are referred to Section E of the Supplementary\nMaterial. Note that there are two networks in the system: one\nrelates to the baseline or reference-level feature outcomes, and the\nother corresponds to the covariate-effect. Two network structures\nwere visualized in Figs 2A and S3A in the Supplementary Material.\nWe considered a setup with different sample sizes (n ¼ 100, 200)\nand residual variances (r2 ¼ 0:1, 0.5) of generated outcomes.\nSummary statistics, including the true positive rate (TPR), the false\npositive rate (FPR) and mean-squared error (MSE), were recorded\nfor performance evaluation. We also separately displayed the results\nfor the baseline network and the covariate-induced network.\nFigures 2B and S3B in the Supplementary Material summarized\nthe performance for each active node for baseline network and\ncovariate-effect (Z-effect) network, respectively. To be specific, TPR\nfor a node indicates the selection rate for correctly detecting edges\nconnecting to that node, and FPR for a node thereby implies the se-\nlection rate for mis-detecting edges connecting to the node. On the\nother hand, MSE for a specific node indicates the discrepancy be-\ntween the underlying true features ljrðIÞ and the estimated features\n^ljrðIÞ from (5). As shown in both figures, the proposed method\nshowed satisfactory performance in detecting not only the baseline\nnetwork but also the network due to the covariate-effect (Z-effect).\nMoreover, better TPR and MSE values were observed as the sample\nsize or measurement precision was increased; however, the FPR was\nslightly improved, possibly owing to the use of the cross-validation\nand group-LASSO techniques and being observed in the work by\nWu et al. (2014) and Chen et al. (2017, 2019).\n3.2 Case two: unobserved and unevenly spaced agent\nIn this case, the underlying true agent was still generated from (6) in\nSection 3.1, but the agent was unobserved. The other setups were\nthe same as in Section 3.1. Here, we only observed the variable ~Di\nfollowed by a Bernoulli distribution with success probability of\nIi=20. Such a situation is more realistic in practice, for instance, in\ndisease risk-associated network detection, where the disease risk is\ntypically unobserved. In such a context, in order to implement our\n2484\nC.Chen et al.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2481/6537533 by guest on 23 October 2025\n\nlearning procedure, the imputed agent, such as predicted disease risk\n(probabilities), should be obtained first by fitting a logistic regres-\nsion to the data ~Di with covariates ~xi (Section 2.6). The results were\nsummarized in Figures 2C and S3C in the Supplementary Material.\nAgain, a satisfactory performance and similar patterns were\nobserved generally in this scenario. Besides, compared to the results\nin Section 3.1, the TPR and MSE were slightly worse in this case;\nthis is consistent with our expectation, as there are more uncertain-\nties involved in the learning process because of the imputation of the\nagent. Further, more evaluations, such as sensitivity analysis for tun-\ning parameters (Fig. S5), the cases with a normal distributed covari-\nates Zi (Tables S1 and S2) and the cases with a large number of\nnodes p ¼ 50, 100, 200 (Tables S3 and S4), were provided in the\nSupplementary Material, which showed similar patterns and satis-\nfactory results.\n4 Application to the GTEx data\nAs a proof of concept, we used the DRDNet to analyze GTEx data.\nAs indicated in Section 2.1, the main purpose was to investigate\ngene networks associated with the progression of hypertension\nbased on (but not limited to) coronary artery tissue-specific expres-\nsion. The secondary goal was to detect extra-network behaviors due\nto the smoking effect, compared with the non-smoking group. We\nperformed data cleaning by excluding low-expressed genes with\nvalue <1 and taking log-transformation for normalized expression\nvalues to relieve skewness and reduce variance.\nIn order to obtain an agent to properly predict hypertension risk,\nwe formulated a logistic regression model to predict the probability\nof having hypertension based on a joint effect of age, sex, height,\nbody mass index, drinking status and comorbidities due to asthma,\nchronic respiratory disease, heart attack, ischemic heart disease, dia-\nbetes mellitus type I and diabetes mellitus type II. To construct the\ndynamic networks based on (1) and (2), only genes showing chang-\ning expression patterns as the agent changes should be included,\nwhich is different from association-based network. To fulfill this\ngoal, we combined two selection processes: (i) to test differentially\nexpressed genes and (ii) to filter genes based on screening. For the\nformer process, we applied t-test to locate genes showing group dif-\nference between healthy group and hypertension group by applying\nHochberg multiple test adjustment (adjusted P-value <0.05). For\nthe latter process, we calculated Spearman’s rank correlations be-\ntween genes and the imputed agent to screen the high-dimensional\ngenes stratified by smoking status, and picked the first 40 most cor-\nrelated genes for each group (smoking or not). Genes were finally\ncombined based on two selection procedures. This led to a total of\n85 genes, which was allowed by the sparsity assumption asserted in\nDunbar’s law for genetic network studies (Dunbar, 1992). This set\nof genes were detected statistically over-represented and significant-\nly associated with mRNA editing complex GO term and unclassified\nterms in biological process, cellular component and molecular func-\ntion categories.\nThereafter, we incorporated an intercept and cigarette smoking\nas a covariate into the model (1). By doing so, we could not only ob-\nserve how the genes interacted in the non-smoking population, but\nalso detect whether smoking would alter certain gene behaviors\nwithin the environment of the coronary artery tissue. Note that the\nagent was imputed by integrating other individual-level covariates\ninformation and thus was able to account for heterogeneity across\nsubjects (Section 2.4). Thereby, the use of imputed agent highlights\nadvantages of our proposed learning framework to account for data\nheterogeneity. Finally, we applied the learning procedure of the\nDRDNet model introduced in Section 2.6 to reconstruct the net-\nwork. The overall procedure followed the workflow in Figure 1.\nFirst, we visualized expression trajectories of all selected genes\nacross\nthe\nimputed\nhypertension\nrisk\nin\nFigure\nS4\nin\nthe\nSupplementary Material; these were stratified by cigarette smoking\nstatus. Clear nonlinear increasing or decreasing trends for the ex-\npression of these genes were observed, which might imply the exist-\nence of interaction behaviors among those genes, as hypertension\nprogressed. For instance, the FMNL3 and GLRB genes showed\nincreased expression with increased hypertension risk, whereas\nTOX2 and CBLL1 showed decreased expression. There was a mild\ndifference observed between the smoking and non-smoking groups.\nThe reconstructed networks that were dynamically varying along\nwith changes of an individual’s hypertension risk were displayed in\nFigure 3. To see changing patterns, we plotted six networks that\ncould be interpreted as the accumulated interbehaviors introduced\nin Section 2.5 as an individual’s hypertension risk changed from\nnone to high level. The upper three networks in Figure 3 described\ngene–gene interactions for the population without smoking, whereas\nthe bottom three summarized additional gene interactions subject to\nsmoking effect. To better present the network, we eliminated some\nedges with very small values (<0.03). For the population of non-\nsmokers, three hub genes were detected, i.e. WNK, RCN3 and\nC6orf46, which played important roles in network structures all the\ntime from low level to high level of hypertension risk. As hyperten-\nsion risk increased, more genes interacted with each other with\nheavier edges, thus leading increasingly complicated network struc-\ntures and more gene–gene interbehaviors. More hub genes were\ndetected, such as NDUFA4L2 and TSPO, when hypertension risk\nbecame moderate or high. Note that genes like WNK, NDUFA4L2\nand TSPO were shown associated with biological processes of vas-\ncular remodeling and blood pressure regulation in previous studies\n(Liu et al., 2021; Murthy et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2012). Our findings\nin this paper provided clear and informative patterns of gene–gene\nbehaviors caused by hypertension progression and unveil how im-\nportant genes dynamically regulate others as hypertension risk\nincreased. In addition, there were slight gene–gene effects caused by\ncigarette smoking, compared to the networks from non-smoker\npopulation (Fig. 3). This indicates that two populations (with or\nwithout smoking) may have similar gene–gene interaction behaviors\nFig. 2. 1000 Monte Carlo data under four combinations of sample size n (100 or 200) and residual variance r2 (v1 indicates r2 ¼ 0:1; v5 indicates r2 ¼ 0:5).

In summary, the above findings pro-\nvided more concrete and quantitative evidence to show whether and\nhow hypertension progression leads to alterations in gene interac-\ntions in the coronary arteries.\n5 Discussion\nThe DRDNet breaks with the traditional perspective on dynamic\nnetworks. For method point of view, we have successfully incorpo-\nrated the VCMs with multiple sets of ODEs to systematically study\nthe interactions among various outcomes and heuristically inferred\ndisease risk-associated pseudo-dynamic gene networks from static\ndata, which are lacking in existing literature. The selection consist-\nency property with imputed agent has been theoretically investi-\ngated, which is more technical and subtle compared to the existing\ntheory (Chen et al., 2017; Henderson and Michailidis, 2014; Wu\net al., 2014). Also, DRDNet can be conveniently implemented and\nembedded into well-developed R packages. This unified framework\nmay have widespread uses in practice because it does not rely on\ntemporal data. Its application to analysis of GTEx data also pro-\nvides unique insight into the relationship between gene coregulation\nand hypertension with changing risk. Predominant hub genes in the\nnetworks have been successfully annotated based on a detailed bio-\ninformatics analysis. As a data-driven approach, the DRDNet has\ndemonstrated its power and potential to explain complex systems.\nDespite its novelty, there are some limitations of DRDNet in the\nwarranty for further extensions. The current proposal used group-\nLASSO, which might not hold the oracle property in theory. More\nadvanced techniques, such as adaptive group-LASSO (Wu et al.,\n2014), could be used to reduce false positives. Also, this article pro-\nvided a workable way by using logistic regressions to model the dis-\nease status as illustrated in the data application. Other alternatives\nsuch as machine learning tools could be considered. In addition, it is\nstill cautious to make any solid biological conclusion, and further\nverification is necessary. Many complex diseases, such as hyperten-\nsion, is polygenic and relevant to multiple tissues and organs, thus\nintegration of multitissue gene expression network is necessary for\nexploration. Our proposed learning procedure owning the benefits\nfor inferring disease risk-associated pseudo-dynamic gene networks\ncould be generalized for such applications in future studies. Note\nthat DRDNet has builds functional relationship among dynamic\nmeans of genes, which is different from association-based network\n(Fujita et al., 2007; Yuan and Lin, 2007). How to construct\nassociation-based pseudo-dynamic network given static data is open\nto research.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author Wu’s work was partially supported by Grant U01 HL119178\nfrom\nthe\nNational\nHeart,\nLung\nand\nBlood\nInstitute\n(NHLBI)\nand\n5R01HD086911-02 from National Institute of Child Health and Human\nDevelopment (NICHD), the National Institute of Health; Wang’s research\nwas partially supported by Grant KL2 TR000126 and TR002015 from the\nNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

Snow1,2, Tingting Yao1, and Robert E. Cohen1\nHistone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are dynamic, context-dependent signals that modulate chromatin structure\nand function. Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation to different lysines of histones H2A and H2B is used to regulate diverse processes such\nas gene silencing, transcriptional elongation, and DNA repair. Despite considerable progress made to elucidate the players\nand mechanisms involved in histone ubiquitination, there remains a lack of tools to monitor these PTMs, especially in live\ncells. To address this, we combined an avidity-based strategy with in silico approaches to design sensors for specifically\nubiquitinated nucleosomes. By linking Ub-binding domains to nucleosome-binding peptides, we engineered proteins that\ntarget H2AK13/15Ub and H2BK120Ub with Kd values from 10−8 to 10−6 M; when fused to fluorescent proteins, they work as\nPTM sensors in cells. The H2AK13/15Ub-specific sensor, employed to monitor signaling from endogenous DNA damage through\nthe cell cycle, identified and differentiated roles for 53BP1 and BARD1 as mediators of this histone PTM.\nIntroduction\nMuch of biomedical research depends on reagents able to bind\nproteins with high affinity, specificity, and reproducibility.\nAntibodies and their derivatives, by far, have filled most of these\nneeds, but deficiencies regarding antibody availability, perfor-\nmance, or suitability have created a critical need for alternatives\n(Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015). In particular, for use as live-\ncell probes, misfolding and instability of conventional antibodies\nare major problems. As one alternative, fluorescently labeled\nantibody fragments made in vitro can be introduced into\nmammalian cells via transient membrane disruption, but these\nfluorescently labeled antibody fragments typically have low\naffinity for their targets, and suitability for use in live cells\nmust be determined empirically (Hayashi-Takanaka et al., 2011;\nStasevich et al., 2014). Other antibody derivatives and mimetics,\nsuch as single-chain variable fragment proteins, aptamers, De-\nsigned Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins), and Affimers, rely\non selection from large libraries followed by iterations of mu-\ntagenesis and screening to identify desirable variants (Azhar\net al., 2017; Crivianu-Gaita and Thompson, 2016; Ruigrok et al.,\n2011; Simeon and Chen, 2018). As an alternative route to develop\nbinding proteins for use as live-cell probes, in this study we have\nexploited avidity-based recognition to design genetically en-\ncoded sensors specific for ubiquitinated (Ub) nucleosomes. The\nlongstanding difficulties to generate antibodies to detect site-\nspecific protein ubiquitination (van Kruijsbergen et al., 2020)\nmake Ub–nucleosomes especially attractive molecular targets\nfor this proof-of-concept evaluation. To our knowledge, no\nsensors able to monitor protein ubiquitination in live cells have\nbeen reported previously.\nUb functions as a protein posttranslational modification\n(PTM) that signals a large variety of downstream events\n(Komander and Rape, 2012; Swatek and Komander, 2016). His-\ntones in nucleosomes are among the most abundant Ub sub-\nstrates, with the consequences depending on both the type of\nhistone and the lysine residue that is modified. For example, Ub\nattachment to histone H2A at Lys119 (H2AK119Ub) or H2B at\nLys120 (H2BK120Ub) installs Ub at opposite ends of a nucleo-\nsome where it promotes transcriptional silencing or activation,\nrespectively (Cao and Yan, 2012; de Napoles et al., 2004; Fang\net al., 2004; Minsky et al., 2008). In contrast, N-terminal\nubiquitination of H2A at K13 or K15 (H2AK13/15Ub) is a key\nsignal in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (Mattiroli et al.,\n2012). In addition, BRCA1-BARD1 acts as an E3 ligase to form\nH2AK125/127/129Ub (Kalb et al., 2014), which has been sug-\ngested to play a role in DSB repair pathway choice (Densham\net al., 2016; Uckelmann et al., 2018). Defects in enzymes that\neither assemble or disassemble these histone ubiquitination\nsignals (e.g., RNF168, polycomb, BRCA1, USP22, and BAP1) are\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO;\n2Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Colorado State\nUniversity, Fort Collins, CO.\nCorrespondence to Robert E.

Although\nmany proteins have been identified that regulate histone ubiq-\nuitination, including, in the parlance of the chromatin field,\nwriters, erasers, and readers, it has been difficult to establish the\norder and kinetics of their actions because tools to monitor\nPTMs directly have been lacking. We show here how well-\ncharacterized binding modules can be developed into avidity-\nbased sensors for Ub–nucleosomes, and that the sensors can be\nused to study site-specific histone ubiquitination associated with\ntranscription and DNA repair pathways. With one of the sen-\nsors, we show that the H2BK120Ub mark is lost upon inhibition\nof transcription by RNA polymerase II; with another, we con-\nfirm that H2AK13/15Ub is made at sites of DNA damage and\nshow that sensor recruitment is coincident with recruitment of\n53BP1. Unexpectedly, we also found that, even without exoge-\nnous DNA-damaging agents, H2AK13/15Ub foci are routinely\nobserved. We show that 53BP1 and BARD1 are likely the major\neffectors of H2AK13/15Ub in vivo, with 53BP1 dominating in G1\nphase and BARD1 in G2 phase of the cell cycle. These findings\nsupport recent revelations that H2AK13/15Ub is an important\nsignal during DNA replication (Schmid et al., 2018), and BARD1\nis potentially a regulator of that signal (Becker et al., 2020).\nResults\nAn avidity-based approach to design sensors targeting\nUb–nucleosomes\nAn avidity-based strategy was developed to generate sensors\nspecific for Ub–nucleosomes. Ub-binding domains (UBDs) were\nconnected by peptide linkers of varying lengths and rigidity to\nanchor domains that recognize the nucleosome acidic patch\n(Fig. 1, A and B). Anchors and UBDs were selected based on\npublished structures and on the binding orientations and af-\nfinities (dissociation constant [Kd] = 10−6 to 10−3 M) with their\nrespective targets. Linkers were designed to promote avidity by\nreducing the entropic cost of binding. Two viral peptides in-\nteracting with the nucleosome acidic patch, LANA (from the\nlatency-associated nuclear antigen; Barbera et al., 2006) and IE1\n(from the cytomegalovirus immediate-early protein 1; Fang\net al., 2016), were chosen as anchors for the first generation of\nUb–nucleosome sensors. Both peptides contain a conserved ar-\nginine residue (i.e., LANA R9 and IE1 R486) that contacts a\nsurface formed by H2A residues E61, D90, and E92. When bound\nto the acidic patch, LANA assumes a hairpin-like turn with its N-\nand C-termini pointing to the H2A N-terminal and H2B\nC-terminal tails, whereas IE1 N- and C-termini face the opposite\ndirection (Fig. 1, A and B). For the UBDs, we used either the\nengineered fusion protein tSR (Choi et al., 2019b) or the\nubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain from ubiquilin-1 (UBQ1UBA;\nFig. 1 B; Zhang et al., 2008). Because most naturally occurring\nUBDs bind Ub with low affinity, we previously developed tSR,\nwhich combines S5aUIM and Rabex5Ruz domains, to target both\nthe Ub hydrophobic patch surrounding residue I44 and the\nsurface surrounding residue D58; tSR has a Kd of 4 µM for\nmonoubiquitin (Choi et al., 2019b). UBQ1UBA, which binds to the\nUb hydrophobic patch, has a Kd of 22 µM for monoubiquitin\n(Zhang et al., 2008).\nAs proof of concept, we applied a structure-guided approach\nto design sensors targeting H2AK13/15Ub- or H2BK120Ub–\nnucleosomes. The prototypes, hereafter called Reader1.0 and\nReader1.1, contained LANA and tSR linked by an antiparallel\nα-helical coiled-coil (Hadley et al., 2008). Here, the coiled-coil\nlinker was chosen to limit the conformational mobility of the\nUb–nucleosome sensors in an attempt to promote preferential\nbinding to either H2AK13/15Ub or H2K120Ub. Reader1.0 has\nthree additional glycines inserted between LANA and two seg-\nments of the linker to increase flexibility (Fig. 1 C and Fig. S1).\nTo measure the affinities of the sensors for different Ub–\nnucleosomes, Reader1.0/1.1 were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488\n(Fig. S2 E) and titrated with reconstituted nucleosomes con-\ntaining nonhydrolyzable H2AK13Ub, H2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub,\nH2AK129Ub, or H2BK120Ub histone mimics (Fig. 1 D; and Fig. S2,\nA and C; Long et al., 2014). Reader1.0 showed high affinity for\nH2AK13Ub (Kd = 5 nM), H2AK15Ub (Kd = 12 nM), and\nH2BK120Ub (Kd = 21 nM), and 7- to 81-fold selectivity over\nH2AK119Ub (Kd = 405 nM) and H2AK129Ub (Kd = 141 nM).\nReader1.1 had a similar selectivity profile but with slightly lower\naffinities (Fig. 1, E and F). Because native chromatin contains\narrays of nucleosomes repeated along the DNA, we also assayed\nbinding with tri-nucleosome arrays (Winkler et al., 2011) con-\ntaining H2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub, or H2BK120Ub (Fig. S2, B and\nD). The designed sensors showed similar affinities and se-\nlectivities with the Ub-modified tri-nucleosome arrays as with\nthe mono-nucleosomes (Fig. S2 G), thereby validating our design\nprinciple.\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ub–nucleosomes\nguided the design of H2BK120Ub-selective sensors\nThe Ub C-terminal tail is highly flexible. In combination with all\nrotamers of the substrate Lys side chain modified by Ub, this tail\nallows Ub protein conjugates to sample a very large conforma-\ntional space. Therefore, to guide the design of sensors with\nbetter selectivity profiles, we conducted MD simulations to\nidentify conformations adopted by Ub when covalently attached\nto either H2AK15 or H2BK120 in nucleosomes. Despite the wide\nuse of MD to examine the flexibility of proteins and nucleic\nacids, application of MD is often limited by the size of the con-\nformational space and the complexity of the free energy land-\nscapes of macromolecules. An approach to overcome sampling\nlimitations is the analysis of an ensemble of multiple indepen-\ndent MD simulations done at high virtual temperatures (Day and\nDaggett, 2005a; Day and Daggett, 2005b). Here, we used all-\natom MD simulations to study minimal systems extracted\nfrom 3D nucleosome structures available from the Protein Data\nBank (Morgan et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016); specifically, one\ncopy of the H2A/H2BK120Ub or H2AK15Ub/H2B dimer with the\nsurrounding DNA double helix was employed (Fig. 2 A); a su-\nperposition algorithm then docked selected anchors and UBDs\ninto the aligned MD snapshots. After discarding conformations\nwhere anchor or UBD docking led to steric clashes, we observed\nthat, whereas 70–96% of the H2AK15Ub and H2BK120Ub con-\nformation snapshots could bind to either the LANA or IE1\ndos Santos Passos et al.\nJournal of Cell Biology\n2 of 20\nLive-cell sensors for ubiquitinated nucleosomes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911130\nDownloaded from http://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/220/4/e201911130/1818718/jcb_201911130.pdf by Bio-protocol user on 23 October 2025\n\nanchors, only 5% of the H2AK15Ub conformers showed si-\nmultaneous nucleosome acidic patch accessibility to IE1 and\nUb accessibility to UBQ1UBA. On the other hand, 50% of the\nH2BK120Ub conformations showed accessibility to both do-\nmains (Fig. 2, B and C). For the subset of conformations si-\nmultaneously accessible to IE1 and UBQ1UBA, we measured the\ndistances separating H2AE61 from UbI44 and found that the\nallowable H2BK120Ub and H2AK15Ub conformations showed\ndistinct distributions (Fig. 2 D). In particular, for H2AE61 to\nUbI44 distances of 30–35\n˚A, accessible H2BK120Ub con-\nformations did not overlap with those of H2AK15Ub. This\nprediction allowed us to design H2BK120Ub-specific sensors in\nwhich IE1 was linked directly to UBQ1UBA (Reader2.0) or UB-\nQ1UBA-A556E (Reader2.1). The A556E mutation was made to in-\ncrease the UBD•Ub affinity threefold (Kd = 7.4 µM; Fig. 2 E and\nFig. S1; Choi et al., 2019b).\nIn vitro characterization of Reader2.0 and Reader2.1 em-\nployed competition assays with either Alexa Fluor 488–labeled\nReader1.0\n(for\nH2AK15Ub\nand\nH2BK120Ub)\nor\na\npan-\nUb–nucleosome\nsensor\n(for\nH2AK119Ub\nand\nH2AK129Ub;\nFig. 2 F; and Fig. S2, E and F).

In comparison, Reader2.0 has a Ki of 144 nM for\nH2BK120Ub and, respectively, 9- and 18-fold selectivity over\nH2AK15Ub and H2AK119Ub (Fig. 2, G and H).\nReader2.0/2.1 are reporters for H2BK120Ub in human\nosteosarcoma (U-2 OS) cells\nTo evaluate if the sensors can report chromatin ubiquitination\nin vivo, we expressed them as eGFP fusions in mammalian cells\n(Fig. S1). First, U-2 OS cells were transiently transfected with\nplasmids encoding NLS-Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP and immunostained\nwith an anti-H2BK120Ub antibody. Unexpectedly, cells expressing\nhigh levels of Reader2.0 or Reader2.1 showed increases in\nH2BK120Ub (Fig. S3, A and B) with a positive correlation be-\ntween H2BK120Ub levels and Reader2.0/2.1 signals (Fig. S3, D\nand E). These effects were most likely caused by Reader2.0/2.1\nbinding to H2BK120Ub and protecting it from deubiquitinat-\ning enzymes (DUBs) that otherwise would remove the PTM\n(Atanassov et al., 2016; Henry et al., 2003; Samara et al., 2010).\nUnlike Reader2.0/2.1, overexpression of Reader1.0 did not affect\nH2BK120Ub levels in U-2 OS cells (Fig. S3, A–C).\nIn the absence of DNA damage, Ub–nucleosomes pre-\ndominantly contain H2AK119Ub or H2BK120Ub (Weake and\nWorkman, 2008). We investigated if Reader1.0/2.0/2.1 recog-\nnize these nucleosomes in live cells. Guided by the measure-\nments of H2BK120Ub in U-2 OS cells expressing different levels\nof the sensors (Fig. S3, A and B), we analyzed cells expressing\nReader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP at relatively low levels (i.e., 500–10,000\nmean fluorescence intensity [MFI]) in order to minimize po-\ntential interferences with endogenous signaling events (Fig.\nS3 F). FRAP measurements in the nucleus were used to deter-\nmine the kinetics of sensor diffusion and binding to chromatin\n(Fig. S3 G). To evaluate the individual contributions of anchor\nand UBD, we also introduced mutations to abrogate the function\nof each domain. For clarity, the mutants were named based on\nwhich domain remains functional: mutants lacking anchor-\nnucleosome interaction are denoted as R1.0/2.1-UBD, mutants\nlacking UBD-Ub interactions are denoted as R1.0/2.1-anchor, and\nmutants lacking both the anchor-nucleosome and the UBD-Ub\ninteractions are denoted as nonbinding (R1.0/2.1-NB; Fig. 3 A and\nFig. S3 F).\nBased on FRAP recovery half-lives, we categorized two types\nof binding behavior. First, R1.0/2.1-UBD and R1.0/2.1-NB have\nsimilarly fast FRAP recoveries (t1/2 < 1.0 s), indicating that the\nUBD alone does not contribute significantly to the nuclear mo-\nbility of the sensors (Fig. 3, C, E, and F; and Table 1). This is not\nsurprising given that tSR and UBQ1UBA bind Ub with modest\naffinities and that competition by unconjugated Ub, which is\nabundant and distributed throughout the nucleus under basal\nconditions (Choi et al., 2019a; Clague et al., 2015), will reduce\nUb–nucleosome binding even further. Second, FRAP behavior of\nthe R1.0/2.1-Anchor mutants showed at least two components,\nwith 20–30% of the population bound to chromatin (LANA t1/2 =\n10.2 ± 7.8 s; IE1 t1/2 = 10.2 ± 6.6 s) and the rest freely diffused\n(Fig. 3, D–F; and Table 1). FRAP of the three readers showed\ndifferent combinations of fast and slow components. Compari-\nson of the half-lives together with the fractions estimated for the\nfast and slow components indicates that Reader2.0/2.1 interact\nmore tightly with chromatin than the IE1 anchor alone. The\nslower rates (Reader2.0 t1/2 = 20.2 ± 6.8 s; Reader2.1 t1/2 = 31.6 ±\n6.1 s) and the large fractions of the slow components (57% and\n74%, respectively) suggest avid binding to Ub–nucleosomes. In\ncontrast, Reader1.0 and Reader1.0-Anchor had similar mobilities\n(Fig. 3, D–F; and Table 1). Thus, in live cells, neither H2AK119Ub\nnor H2BK120Ub recruits Reader1.0 to nucleosomes.\nTo validate the specificities of the Readers with Ub–nucleosomes,\nwe performed FRAP measurements after cells were treated\nwith flavopiridol (FVP) or compound 1 (C1). FVP potently in-\nhibits phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal\ndomain in transcriptionally active chromatin and is required\nto maintain H2BK120Ub (Pirngruber et al., 2009); C1 inhibits\nthe E1 Ub-activating enzyme (Chen et al., 2011), thereby\nblocking all protein ubiquitination. Western blot analysis of\ncell lysates confirmed that, as expected, FVP reduced H2BK120Ub\nwithout affecting H2AK119Ub (Fig. 3 B), whereas C1 depleted\nboth H2BK120Ub and H2AK119Ub (Fig. 3 B). In C1-treated\ncells, Reader1.0/2.0/2.1 showed FRAP behavior similar to the\nR1.0/2.1-Anchor (Fig. 3, D and E; and Table 1). For Reader2.0/\n2.1, FVP treatment increased Reader2.0/2.1 nuclear mobilities\noverall (Fig. 3 D and Table 1) and markedly decreased the slow\ncomponent (Fig. 3 E and Table 1), suggesting that those sen-\nsors bind predominantly to H2BK120Ub in vivo. However,\ndifferences observed between the treatments with C1 and FVP\nsuggest that there are minor albeit detectable off-target in-\nteractions with chromatin, possibly due to Reader2.0/2.1 binding\nto H2AK119Ub. Note that although Reader2.1 has higher affinity\nthan Reader2.0 to H2BK120Ub, it is not more selective (Fig. 3 D\nand Table 1). For Reader1.0, FRAP was slightly affected by C1\ntreatment and unaffected by FVP, suggesting that, although\nReader1.0 might weakly interact with unknown Ub species in\nchromatin, interactions with H2BK120Ub were negligible (Fig. 3,\nD–F; and Table 1). Taken together, our results suggest that, in\ncells, Reader2.0/2.1 are selective for H2BK120Ub, whereas nei-\nther H2BK120Ub nor H2AK119Ub is reported by Reader1.0.\nReader1.0 is recruited to DNA DSBs by RNF168-dependent\nH2AK13/15 ubiquitination\nUbiquitination of H2AK13/15 by RNF168 is a DNA damage-\ninduced histone PTM that occurs downstream of phosphoryla-\ntion of H2AX by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase\n(Mattiroli et al., 2012). We used laser microirradiation to damage\nDNA in nuclei of U-2 OS cells stably expressing Reader1.0/2.0/\n2.1-eGFP under the control of doxycycline (Dox)-inducible pro-\nmoters. Reader1.0 was efficiently recruited to DNA lesions\nwhere, on average, sensor fluorescence increased 3.5-fold in\n15 min after microirradiation (Fig. 4, A and B). This accumula-\ntion of Reader1.0 at the DNA damage tracks was abolished in\ncells transfected with RNF168 siRNA (Fig. 4 A), indicating that\nReader1.0 recognizes the H2AK13/15Ub signal generated by this\nE3 ligase. FRAP measurements revealed that Reader1.0 has a\nslower average mobility at the DNA DSBs (slow t1/2 of 15.1 ± 2.9 s\naccounts for 83.6% of the recovery) than in undamaged regions\nof the nucleus (slow t1/2 of 4.5 ± 9.8 s accounts for 30.4%; Fig. 4 C\nand Table 1).

In contrast, Reader2.0/2.1 ac-\ncumulated far less at laser-induced DSBs (Fig. 4, A and B). As\nwith Reader1.0, the Reader2.0/2.1 recruitment was absent in\ncells transfected with siRNF168 (Fig. 4 A). Thus, despite selec-\ntivity for H2BK120Ub in undamaged chromatin, Reader2.0/2.1\ncan interact with other types of Ub–nucleosomes if they are at\nhigh local concentrations.\nReader1.0 competes with 53BP1 for binding to H2AK13/15Ub\nat DSBs\nThe H2AK13/15Ub epigenetic mark formed by RNF168 is needed\nto recruit downstream repair factors of which 53BP1 is best\nunderstood; 53BP1 has been used as a surrogate for detection of\nthe H2AK15Ub signal (Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013). To investi-\ngate the predicted competition between Reader1.0 and 53BP1 for\nbinding to sites of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination,\nwe coexpressed Reader1.0-eGFP and the minimal focus-forming\nregion (FFR) of 53BP1 (53BP1-FFR) fused to mCherry (Fradet-\nTurcotte et al., 2013) in U-2 OS cells (Fig. 5 A). Reader1.0 and\n53BP1-FFR colocalized to laser-induced DNA lesions with similar\nkinetics (Fig. 5, B and D); the inverse correlation between the\nfluorescence intensities of 53BP1-FFR at the DNA lesions and\nReader1.0 expression levels suggests that the sensor competes\nwith 53BP1 for H2AK13/15Ub (Fig. 5, B and C). Increases of 1.5,\n1.7, and 4.5-fold in 53BP1-FFR FRAP recovery rates were ob-\nserved for cells in which Reader1.0 was expressed at low, me-\ndium, and high levels, respectively (Fig. 5 E). With high\nReader1.0 expression, recruitment of 53BP1-FFR to laser-\ninduced DSBs was greatly reduced, and 53BP1-FFR FRAP mobi-\nlities in damaged and undamaged regions of the nuclei were\nnearly identical (Fig. 5 E).\nThese results highlight the potential for competition between\nendogenous DNA repair machinery and Reader1.0 and the im-\nportance of controlling sensor expression levels. Therefore, we\nsought to determine if low Reader1.0 expression affects the re-\npair process in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). For this\npurpose, we assessed the kinetics of phosphorylated his-\ntone H2AX (γH2AX) focus dissolution in U-2 OS cells stably\nexpressing Dox-inducible Reader1.0-eGFP. Control cells with\nsensor expression repressed (i.e., no Dox) and Reader1.0-ex-\npressing cells showed similar repair kinetics characterized by\nmaximal γH2AX focal accumulation 2 h after IR and recovery to\npreirradiation levels after 24 h (Fig. 5, F and G). Thus, despite\ndetectable competition with effectors of DNA repair, Reader1.0\ncan be used to monitor DNA damage–associated signaling\nwithout significant interference with the repair process.\nTable 1.\nSummary of fits for Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP in the nucleoplasm and Reader1.0-eGFP in the nucleoplasm and at laser-induced DSBs\nFRAP t1/2 (s)f\nKinetic\ncomponent\nNB\nUBD\nAnchor\nReader\nReader + FVP\nReader + C1\nReader1.0\nNucleoplasma\nFast\n0.6 ± 0.3 (100%)c 0.7 ± 0.4 (100%)c 0.7 ± 0.3 (80.5%)d\n1.1 ± 0.5 (72.6%)d\n0.9 ± 0.5 (68.4%)d\n0.8 ± 0.4 (79.1%)d\nSlow\n10.2 ± 7.8 (19.5%)d 11.0 ± 7.2 (27.4%)d\n6.5 ± 4.0 (31.6%)d\n8.3 ± 7.2 (20.9%)d\nReader2.0\nNucleoplasma\nFast\n1.9 ± 1.2 (43.1%)d\n1.6 ± 0.9 (60.8%)d\n1.5 ± 0.5 (74.9%)d\nSlow\n20.2 ± 6.8 (56.9%)d 11.0 ± 5.9 (39.2%)d 14.6 ± 9.5 (25.1%)d\nReader2.1\nNucleoplasma\nFast\n0.7 ± 0.4 (100%)c 0.6 ± 0.3 (100%)c 1.4 ± 0.7 (69.3%)d\n1.3 ± 0.9 (26.1%)d\n1.5 ± 0.6 (59.2%)d\n1.2 ± 0.5 (74.3%)d\nSlow\n10.2 ± 6.6 (30.7%)d 31.6 ± 6.1 (73.9%)d\n15.9 ± 5.5 (40.8%)d 10.6 ± 6.9 (25.7%)d\nReader1.0\nNucleoplasmb\nFast\n0.6 ± 1.2 (69.6%)e\nSlow\n4.5 ± 9.8 (30.4%)e\nReader1.0 DSBsb\nFast\n0.9 ± 1.7 (16.4%)e\nSlow\n15.1 ± 2.9 (83.6%)e\naFRAP of Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP transiently transfected in U-2 OS cells; n ≥6 cells per condition (two to five measurements per cell); photobleaching of\ncircular ROIs in the nucleus (diameter = 30 pixels; 1 pixel = 0.09 × 0.09 µm).\nbFRAP of Reader1.0-eGFP stably expressed in U-2 OS cells; n = 6 cells (two measurements per cell in both the nucleoplasm and at laser-induced DSBs);\nrectangular ROI (0.75 µm2).

RNF168 depletion largely abrogated these\nReader1.0 foci (Fig. S4, B and C); thus, the sensor could be de-\ntecting H2AK13/15Ub formed at transiently stalled DNA repli-\ncation forks (Schmid et al., 2018). To investigate how these\nH2AK13/15Ub signals may be regulated across the cell cycle, we\ngenerated a stable U-2 OS cell line in which Dox-inducible\nReader1.0-eGFP was coexpressed with the cell cycle reporter\nPCNA-interacting\nprotein\n(PIP)–fluorescent\nubiquitination-\nbased cell cycle indicator (FUCCI; Grant et al., 2018). In these\nlive-cell experiments, Reader1.0 was used to detect nuclear foci\nenriched in H2AK13/15Ub while the cell cycle phases were\nidentified based on the levels of fluorescently tagged PIP degron\n(Cdt11-17-iRFP682) and Geminin (mCherry-Geminin1-110; Fig. 6, A\nand B). To elucidate which DNA repair factors are involved in\nbasal signaling (i.e., without exogenous DNA damage agents) by\nH2AK13/15Ub, we quantified numbers, intensities, and sizes of\nReader1.0-eGFP foci in G1-, S-, and G2-phase in cells depleted of\nputative Ub–nucleosome writers (RNF8 and RNF168), readers\n(53BP1, BARD1, RNF169, and RAD18), and erasers (USP3, USP11,\nUSP16, USP48, and USP51; Fig. 6 C, Fig. 7, and Data S1).\nIt has been reported that foci sizes of different DNA repair\nfactors correlate with repair pathway choice, with factors in-\nvolved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) forming larger foci\nthan those in homologous recombination (HR; Luijsterburg\net al., 2017). Indeed, we observed that average Reader1.0 foci\nsize follows the trend G1 > S > G2, consistent with preferred\nrepair pathway choice associated with each cell cycle phase\n(Fig. 6 B and Data S1).\nIn asynchronous cell populations without cell cycle classifi-\ncation, depletion of RNF8 or RNF168 resulted in decreased\nnumbers and intensities of Reader1.0 foci (Fig. 6 C and Data S1).\nWhereas RNF168 knockdown was characterized by an increased\nfraction of cells in G1 as previously reported (Schmid et al., 2018;\nFig. 7 A and Data S1), cells depleted of RNF8 showed a global\nreduction of both Cdt11-17-iRFP682 and mCherry-Geminin1-110,\nthereby precluding their cell cycle classification (Fig. S4 D).\nShifts in cell cycle distribution marked by an increased G1\nfraction with concomitant decrease in S-phase cells were also\nobserved with 53BP1 and BARD1 depletion.

Finally,\nRNF169 knockdown moderately increased the fraction of cells in\nG1, and RAD18 knockdown led to a small decrease in the fraction\nof cells in G2 (Fig. 7 A and Data S1).\nIn addition to RNF8 and RNF168 knockdowns, prominent\neffects on Reader1.0 focal accumulation were observed in cells\ndepleted of 53BP1, BARD1, RNF169, or USP51 (Fig. 6 C, Fig. 7 E,\nand Data S1). 53BP1 depletion significantly increased the number\nof Reader1.0 foci in G1 and the foci intensities in both G1 and S\nphases. Statistically significant increases in foci size were also\nobserved, although the magnitudes of the changes were small\n(Fig. 7, B–E). These findings are consistent with two possibilities:\n(1) loss of 53BP1 may promote an increase in H2AK13/15Ub in G1\nand S phases, or (2) reduced competition by endogenous 53BP1\nallows more Reader1.0 to bind to H2AK13/15Ub-containing nu-\ncleosomes. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Our\nresults strongly support that 53BP1 is the major reader for the\nH2AK13/15Ub signal in G1 and possibly early S phase.\nA recent manuscript suggests that BARD1 may also be a\nreader for H2AK15Ub (Becker et al., 2020). We found that BARD1\nknockdown led to increases in both the number and intensities\nof Reader1.0 foci throughout the cell cycle. Unlike 53BP1 de-\npletion, which had its biggest impact in G1 phase, the effect of\nBARD1 knockdown was greatest in G2 (Fig. 7, D and E; and Data\nS1), consistent with the roles of BRCA1/BARD1 in HR and repli-\ncation fork protection (Tarsounas and Sung, 2020). Although\nour data are consistent with the possibility that BARD1 is a direct\nreader of H2AK13/15Ub (Becker et al., 2020), BARD1 depletion\nmay also impede resolution of DSBs, thereby increasing\nH2AK13/15Ub. To test this, we assessed Reader1.0 foci in cells\ntransfected with siRNA targeting another HR repair factor, the\nCtBP-interacting protein CtIP, which participates in both DNA\nend resection and protection of stalled replication forks\n(Przetocka et al., 2018; Sartori et al., 2007). Similar to BARD1\nknockdown,\nCtIP\nknockdown\nincreased\nthe\nnumber\nof\nReader1.0 foci as well as foci intensities and sizes, particularly in\nthe S and G2 phases (Fig. S5 and Data S1).\nRelative to 53BP1 and BARD1, depletion of the H2AK13/15Ub\nreaders RNF169 and RAD18 had smaller effects. RNF169 knock-\ndown increased Reader1.0 foci number in G1, S, and G2 phases\nwith little impact on foci intensity or size (Fig. 7, B–E; and Data\nS1). Also, despite the twofold increase in Reader1.0 foci number,\nRNF169 knockdown cells in G2 showed modestly reduced foci\nintensity; possibly, rather than competing with 53BP1 or BARD1,\nRNF169 restricts RNF168 activity (Panier et al., 2012). Finally,\nRAD18 knockdown had little effect and showed only a small\nincrease in Reader1.0 foci number in G2 phase that may arise\nfrom its role in post-replicative DNA repair (Huang et al., 2009).\nAmong the many DUBs that participate in DNA damage re-\npair pathways, we examined several reported to target Ub–\nnucleosomes. USP3, USP11, USP16, and USP51 were proposed to\nbe involved in the RNF8–RNF168 signaling axis (Uckelmann and\nSixma, 2017), whereas USP48 was reported to target H2AK125/\n127/129Ub (Uckelmann et al., 2018). Of these, USP51 knockdown\nshowed the most pronounced effects on Reader1.0 foci, causing\nsmall increases of foci number in G1- and G2- and marked in-\ncreases of foci intensity in G1-phase cells (Fig. 7, B–E; and Data\nS1). These findings point to a potential role of USP51 in NHEJ-\nmediated repair. In contrast, depletion of USP3, USP11, USP16,\nand USP48 yielded only minor changes in the profiles of\nFigure 6.\nA system to monitor H2AK13/K15Ub across the cell cycle in unperturbed cells.

Adopting this strategy, a previous work\ncombined multiple reader domains into probes for combinato-\nrial histone tail PTMs (Su and Denu, 2015). Recent structural\ncharacterizations of several protein–nucleosome complexes\nhave revealed a new mechanism of recruitment characterized by\nsimultaneous interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch and a\nPTM covalently attached to a histone tail (Anderson et al., 2019;\nFradet-Turcotte et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Kitevski-LeBlanc\net al., 2017; Valencia-S´anchez et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2016;\nWorden et al., 2019; Worden et al., 2020). Inspired by this mode\nof interaction, we extended an avidity-based strategy used\npreviously for (poly)Ub (Choi et al., 2019a; Sims et al., 2012) to\ndesign protein sensors that target Ub–nucleosomes in live cells.\nThe sensors we generated, Reader1.0/1.1 and Reader2.0/2.1,\nwere assembled from independent binding domains, a UBD that\nbinds to Ub and an anchor that binds to the nucleosome acidic\npatch, connected by a linker chosen to promote avidity (Fig. 1, B,\nC, and E; and Fig. S1). By choosing anchors and UBDs with Kds in\nthe range of 10−5 to 10−6 M, we are able to generate Ub–\nnucleosome sensors with Kds of ∼10−8 M. Such affinities are on\npar with those of published live-cell PTM sensors, such as a\nsingle-chain\nvariable\nfragment\nderivative\nthat\nrecognizes\nH4K20me (Zhao et al., 2019). For Reader1.0, binding to H2AK13/\n15Ub at DNA DSBs was comparable to that of the cognate reader\ndomain from 53BP1 (Fig. 5, D and E; and Table 1), and FRAP\nanalyses showed similar binding by Reader2.0/2.1 for endoge-\nnous H2BK120Ub (Fig. 3, D and E; and Table 1). Importantly,\nwhen expressed at low levels, Reader1.0 did not detectably affect\nDNA repair efficiency (Fig. 5, F and G). Thus, it is possible to\ngenerate Ub–nucleosome sensors that allow live-cell detection of\nthe signal without significantly perturbing physiology.\nSignaling by a PTM frequently depends on the identity of the\nmodification site. Because this is a particularly prominent fea-\nture of chromatin PTMs, site selectivity is a key challenge to\ndevelopment of high-affinity probes for modified nucleosomes.\nIn many naturally occurring readers, docking onto the nucleo-\nsome acidic patch serves to limit the search space of a PTM-\nrecognition domain, thereby facilitating interactions between\nthe reader molecule and the modified target. With respect to\nhistone ubiquitination, in vitro selectivity for the prototype\nsensors Reader1.0/1.1 was partially achieved by taking advantage\nof the orientation of the LANA anchor peptide bound to a nu-\ncleosome (Barbera et al., 2006) and by the use of a linker with\nhigh α-helical propensity (i.e., antiparallel coiled-coil) to limit\nmobility of the tethered UBD (Fig. 1, B, C, and F). Additionally,\nMD simulations identified unique features of H2BK120Ub–\nnucleosomes that helped to guide the designs of Reader2.0/2.1\n(Fig. 2). Strikingly, the simulations suggested that nucleosomes\nwith H2BK120Ub can sample a greater range of conformations\nthan those with H2AK15Ub (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with our\nin silico predictions, recent structures of H2BK120Ub–nucleosome\ncomplexes illustrate this variability and suggest that H2BK120Ub\nreaders and erasers can engage their target in a variety of ori-\nentations (Worden et al., 2020). Of particular importance for\nsensor design, the MD simulations identified a cluster of con-\nformations in which selected combinations of anchors and UBDs\ncould bind to H2BK120Ub but not to H2AK15Ub (Fig. 2, B–D).\nReader2.0/2.1 were constructed accordingly, and determination\nof their affinities for nucleosomes in vitro (Fig. 2 H) and binding\nkinetics in vivo (Fig. 3, D and E; and Table 1) confirmed the\npredictions.\nSensor behavior within cells\nExpression of Reader1.0/2.0/2.1 in mammalian cells revealed\naspects of affinity and selectivity that were unanticipated from\nin vitro assays with purified nucleosomes containing non-\nhydrolyzable Ub–histone mimics (Long et al., 2014). The FRAP\nanalyses suggest that the anchor domains are the primary de-\nterminants of Reader1.0/2.0/2.1 binding to Ub–nucleosomes;\ndocking of LANA or IE1 onto the nucleosome acidic patch facil-\nitates UBD interactions, thereby boosting overall affinity via the\navidity effect (Fig. 3, C–E; Fig. 4, C and D; and Table 1). Whereas\nReader2.0/2.1 bind H2BK120Ub selectively both in vitro and\nin vivo (Fig. 2 H; Fig. 3, D and E; and Table 1), Reader 1.0 does not\ndistinguish H2AK13/15Ub from H2BK120Ub in vitro (Fig. 1 F) but\nis selective for H2AK13/15Ub in cells (Fig. 3, D and E; Fig. 4, C and\nD; and Table 1). Recently it was reported that LANA binding to\nnucleosomes in vitro is antagonized by Ub conjugation at\nH2BK120 (Anderson et al., 2019); nonetheless, Reader1.0 binds\nto purified H2BK120Ub–nucleosomes with high affinity, sug-\ngesting that UBD•Ub interactions may compensate for weak-\nened LANA binding. In cells, as suggested by our FRAP results,\nanchor binding to the nucleosome acidic patch is a major com-\nponent of the avidity that underlies stable interactions between\nthe sensors and Ub–nucleosomes. Moreover, the UBD contri-\nbution will be weakened by competition from the high content\nof free Ub in the nucleus (5–20 µM; Choi et al., 2019a; Clague\net al., 2015). In the case of H2AK13/15Ub, binding in cells may be\nmaintained through the more stable anchor•acidic patch in-\nteraction; also, other histone modifications or associated pro-\nteins could restrict the ensemble of allowed Ub–nucleosome\nconformers, thereby reducing the opportunities for binding\n(i.e., reducing the effective association rate constant, kon) of\nfrom pairwise comparisons with siCtrl are shown, with significant (P < 0.01) increases highlighted in red and significant decreases in green.

Indeed, modulation of either kon or the\ndissociation rate koff of the sensor could depend on the nucleo-\nsome environment that in vivo might differentiate H2AK13/\n15Ub from H2BK120Ub with respect to sensor binding. In any\nevent, our results show that estimates of affinity and selectivity\nbased solely on in vitro equilibrium binding can be misleading.\nFirst, such approaches do not establish the rates of association\nand dissociation needed to predict residence times on chroma-\ntin. Second, in vitro binding assays are unlikely to capture the\ncomplexity of the chromatin environment. For these reasons,\ncharacterization of the sensors and their individual components\nusing FRAP in live cells has been most informative.\nReader1.0 is a live-cell sensor for H2AK13/15Ub in unperturbed\ncells\nIn both NHEJ and HR pathways for DNA DSB repair, H2AK13/\n15Ub–nucleosomes are a critical signal. Recently, RNF168 was\nfound to be involved in replication fork progression in the ab-\nsence of DNA damage inducers (Schmid et al., 2018), suggesting\nan expanded role for H2AK13/15Ub-dependent signaling. The\nhigh affinity and selectivity of Reader1.0 enabled the detection of\nH2AK13/15Ub-enriched regions in chromatin in cells without\nthe need of exogenous DNA damage agents, thereby allowing us\nto interrogate how potential effectors of H2AK13/15Ub are reg-\nulated throughout the cell cycle. High-content analysis of\nReader1.0 foci number, intensity, and size revealed that there\nmay be multiple H2AK13/15Ub readers that are functionally\ndistinct (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7).\nCells depleted of RNF168, 53BP1, or BARD1 showed a G1/S\narrest, underscoring the importance of H2AK13/15Ub for\nS-phase entry and DNA replication (Fig. 7 A). Whereas RNF168\nknockdown reduced Reader1.0 foci, depletion of 53BP1, BARD1,\nor CtIP led to increases in both Reader1.0 foci number and flu-\norescence intensities, reflecting either increased availability of\nH2AK13/15Ub for sensor binding or H2AK13/15Ub accumulation\ndue to defective DNA repair (Fig. 7 E and Fig. S5 C). In contrast,\nknockdown of RNF169 or RAD18 increased Reader1.0 foci\nnumber without effects on foci intensity (Fig. 7 E), suggesting a\nrole in restricting RNF168 activities (Hu et al., 2017; Panier et al.,\n2012). Although we are not certain that the levels of protein\ndepletion were similar among these knockdowns (only quanti-\ntative RT-PCR [RT-qPCR] analyses were done; Fig. S4 E), our\nresults suggest that 53BP1 and BARD1 contribute most to\nH2AK13/15Ub recognition. It is well established that 53BP1 re-\nquires both H2AK15Ub and H4K20me2 for binding to nucleo-\nsomes (Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013; Pellegrino et al., 2017;\nWilson et al., 2016), but BARD1 only recently has been proposed\nto be recruited by the combination of H2AK15Ub and the post-\nreplicative mark H4K20me0 (Becker et al., 2020; Nakamura\net al., 2019). Thus, 53BP1 appears to play a major role in read-\ning H2AK15Ub in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas BARD1\nmay have a dominant role in the late S and early G2 phases; this\nis in line with what we observed (Fig. 7, B–E). However, the\nBARD1 knockdown phenotype was similar to that observed for\ncells depleted of CtIP (Fig. S5). This may be similar to the re-\nported increase of 53BP1 foci when HR is defective (Przetocka\net al., 2018). Future experiments are needed to test if Reader1.0\ndirectly competes with BARD1 for binding to H2AK15Ub–\nnucleosomes.\nMultiple DUBs have been proposed to remove the Ub–histone\nsignals generated by RNF8 and RNF168 (Mosbech et al., 2013;\nNicassio et al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Yu\net al., 2016), but controversies remain as to whether they are\nH2AK13/15Ub-specific. Also unknown is whether these DUBs\nfunction in the absence of induced DNA damage. Depletion of\nDUBs reported to be involved in DNA DSB repair generally re-\nsulted in only minor changes in Reader1.0 accumulation; USP51\nknockdown, however, significantly increased Reader1.0 foci\nintensity in G1 cells (Fig. 7 E), consistent with a previous study\n(Wang et al., 2016). Interestingly, USP51 knockdown was ac-\ncompanied by a prominent increase of total nuclear 53BP1 and\n53BP1 foci (Fig. S4, F–H). Presumably, competition from the\nincreased 53BP1 reduced Reader1.0 recruitment into foci; nota-\nbly, this attenuation of the sensor response did not prevent the\nidentification of the USP51 knockdown phenotype, underscoring\nthe excellent dynamic range of Reader1.0 as a reporter.\nLimitations\nWe have found that signals from Reader1.0-eGFP foci generally\nwere much higher in live cells. Upon fixation with paraformal-\ndehyde, Reader1.0 accumulation at endogenous DNA damage\nsites is barely visible (see Fig. S4 F as an example). Similar ob-\nservations with other proteins have been attributed to short-\nlived interactions that, despite being detected in living cells,\nare not efficiently captured by chemical cross-linking (Schmiedeberg\net al., 2009). For Reader1.0, these transient interactions are\npresumed to reduce interference with the endogenous repair\nmachinery, but a disadvantage is that the sensor is unlikely to\nperform well as an antibody substitute in standard protocols\nfor chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or im-\nmunofluorescence experiments.\nAnother limitation is that, despite the similar affinities\nmeasured in vitro, we do not know if Reader1.0 binds H2AK13Ub\nand H2AK15Ub equally in cells. Moreover, we anticipate that\nReader1.0 is unlikely to distinguish H2A from other histone H2A\nvariants (e.g., H2A.X, H2A.Z, and macroH2A) that also can be\nubiquitinated by RNF168 (Kelliher et al., 2020). Finally, as we\nobserved for the H2BK120Ub sensors Reader2.0/2.1, apparent\nbinding selectivity can be affected by the local concentrations of\nUb–nucleosomes. Therefore, the possibility of off-target binding\nmust be considered in the experimental design.\nThat Reader1.0 expressed at increasing levels proportionally\ninhibited 53BP1-FFR accumulation at DNA DSBs indicates that\nit will, as expected, compete with the DNA repair machinery\nrecruited by H2AK13/15Ub (Fig. 5). This finding highlights that\ncompetition with endogenous proteins is an inescapable fea-\nture not only of Reader1.0 but of virtually any live-cell sensor\nthat binds a physiological target. Consequently, tight control of\nsensor expression levels is critical to minimize interference\nwith endogenous pathways due to competition. In our study,\na system using Dox-inducible stable expression afforded\nReader1.0 levels that could efficiently report H2AK13/15Ub\nwithout causing detectable perturbation to DNA repair (Fig. 5,\nF and G).\ndos Santos Passos et al.\nJournal of Cell Biology\n13 of 20\nLive-cell sensors for ubiquitinated nucleosomes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911130\nDownloaded from http://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/220/4/e201911130/1818718/jcb_201911130.pdf by Bio-protocol user on 23 October 2025\n\nIn summary, our design strategy yielded genetically encoded\nsensors that can directly detect site-specific histone ubiquiti-\nnation in chromatin. Reader1.0 is a highly sensitive and selective\nreporter of DNA damage–associated H2AK13/15Ub, whereas\nReader2.0/2.1 reported transcription-associated H2BK120Ub in\nchromatin. When expressed at low levels, the sensors could be\nused to track H2AK13/15Ub or H2BK120Ub, respectively. We\nanticipate that this ability to detect changes in histone ubiq-\nuitination status can be exploited in assays to screen or validate\nepigenetic modulators. These sensors are particularly suited to\nreal-time observations of live cells and make possible monitor-\ning of processes in single cells over extended times. With ap-\npropriate fluorescent reporters, the sensors also could be\nsuitable for observations in transgenic animal models. Finally,\nby increasing the repertoire of binding modules, we anticipate\nthat the avidity-based strategy described here can be extended\nto develop live-cell sensors for other nucleosome PTMs.\nMaterials and methods\nPreparation of Ub–nucleosome sensors\nHis6-Reader1.0, His6-GB1-Reader2.0, His6-GB1-Reader2.1, and\nHis6-GB1-IE1-tSR (pan-Ub–nucleosome sensor) were cloned into\npET28a and transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) Escherichia\ncoli cells for protein expression. Expression was induced by the\naddition of 0.4 mM IPTG to cells grown at 37°C to an optical\ndensity (OD660 nm) of 0.6–0.8, and then growth was continued at\n25°C for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at\n3,200 g, resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 10 mM\nβ-mercaptoethanol), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were\nclarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C at 20,199 g. A Hi-\nsTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) was used to isolate the His6-\ntagged proteins from the lysates. Samples were loaded into the\ncolumn preequilibrated with buffer A, and, after washing with\n20 column volumes, bound proteins were eluted with a linear\ngradient to 250 mM imidazole in buffer A. Proteins were further\npurified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column\n(GE Healthcare) eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, and 1 mM tris(2-car-\nboxyethyl)phosphine. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. His6-\nReader1.0 and His6-GB1-IE1-tSR were labeled with Alexa Fluor\n488 as described elsewhere (Choi et al., 2019a).\nPreparation of Ub–histones and reconstitution of nucleosome\ncore particles\nRecombinant human histones H2A, H2B, H3.3, and H4 as\nwell as mutant histones H2AK15C, H2AK119C, H2AK129C,\nand H2BK120C were obtained from The Histone Source –\nProtein Expression and Purification Facility at Colorado State\nUniversity. H2AK13C was generated by site-specific mutation\nof histone H2A cloned into pET21a followed by expression and\npurification from BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) E. coli cells (Dyer et al.,\n2004). His6-UbG76C (Long et al., 2014) as well as the 147-mer\n(Dyer et al., 2004) or the non-linker-ended tri-nucleosomes\n(Carruthers et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2011) DNA fragments\nwere expressed and purified as described. Ub–histones were\nprepared by cross-linking with 1,3-dichloroacetone (DCA; Long\net al., 2014). Briefly, His6-UbG76C and H2AK13C/H2AK15C/\nH2AK119C/H2AK129C/H2BK120C (1:1, Ub:histone molar ratio)\nwere mixed in cross-linking buffer (50 mM sodium tetraborate,\npH 8.5, 6 M urea, and 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and\nincubated at room temperature for 30 min to reduce cysteines.\nThe mixture was cooled to 4°C, and DCA (1:1:1, Ub:histone:DCA\nmolar ratio) was added; after 60 min, reactions were stopped\nwith 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Next, the reaction mixtures\nwere diluted 1:10 in denaturing binding buffer (50 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 10 mM imidazole,\nand 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded into a HisTrap HP\ncolumn for purification of the His6-tagged proteins. After washing\nwith 10 column volumes, bound proteins were eluted with a linear\ngradient to 125 mM imidazole in denaturing binding buffer. Elu-\nates contained cross-linked Ub–histones, unreacted His6-UbG76C,\nand\ncross-linked\nHis6-diubiquitin.\nBecause\nunreacted\nHis6-\nUbG76C and His6-diubiquitin do not interfere with the refolding\nand assembly of histones into octamers, the mixtures obtained\nfrom the HisTrap column were used as the source of Ub–histones\nin the subsequent refolding steps.\nReconstitution of histone octamers was performed as de-\nscribed (Dyer et al., 2004; Long et al., 2014). Purified octamers\nwere concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filters (Mil-\nlipore) to ∼40 µM and stored at –80°C in refolding buffer\nsupplemented with 20% glycerol (vol/vol). Mononucleosomes\nand tri-nucleosomes containing H2AK13Ub, H2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub,\nH2AK129Ub, or H2BK120Ub were assembled by mixing the re-\nspective histone octamers with the 147-mer or non-linker-ended\ntri-nucleosomes DNA fragments in high salt (10 mM Tris-\nHCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and\n2 M NaCl) at 30°C, followed by stepwise dilution to reach a final\nsalt concentration corresponding to 100 mM NaCl (Carruthers\net al., 1999; Dyer et al., 2004; Winkler et al., 2011). Mono-\nnucleosomes and tri-nucleosomes were analyzed by native PAGE\nand SDS-PAGE and used for binding assays. Tri-nucleosomes an-\nalyzed by native PAGE were first digested with EcoRI to generate\nmononucleosomes containing 223-, 207-, or 191-bp DNA frag-\nments, as previously described (Winkler et al., 2011).\nBinding assays\nAll binding assays were done at room temperature in PBS\nbuffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.05% Brij35, 0.2 mg/ml\novalbumin, and 1 mM DTT. A FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorome-\nter (HORIBA Scientific) was used to measure fluorescence of\nthe Alexa Fluor 488–labeled ligands. Reader1.0/1.1 affinities\nfor mononucleosomes and tri-nucleosomes containing H2AK13Ub,\nH2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub, H2AK129Ub, and H2BK120Ub were\ndetermined by measuring fluorescence changes in Alexa Fluor\n488–labeled Reader1.0 (5–20 nM) upon titration with increas-\ning concentrations of the respective nucleosomes. Reader2.0/\n2.1 affinities for mononucleosomes and tri-nucleosomes con-\ntaining H2AK15Ub and H2BK120Ub were measured by com-\npetition with Alexa Fluor 488–labeled Reader1.0 (5–20 nM) in\nthe presence of 20–30 nM H2AK15Ub/H2BK120Ub and titra-\ntion with Reader2.0/2.1. Reader2.0/2.1 affinities for mono-\nnucleosomes and tri-nucleosomes containing H2AK119Ub and\nH2AK129Ub were measured by competition with Alexa Fluor\ndos Santos Passos et al.\nJournal of Cell Biology\n14 of 20\nLive-cell sensors for ubiquitinated nucleosomes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911130\nDownloaded from http://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/220/4/e201911130/1818718/jcb_201911130.pdf by Bio-protocol user on 23 October 2025\n\n488–labeled IE1-tSR (20–50 nM) in the presence of 40–100 nM\nH2AK119Ub or H2AK129Ub, and titrations with Reader2.0/2.1.\nKd and Ki values were calculated by fitting with a single-site\nbinding model using GraphPad Prism v.8 software (Cheng and\nPrusoff, 1973).\nAll-atom MD simulations\nMD simulations were done using the GROMACS package v4.6.5\n(Pronk et al., 2013) with graphics processing unit acceleration\nand message passing interface parallelization. The Amber\nff99SB-ILDN force field for proteins and nucleic acids (Lindorff-\nLarsen et al., 2010) was modified to simulate the isopeptide bond\nbetween either H2AK15 or H2BK120 and UbG76 (Gavrilov et al.,\n2015). A time step of 2 fs was used for integration of equations of\nmotion. Initial velocities were generated from the Maxwell–\nBoltzmann distribution with random seeds, and the Verlet cutoff\nscheme was used for neighbor searching with nstlist set to 20\nsteps. The van der Waals interactions were treated with a cutoff\nof 1.4 nm, while long-range electrostatic effects were treated\nwith the particle mesh Ewald method and a cutoff of 1.4 nm\n(Darden et al., 1993). Bond lengths were constrained by the\nLINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm.\nAtomic coordinates for H2AK15Ub (RCSB Protein Data Bank\n[PDB] accession no. 5KGF; Wilson et al., 2016) and H2BK120Ub\n(PDB accession no. 4ZUX; Morgan et al., 2016) nucleosomes were\nretrieved from the PDB. Initial models for MD simulations were\nformed by one copy of the H2A/H2B dimer (H2A: from K9 to\nL97; H2B: from S32 to K125), the surrounding DNA double helix\n(29 bases in each DNA strand), and Ub linked through an iso-\npeptide bond to either H2AK15 or H2BK120 (Fig. 2 A). When\nnecessary, side chains were mutated to match amino acid se-\nquences to the human histones (H2A type 1: Uniprot P0C0S8;\nH2B type 1: Uniprot P62807). Models were placed into rhombic\ndodecahedral periodic boxes (12 ˚A distance on each side of the\nsimulated complexes) filled with TIP3P water molecules plus\nNa+ and Cl−ions, which were added to neutralize DNA phos-\nphate backbones and maintain the salt at 150 mM. Systems were\nsubjected to 5,000 cycles of steepest-descent energy minimization\nwith the maximum step size set to 0.01 nm and the tolerance set to\n1,000 kJ • mol−1 • nm−1. After minimization, systems were se-\nquentially equilibrated under position restraints with the constant\ntemperature, constant volume (NVT) ensemble at 393 K for 100 ps\nusing v-rescale temperature coupling, and the isothermal-isobaric\n(NPT) ensemble for 1 ns using Nos´e–Hoover temperature coupling\nand Parrinello–Rahman pressure coupling. Position restraints\nwere removed, and production MD simulations were performed at\n393 K for 20 ns using Nos´e–Hoover temperature coupling and\nParrinello–Rahman pressure coupling. Each model (i.e., H2AK15Ub\nand H2BK120Ub) was subjected to a total of 10 independent MD\nsimulations comprising NVT and NPT equilibration plus 20 ns\nproduction. Trajectories were post-processed with GROMACS\ntrjconv to fix periodicity effects.\nRigid docking of anchors and UBDs into H2AK15Ub and\nH2BK120Ub MD ensembles\nH2AK15Ub and H2BK120Ub conformations resulting from 10 ×\n20 ns MD simulations extracted at every 2-ps time interval were\nsuperimposed onto the H2A/H2B dimer of a reference nucleo-\nsome (PDB accession no. 1AOI; Luger et al., 1997) using pdb-tools\nand NumPy Python scripts. Next, the LANA (Barbera et al.,\n2006) and IE1 (Fang et al., 2016) anchors, and the tSR (Choi\net al., 2019b; Lee et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005) and UBQ1UBA\n(Zhang et al., 2008) UBDs were individually docked into the\nensemble of H2AK15Ub and H2BK120Ub conformations by\nstructural superposition. For anchor rigid docking, the dimer\nH2A/H2B in the LANA–nucleosome (PDB accession no. 1ZLA) or\nIE1–nucleosome (PDB accession no. 5E5A) complex was super-\nimposed onto the dimer H2A/H2B in the MD ensembles. For\nUBD rigid docking, Ub in the complexes S5aUIM1-Ub (PDB ac-\ncession no. 1YX5), Rabex5Ruz-Ub (PDB accession no. 2FIF), and\nUBQ1UBA-Ub (PDB accession no. 2JY6) was superimposed onto\nUb in the MD ensembles; the docked complexes were then fil-\ntered for steric clashes using SHARPEN (Loksha et al., 2009).\nClash-free conformations, in which the nucleosome acidic patch\nand Ub were respectively accessible to anchors and UBDs, were\ndefined as those with <20 atom pairs within <2 ˚A of each other.\nThis approach allowed us to determine the fractions of H2AK15Ub\nand H2BK120Ub conformations that were accessible to different\ncombinations of anchors and UBDs and to map Ub dynamics when\nit was linked to either H2AK15 or H2BK120. Finally, a Biopython\nscript was used to calculate the distances separating the nucleo-\nsome acidic patch (i.e., H2AE61, δ carbon) from Ub I44 (β carbon)\nin all nonclashing conformations that were simultaneously ac-\ncessible to IE1 and UBQ1UBA.\nPlasmids for mammalian expression\nReader1.0/2.0/2.1 constructs were made using In-Fusion cloning\n(Takarabio). For lentiviral expression, Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP\nfragments were amplified by PCR and cloned by In-Fusion into\nXhoI/EcoRI digested pTRIPZ vector. mCherry-BP1-2 pLPC-Puro\n(mCherry-53BP1-FFR) was from Titia de Lange (Rockefeller\nUniversity, New York, NY; Addgene plasmid 19835); pLenti-\nPGK-Neo-PIP-FUCCI was from Jean Cook (University of North\nCarolina, Chapel Hill, NC; Addgene plasmid 118616). In-Fusion\ncloning was used to replace mVenus in pLenti-PGK-Neo-PIP-\nFUCCI by iRFP682. All constructs were verified by sequencing.\nCell culture, transient transfection, and viral transduction\nU-2 OS cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured\nin DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas Bio-\nlogicals), 1% penicillin plus streptomycin (Corning), and 2 mM\nL-glutamine (Hyclone). hTERT-RPE-1 cells were cultured in\nDMEM/F-12 50/50 (Corning) with L-glutamine supplemented\nwith 10% FBS and 1% penicillin plus streptomycin; cells were\nmaintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nTransient expression was achieved by transfection with Lip-\nofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions.\nTo make stable cell lines, HEK293T cells were cotransfected\nwith psPAX2 (Addgene; plasmid 12260), pMD2.G (Addgene;\nplasmid 12259), and pTRIPZ-Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP. Viral su-\npernatants were harvested after 48 h, and U-2 OS cells were\ntransduced in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene. At 48 h after\ntransduction,\ninfected cells\nwere selected\nwith 2\nµg/ml\ndos Santos Passos et al.\nJournal of Cell Biology\n15 of 20\nLive-cell sensors for ubiquitinated nucleosomes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911130\nDownloaded from http://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/220/4/e201911130/1818718/jcb_201911130.pdf by Bio-protocol user on 23 October 2025\n\npuromycin. Expression of Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP was induced\nby 4–24 h treatment with 10–100 ng/ml Dox (Thermo Fisher\nScientific). To generate U-2 OS/PIP-FUCCI/Reader1.0 stable\ncells, lentiviral particles carrying pLenti-PGK-Neo-PIP-FUCCI\n(with mVenus replaced by iRFP682) were made as described\nabove. At 48 h after transduction, infected cells were selected with\n400 µg/ml G-418 (Research Products International; G64000-1.0).\nMonoclonal cells were isolated by limiting dilution and tested for\nCdt11-17-iRFP682 and mCherry-Geminin1-110 expression. One clone\nwas selected for another transduction with lentiviral particles\ncarrying pTRIPZ-Reader1.0-eGFP. Expression of Reader1.0 was\ninduced by 24 h treatment with 10–50 ng/ml Dox.\nWestern blotting and immunofluorescence\nWhole-cell lysates were obtained by lysing cells in 50 mM Tris-\nHCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitors\n(Sigma-Aldrich; P8340), followed by sonication and clarification\nby centrifugation. Primary antibodies and the dilutions used\nwere as follows: anti-GFP (CST; rabbit monoclonal; 2656, 1:1,000), anti-\nmCherry (Abcam; mouse monoclonal; 125096; 1:1,000), anti-HA\n(Sigma-Aldrich; mouse monoclonal; H3663; 1:5,000), anti-H2AK119Ub\n(CST; rabbit monoclonal; 8240; 1:1,000), anti-H2BK120Ub (CST; rabbit\nmonoclonal; 5546; 1:1,000), and anti-H2B (Abcam; mouse monoclonal;\n52484; 1:1,000). Western signals were visualized by fluorescent sec-\nondary antibodies and imaged using LI-COR Odyssey.\nU-2 OS cells transiently transfected with Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-\neGFP for 24 h were fixed with 2.5% PFA in PBS for 15 min at 37°C,\nand permeablized with 100% methanol for 10 min at −20°C. Cells\nwere then blocked for 1 h with 3% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in\nPBS. Next, cells were immunostained with a rabbit mAb against\nH2BK120Ub (CST; mAb; 5546; diluted 1:800 with 1% BSA and\n0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h and with an Alexa Fluor\n568–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific;\ndiluted 1:500 with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h.\nU-2 OS cells stably expressing Reader1.0-eGFP were treated\nwith 0 or 100 ng/ml Dox for 24 h before being exposed to IR (1.5\nGy) using a 137Cs gamma-ray source. Cells were fixed with 3.7%\nPFA for 20 min at room temperature at times 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and\n24 h after IR, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for\n20 min, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and immunostained\nwith a mouse mAb against γH2AX (Millipore; 05–636; diluted 1:\n1,750 in blocking buffer) for 2 h and with an Alexa Fluor 568–\nconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific;\ndiluted 1:500 with blocking buffer) for 1 h. Staining with anti-\n53BP1 (Abcam; rabbit monoclonal; 175933, diluted 1:500 in\nblocking buffer) followed the same procedure. Nuclei were\ncounterstained with DAPI (MP Biomedicals). Coverslips were\nmounted onto slides using ProLong Diamond Antifade (Thermo\nFisher Scientific).\nRNAi transfections and RT-qPCR\nCells were transfected twice at 0 h and 24 h with 10 nM silencing\nRNAs: siCtrl pool, siCtrl #1, siRNF168, siRNF8, si53BP1, siBARD1,\nsiUSP3, siUSP11, siUSP16, siUSP48, and siUSP51, and analyzed at\n72 h. For Silencer Select siRNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific), cells\nwere transfected once with 10 nM siCtrl #2, siRNF169, and\nsiRAD18 and analyzed 72 h later. Single transfection of 10 nM\nsiCtrl #1, siBARD1, and siCtIP were also employed in Fig. S5.\nsiRNA\ntransfections\nwere\nperformed\nwith\nLipofectamine\nRNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manu-\nfacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was extracted using the Au-\nrum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad). First-strand cDNAs were\ngenerated from 100 ng total RNA with the iScript Reverse Tran-\nscription Supermix (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR reactions contained\n2 µl of diluted cDNA, 250 nM forward and reverse primers, and\nSsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All the\nreactions were run on a CFX96 quantitative PCR system (Bio-Rad).\nRelative mRNA levels were normalized against that of GAPDH.\nThe Pffafl formula was applied for efficiency correction (Pfaffl,\n2001). Primers used for RT-qPCR are listed in Table S2.\nData for siCtrl #1, siBARD1, siUSP3, sUSP11, siUSP16, siUSP48,\nand siUSP51 correspond to two technical replicates from a single\nexperiment, while data for siCtrl #2, siRNF169, and siRAD18\ncorrespond to two biological replicates (with two technical\nreplicates for each experiment; Fig. S4 E).\nMicroscopy\nConfocal microscopy of fixed and live cells was performed on a\nZeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat\n63×/1.40 oil-immersion objective. For live-cell imaging, a stage\nincubator (PECON, PM 2000 RBT) was used to maintain 37°C\nand a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Live-cell imaging acquisition was\nperformed using cells plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom dishes\n(MatTek; P35G-1.5-14-C) or four-chamber glass-bottom dishes\n(Cellvis; D35C4-20-1.5-N) and kept in FluoroBrite DMEM\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific; A1896701) supplemented with 10%\nFBS, 1% penicillin plus streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nThe Zen 2.3 (black edition) software (v.14.0.9.201) was used for\nimage capture. The Processing and Analysis modules of the ZEN\n2.3 (blue edition) software (v.2.3.69.1000) were used to extract\nmaximum intensity projections of z-stacks, measure fluores-\ncence intensities, and count γH2AX foci.\nFRAP in undamaged nuclei\nU-2 OS cells were transfected with Reader1.0/2.0/2.1-eGFP or\ntheir NB variants for 4–12 h before live-cell imaging. Treatments\nwith 5 µM FVP (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 µM C1 (provided by Mil-\nlenium/Takeda) were performed 1 h before starting the meas-\nurements. Photobleaching was performed with the 488-nm line\nfrom a 35 mW Ar laser operating at 75% power. The pinhole was\nset to 1.51 Airy Units (1.1 µm z-section). Fluorescence recovery\nwas monitored at intervals of 0.5 s using the 488-nm laser line at\n0.5% power and a photomultiplier tube detector. For each con-\nstruct, data were obtained from two to five independent spots\nper nucleus (n ≥6 cells). Each bleached spot corresponded to a\ncircle with 30-pixel diameter (1 pixel = 0.09 × 0.09 µm). Nor-\nmalized FRAP curves were generated from raw data after\nbackground subtraction (McNally, 2008). After normalization,\nspatiotemporal FRAP recoveries were fit to one-exponential or\ntwo-exponential equations using GraphPad Prism v.8.\nLaser microirradiation and real-time recruitment assays\nTo induce DNA damage, irradiation of a 0.45-µm-high stripe in\nthe nucleus was made with the 405-nm diode laser (30 mW) at\ndos Santos Passos et al.\nJournal of Cell Biology\n16 of 20\nLive-cell sensors for ubiquitinated nucleosomes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911130\nDownloaded from http://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/220/4/e201911130/1818718/jcb_201911130.pdf by Bio-protocol user on 23 October 2025\n\n75% power. Time-lapse images were captured at 20-s intervals\nfor ∼15 min. Reader1.0-eGFP fluorescence was detected with the\n488-nm laser operating at 1.0% power, while mCherry-53BP1-\nFFR fluorescence was detected with the 561-nm diode-pumped\nsolid-state laser (20 mW) operating at 0.5% power. Fluorescence\nredistribution from regions encompassing the irradiated tracks\nwere extracted from background-corrected individual frames as\ndescribed (Lukas et al., 2004; Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005). Local\nincreases in fluorescence at the DNA lesions were calculated as\nfollows: fold Increase = It/Ipre, where It denotes the fluorescence\nintensity at the damaged region at time t, and Ipre denotes the\nfluorescence intensity before microirradiation. For kinetic pro-\nfiling, fluorescence was normalized using the following formula:\nnormalized intensity = (It – Ipre)/(Ilast – Ipre), where Ilast denotes\nthe fluorescence intensity at the lesion in the last time point.\nFRAP mobilities of Reader1.0-eGFP and mCherry-53BP1-FFR\nwere measured in a rectangular region of interest (ROI; 0.75\nµm2) at the microirradiated area and in an undamaged area of\nthe nucleus (Ctrl). Photobleaching used either the 561-nm or\nthe 488-nm laser operating at 75% power. Acquisition con-\nditions were the same as used for the real-time recruitment\nassays; fluorescence recoveries were monitored at 0.5-s inter-\nvals. Normalized FRAP curves were generated from raw data\nafter background subtraction, and spatiotemporal recoveries\nwere fit to a two-exponential equation using GraphPad\nPrism v.8.\nQuantification of Reader1.0-eGFP at endogenous DNA lesions\nU-2 OS/PIP/FUCCI cells were transfected with siRNAs as de-\nscribed above and treated with 10–50 ng/ml Dox 48 h after the\nfirst transfection to induce the expression of Reader1.0-eGFP.\nLive-cell imaging was performed 24 h after Dox treatment using\nthe 488-nm argon, 561-nm diode-pumped solid-state, and 633-\nnm HeNe lasers operated at 0.5, 0.5, and 40% power, respec-\ntively; pinholes were adjusted to correspond to a 0.9-µm section.\nImages were captured at 16-bit resolution with z-stacks acquired\nat 2-µm intervals.\nQuantifications of foci in images were done in CellProfiler\nv.3.1.9 (McQuin et al., 2018). A user-assisted approach was im-\nplemented to classify nuclei into two groups based on the in-\ntensity of\nReader1.0-eGFP. For each group, nuclei were\nsegmented by the Otsu threshold method using an adaptative\nstrategy in which pixels in the middle intensity class were as-\nsigned to foreground. Fluorescence intensities of Reader1.0-eGFP,\nmCherry-Geminin1-110, and Cdt11-17-iRFP682 within nuclear ROIs\nwere measured after subtracting the respective intensities by the\nlower-quartile intensities of the individual channels. To identify\nReader1.0-eGFP foci within the nuclear ROIs, images were first\nsubjected to White Top-Hat transformation (structuring elements\nwere defined as disks with 5-pixel radius) followed by speckles\nenhancement to intensify the foci signals. Next, foci were defined\nas circular objects 4–20 pixels in diameter (scaling per pixel: 0.16 ×\n0.16 µm) and segmented by the Robust Background method using\na global strategy. The averaging method was set as mean and the\nvariance set at three SDs.\nCell cycle classification was performed based on the MFIs of\nmCherry-Geminin1-110,\nand\nCdt11-17-iRFP682\nwithin\neach\nindividual nucleus. G1 cells were defined as those with iRFP682\nMFI > 0.07 and mCherry MFI < 0.02; S cells were defined as\nthose with iRFP682 MFI < 0.07 and mCherry MFI > 0.02; and G2\ncells were defined as those with iRFP682 MFI > 0.07 and\nmCherry MFI > 0.02. Cells with mCherry-Geminin1-110 and Cdt11-\n17-iRFP682 expressed below these thresholds were not consid-\nered for the cell cycle assignments. After cell cycle classification,\ncells were filtered based on Reader1.0-expression levels; only\ncells showing Reader1.0-eGFP MFI between 0.08 and 0.24 MFI\nwere taken into account for quantification of foci number and\nintensity. Normalized fluorescence intensities are defined as the\nratio of Reader1.0-eGFP MFI at foci/Reader1.0-eGFP fluores-\ncence in the nucleus. Foci sizes in square micrometers were\ncalculated by multiplying the foci areas provided by CellProfiler\n(pixels) by 0.0256 µm2, the pixel size in the acquired images.\nData analysis scripts are available upon request.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses of immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging\nmeasurements as well as the fitting to binding, FRAP, and real-\ntime recruitment data were performed using GraphPad Prism\nv.8 software. Correlation analyses were computed using a two-\ntailed P value. Multiple comparisons for number of Reader1.0\nfoci and normalized foci intensity were performed using\nBrown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests with Dunnet’s T3 test.\nFoci sizes, which had a minimum cutoff of 0.33 µm2, were\ncompared using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA test\nwith Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Pairwise analyses for\nnumber of Reader1.0 foci and normalized foci intensity were\nperformed by a two-tailed unpaired t test for comparisons be-\ntween siRNAs and siCtrl. Welch’s correction for unequal var-\niances was used when applicable. Data for foci sizes were\nanalyzed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test for\ncomparisons between the indicated siRNAs and siCtrl: siRNF168,\nsi53BP1, siBARD1, siUSP3, siUSP11, siUSP16, siUSP48, and\nsiUSP51 were compared with siCtrl #1; siRNF169 and siRAD18\nwere compared with siCtrl #2 (Table S1). For data analyzed by\nunpaired t test, R2 values were used to estimate effect size.\nSignificant increases or decreases with R2 > 0.05 were high-\nlighted in red and green, respectively; for the comparisons of\nfoci size, significant increases or decreases ≥0.1 µm2 were\nhighlighted in red and green, respectively. P values <0.01 were\nconsidered significant.\nPBD entries\nPDB entries used for structures shown in Fig. 1, A and B, and\nFig. 2A are 1ZBB and 1AOI (nucleosome), 1ZLA (LANA), 5E5A\n(IE1), 1YX5 (S5aUIM1), 2FIF (Rabex5Ruz), 2JY6 (UBQ1UBA), 1HF9\n(coiled-coil), 5KGF (H2AK15Ub–nucleosome), and 4ZUX (H2BK120Ub–\nnucleosome).\nOnline supplemental material\nFig. S1 shows the amino acid sequences of the Ub–nucleosome\nReaders.

(A–H) Histone octamers containing nonhydrolyzable Ub-histone mimics were\ncombined with 147-mer Widom 601 DNA to reconstitute mononucleosomes, whose quality were monitored by (A) native PAGE and (C) SDS-PAGE. Similarly,\ntri-nucleosome arrays containing H2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub, and H2BK120Ub were reconstituted with non-linker-ended tri-nucleosomes (NLE-tri) DNA\n(Carruthers et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2011), digested with EcoRI, and analyzed by (B) native PAGE and (D) SDS-PAGE. (E) Alexa Fluor 488–labeled Reader1.0\n(molecular weight = 14.3 kD) and IE1-tSR (pan-Ub–nucleosome sensor; molecular weight = 18.1 kD) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorescence\nor Coomassie staining as indicated. (F) IE1-tSR affinities for mono- or tri-nucleosomes containing H2AK119Ub and mononucleosomes containing H2AK129Ub\nwere determined by measuring fluorescence changes in Alexa Fluor 488–labeled IE1-tSR upon titration with increasing concentrations of the indicated\nUb–nucleosomes. Affinities of (G) Reader1.0 and (H) Reader2.1 for mono- and tri-nucleosome arrays containing H2AK15Ub, H2AK119Ub, and H2BK120Ub.\nTables in G and H show the results from fitting the data with a single-site binding model.
