The novel strain, originating from Wuhan, China has as of 25^th April World Health Organization report, infected over 2.7 million people and led to the deaths of over 187,000 individuals worldwide (Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation report-96, 2020). It has led to considerable disruptions in the economic and psychological welfare of populations, on top of the continuously increasing loss of life (Chen et al., 2020). Efforts at identifying possible solutions to combating the virus have thus far ranged from basic precautionary awareness campaigns to the suggestions of nucleotide based drugs currently being tested for other diseases as possible therapeutic agents (Martinez, 2020). The genome of the SARS-COV-2 novel coronavirus has been decoded and its expected proteome already established (RefSeq ID: NC_045512.2). However up until this point, to the best of our knowledge not much progress has been made in terms of identifying unique molecular features that are exclusive to this strain of the Coronavirus. Hence, in this study we made an attempt at studying the protein sequences of a relevant SARS-COV-2 architectural protein in order to identify unique advantageous features. We chose to focus our efforts on the M Protein as it is the most abundant protein in the viral nucleocapsid and is believed to be responsible for maintaining the virion in its characteristic shape (Nal, 2005). This coincides with our investigative rationale; is there any particular feature that aids the spread of this strain. The percentage of infected patients who have died from this virus has been estimated to be approximately 6.9% percent as of this writing (WHO, 2020b). Furthermore the primary susceptible groups are the immunocompromised. This leads us to believe that the primary focus needs to be on the mechanism of spreading, as the rapid rates at which this strain has infected communities across the world has arguably been its most dangerous aspect. The coronaviruses are known to contain four main structural proteins, the S, M, E, and N proteins (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). All of whom have been identified in the predicted proteome of SARS-COV-2. The S protein is the spike protein, responsible for gaining entry into the ER following infection (Delmas and Hurst, 2009; Beniac et al., 2006). The N protein resides inside the nucleocapsid and is an RNA binding protein (Chang et al., 2005; Hurst et al., 2009). The M and E proteins are both transmembrane proteins. The M protein, a 3 pass transmembrane protein is particularly significant as it is believed to be responsible for maintaining and giving the virion its shape (Armstrong et al., 1984).

Blood not only provides for a minimally-invasive, cost effective and readily accessible source of immunological sample, but whole blood stimulation also serves as the closest mimic of the in vivo condition. Single-cell Mass Cytometry (or Cytometry by Time of Flight mass spectrometry, CyTOF) is ideally suited to broad profiling of the immune system, since it allows for >40 parameter panels, with little to no spillover between channels, which is a significant advancement over the procedural limitations of fluorescence flow cytometry (Leipold et al., 2015). Conversely, cell acquisition speed is significantly lower, and cell loss significantly higher, for CyTOF compared to fluorescence flow cytometry. In this report, we show the establishment of a reference panel of 39-anti human antibodies for mass cytometry that broadly identifies the major immune cell types, well established T and B cell subpopulations, activation markers, cytolytic markers and cytokines. To characterize these immune cell lineages and their functional states, the panel of anti-human heavy metal-conjugated monoclonal antibodies was selected to target the epitopes shown in Table 3, and to be compatible with fixed whole blood samples (Fernandez and Maecker, 2015 and our unpublished data). The panel described here, comprises an almost equal number of pre-made and in-house conjugates. To build this panel, we implemented the recommended panel design guidelines for mass cytometry. Low-abundance targets were allocated to higher-sensitivity channels and antibodies were designated to channels to minimize potential spectral overlap (Takahashi et al., 2017). All antibodies in the designed panel were then titrated to best discriminate the positive population from the negative. This panel can be further customized for specific hypothesis driven studies. In addition, by integrating barcoding (Behbehani et al., 2014) within this framework, we also demonstrate the compatibility of this panel with large clinical studies, to minimize technical variability. The ability to freeze fixed blood samples is also convenient for assembly of sample sets for retrospective batched analysis, with decreased biosafety risks in the setting of infectious disease. With regard to SARS-CoV2 or other infectious agents that might be present, whole blood fixation by the method described here has not been proven to be fully inactivating. But given the known effects of fixation on viral infectivity (Möller et al., 2015), it provides an increased level of safety.

In January 2020, the causative agent of mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). This novel coronavirus was renamed as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the consequent disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Lu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). According to the daily report of the WHO, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 81961 laboratory confirmed cases and 3293 death in China. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 and fatalities around the world are 465315 and 21031, respectively, by 26^th March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020).

Bio-protocol-682	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4449	Quantitative Live Confocal Imaging in Aquilegia Floral Meristems	Live imaging, Confocal imaging, Floral meristem, Aquilegia, MorphoGraphX Background Meristems are groups of pluripotent stem cells, typically located at the tips of shoots (Steeves and Sussex, 1989). Many fundamental features of meristems are shared across all vascular plants, e.g., the maintenance of a pool of undifferentiated cells, regulated cell proliferation and expansion, and control of post-embryonic organogenesis. However, there remains a great deal of unexplored variation in meristem structure and behavior across land plants. Exploring this diversity is hampered by the reliance on common developmental techniques, such as fixed tissue sectioning and imaging, that do not allow processes such as spatial and temporal patterns of cell division and expansion to be directly observed. In model systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, genetic and molecular tools have been coupled with advancements in live imaging techniques to allow analyses of both cell behaviors and gene expression in real time. These tools have provided considerable progress in our understanding of meristem development (e.g., Prunet et al., 2016; Geng and Zhou, 2019; Shi et al., 2020; Caggiano et al., 2021; Silveira et al., 2022). However, these advancements are currently limited to a small number of model species, and there is a pressing need to develop quantitative live imaging techniques in nonmodel systems, and specifically, approaches that may be broadly practical across a range of plant taxa. Here, we present a detailed protocol for live imaging and analysis of floral meristems in Aquilegia coerulea, a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). This protocol provides a powerful tool to study the development of the meristem and initiation of floral organs, and should be easily adaptable to many plant lineages, including other emerging model systems. This protocol will allow researchers to explore questions outside the scope of common model systems.

Availability of bioluminescent bacteria and advanced imaging systems capable of acquiring bioluminescence originating from in vitro experiments or experimental animal models enable us to quickly and longitudinally evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobials. Conventional in vitro approaches, among many others, include radial diffusion and viable count assays (Balouiri et al., 2016). For in vivo evaluation, CFU (colony-forming unit) enumeration of the animal tissue is the standard practice. Although all these approaches have their own advantages, they are time-consuming as microbiological culturing protocols require 24 to 72h before results are known. In particular, in vivo evaluation requires that animals be sacrificed for each experimental time point, which renders this process laborious and longitudinal analysis unattainable.

Such assays are crucial as a first step for assessing immunological response to infection and vaccination. While it is clear that immunological responses are complex, with many factors other than circulating antibodies contributing to protection after infection and long-term immunity, the ability to rapidly monitor antibody responses allows for population surveillance and provides the foundation for other more complex studies.
Bio-protocol-831	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4300	Rhizoctonia solani Infection Assay of Young Sugar Beet and Arabidopsis plantlets	Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris, DNA, Rhizoctonia solani, RNA Background Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) is a biennial plant species grown for its high sugar content in the taproot. In temperate regions where this crop is mainly grown, it takes about six months from sowing to harvesting (Draycott, 2006). This long timespan exposes the root to several soil-borne pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia solani. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping-off disease on seedlings or root and crown rot disease on older roots, and this has developed into a major and increasing problem in sugar beet growing areas (Kluth and Varrelmann, 2010). The isolates of this fungal basidiomycete are divided into hyphal anastomosis groups (AGs). AG2-2IIIB is the subgroup that mainly incites disease on sugar beet, but such strains can also infect maize, resulting in problems where these two crops are used in the same crop rotation scheme (Führer Ithurrart et al., 2004).
Bio-protocol-832	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4299	Flow Cytometry Analysis of Planarian Stem Cells Using DNA and Mitochondrial Dyes	Planaria, Regeneration, Stem cells, Pluripotency, FACS, Mitochondria Background Fluorescent dyes that stain the nucleus in live cells are used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) proliferating stem cells from planaria. In a seminal work, Hayashi et al. used Hoechst for staining planarian cells and categorized the cells into three populations, termed as X1, X2, and Xins population (Figure 2) and (Hayashi et al., 2006). This allowed sorting of the proliferating cells (X1 cells) in the planarian field of research (Hayashi et al., 2006). Later, Hoechst stain was found to be toxic so, for downstream applications where viable cells are required, a different FACS gate X1(fs) based on forward scatter (FSC) had to be used (Wagner et al., 2011). This population was obtained by backgating the X1 population in an FSC vs SSC plot (Wang et al., 2018). However, X1(fs) is heavily contaminated by differentiated cells. Subsequently, the nuclear dye SiR-DNA was proposed as an alternative to Hoechst for obtaining proliferating stem cells with high viability (Lei et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2021). However, this flow cytometry method using a nuclear dye could not distinguish between the pluripotent and the specialized stem cell populations.

Bio-protocol-835	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4296	Fractionation and Extraction of Crude Nuclear Proteins From Arabidopsis Seedlings	Crude nuclei isolation, Nuclear protein extraction, Protocol, Arabidopsis seedlings Background The plant nucleus is the repository of a cell that regulates the genetic and biochemical machinery, therefore it is crucial to isolate the plant nuclei as source material for proteomic studies, protein expression patterns, modifications, and dynamic physiological responses (Calikowski and Meier, 2006). Nuclei isolation from different plant tissues mainly involves four steps, namely disruption, filtration, repeated centrifugation, and density gradient separation (Yin and Komatsu, 2016). Homogenization buffers are important for the stabilization of nuclei from various plant tissues. The compositions of homogenization buffers includes organic buffers (e.g., MES, HEPES, PIPES, and Tris) to stabilize the pH, inorganic salts (e.g., KCl, NaCl, and M g C l_2 ) to maintain the ionic strength of the solution, sucrose, glycerol, and hexylene glycol to stabilize membranes, polyamines (spermine and spermidine) to stabilize the nuclear chromatin and avoid the aggregation of nuclei, reducing agents  -mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol) to maintain cysteine residues in the reduced form, and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and plant protease inhibitor cocktail) to protect proteins from degradation (Yin and Komatsu, 2016). For the fact that various organelles of a cell differ in both size and density, density gradient centrifugation (also known as rate-zonal centrifugation) and differential-velocity centrifugation are widely used for the purification of different subcellular organelles (Komatsu, 2007). Percoll density gradient is often used in the fractionation and purification of nuclei from cell homogenates of Arabidopsis seedlings (Calikowski and Meier, 2006). The 2.0 M sucrose gradient method is also rapid and efficient for the isolation of nuclei from the cultured rice suspension cells (Morré and Andersson, 1994). Here, we present a simple protocol for the fractionation of the crude nuclei from Arabidopsis seedlings without density gradient centrifugation, based on the previously established methods from Calikowski and Meier (2006) and Liu et al. (2018). This method is suitable for analyzing accumulation, as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions of specific proteins under specific stress conditions (Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021). However, percoll density gradient centrifugation is recommended, if high-quality nuclear proteins are needed.

Compared to the standard chemotherapeutic approach, NPs confer several advantages as they improve drug solubility and stability, prolong drug half-lives in plasma, minimize off-target effects, and concentrate drugs at the target site (Mudshinge et al., 2011). Combining all these characteristics, some NPs have been successfully approved by the FDA or are currently in clinical trials (Dinndorf et al., 2007; Ediriwickrema and Saltzman, 2015). Despite these achievements, several details have to be considered in novel nanoparticle formulations, as most NP-based drugs have failed to improve patient outcomes. One of the most important is the relation of NPs with the tumor microenvironment (TME), which includes tumor cells, immune cells, and blood vessels (Blank et al., 2017).

Up to a third of the global human population is infected with T. gondii, making it one of the most successful parasites (Pappas et al., 2009). Several anti-parasitic compounds act by targeting the parasite mitochondrion (Alday and Doggett, 2017; Smith et al., 2021); for instance, the clinically used drug atovaquone inhibits the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) (Fry and Pudney, 1992; Pfefferkorn et al., 1993; McFadden et al., 2000).

More research is being conducted on natural killer (NK) cells, as they have minimal risk of causing neurotoxicity in autologous settings (Gong et al., 2021), graft-versus-host disease in allogenic settings (Du et al., 2021), or cytokine release syndrome in general (Du et al., 2021). Other than being relatively safe in treatment, NK cells are effective in direct killing of target cells and regulating the immune system (Vivier et al., 2011).
Bio-protocol-847	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4284	Total Nucleic Acid Extraction from Single Zebrafish Embryos for Genotyping and RNA-seq	RNA-seq, Zebrafish, Transcriptomics, Genotyping Background RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is used to probe the transcriptome of samples. It can quantify the transcript abundances of different RNAs, as well as provide information on transcript structure such as alternatively spliced isoforms. The technique is widely used in developmental biology to uncover genes that are differentially expressed between two conditions such as mutant and wild-type siblings. Originally, pooled samples of multiple embryos were used to ensure a sufficient yield for the library-making protocols. De Jong et al. (2010) developed a phenol/chloroform-based method to extract RNA from individual zebrafish. Dupret et al. (2018) modified this protocol to also allow for genotyping of the individual samples. This involves removing a section of the larval tail and using this for genotyping, while the anterior part of the embryo is used for preparation of RNA. This is only possible at certain stages, and could potentially induce injury-dependent changes in gene expression. In addition, this procedure is labour-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale up.

In many neuronal systems, it is well-accepted that heterogeneity in ion channel composition shapes neuronal responses and functions. Similar hypotheses have been made for auditory afferents based on the observation that their cell bodies are heterogeneous in their complement of ion channels and intrinsic biophysical properties (e.g., Liu et al., 2014). However, long-standing technical obstacles have hampered clear tests of these hypotheses. Patch-clamp recordings from afferent terminals are limited only to sub-populations of neurons accessible by patch electrodes (Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002; Rutherford et al., 2012). By contrast, recordings from isolated somata allow for recordings from a more representative population. However, when separated from their hair-cell partners, the somata lack the morphological markers needed for assigning them to a functional group (Davis and Liu, 2011). The techniques presented here overcome these obstacles by combining patch-clamp electrophysiology with single-cell labeling in semiintact ganglion plus epithelium preparations. The approach combines the advantages of preserving the connectivity patterns between sensory hair cells and neurons, thus allowing for associations between cell-intrinsic and functional heterogeneity. The benefits of recording from ganglion cell bodies allow for more ample sampling from a representative population of cells. Our group recently applied this method to test whether neurons with different functional properties also differ in intrinsic biophysical properties (Markowitz and Kalluri, 2020). The approach is somewhat like a cochlear slice technique described by Jagger and Housley (2003), but relies on cochlear whole mounts preparations rather than vibratome generated slices. By combining information about neuronal connectivity and intrinsic diversity, these techniques can help puzzle out how inner-ear neurons parse and encode different qualities of the sensory input.

It affects patients of all ages and is estimated to result in 200,000 hospitalizations and 15,000 deaths each year (Lau et al., 2017). PH encompasses a heterogenous group of pathologic processes that result in elevation in pulmonary arterial pressures (Simonneau et al., 2019). In all forms of PH, there is prominent vascular remodeling of the arteries of the pulmonary circulation, with thickening and contraction of the medial smooth muscle layer followed by the formation of occlusive ‘neointimal lesions’ in medium and small pulmonary arteries. These pathological changes narrow vessel lumens (Figure 1), increase pulmonary vascular resistance, and ultimately result in right heart failure and death (Humbert et al., 2018).

C. elegans GSCs are an established stem cell model that has yielded generalizable insights into many aspects of stem cell biology (Kimble and White, 1981; Baugh and Sternberg, 2006; Fielenbach and Antebi, 2008; Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009). In addition, C. elegans GSCs can be imaged in living animals using standard fluorescence microscopy techniques and without surgical manipulation. In particular, live imaging of GSC mitosis provides an opportunity to investigate the dynamics of cell division and how they are influenced by in vivo factors such as tissue organization, niche signaling, and organismal physiology. Here we describe a simple, fast, and reproducible method to immobilize C. elegans and to image and analyze GSC mitosis, while preserving animal viability, fertility, and seemingly normal GSC divisions.

This reaction is a critical step in carbon metabolism in plants and bacteria, but the enzyme is most widely studied in the context of its critical role in C_4 photosynthesis, where it is responsible for primary carbon fixation. In typical PEPC assays, the enzyme is coupled to malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which converts oxaloacetate to malate, consuming NADH, and leading to a decrease in absorbance at 340 n m . This reliable coupled assay has been used extensively to compare PEPCs from different species and to understand the consequences of post-translational modification on inhibitor binding and affinity for PEP (Janc et al., 1992; Duff et al., 1995; Blasing et al., 2000; Jacobs et al., 2008; Paulus et al., 2013). Studies where the concentration of bicarbonate is varied are more challenging, as background bicarbonate, arising from equilibration with atmospheric C O_2 , is found at concentrations above the K_m for bicarbonate (often less than 100~uM_, , preventing accurate kinetic measurements. Measuring the rate of the PEPC reaction at low bicarbonate concentrations requires that background bicarbonate be removed as much as possible, and careful gas-tight assay procedures. Accurate kinetic measurements also require determining the concentration of residual bicarbonate, allowing calculation of the correct concentration of substrate.

Recent research efforts have not only brought to light key AML driver mutations but also greatly enhanced our mechanistic understanding of how these mutations transform normal blood cells into leukaemia cells (Zeisig et al., 2012). Despite this progress, the survival rates of most AML patients have only marginally improved and remain dismal (Shallis et al., 2019).
Bio-protocol-870	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4261	Preparation of Giant Escherichia coli spheroplasts for Electrophysiological Recordings	Ion channels, E. coli spheroplast, Bacteria patch clamp, Prokaryotes, Electrophysiology Background Approximately 30% of all proteins encoded in the human body are membrane proteins (Overington et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2012; He et al., 2014). They play vital roles in regulating cellular homeostasis, neuronal activity, cell metabolism, etc. (Hille, 2001). However, eukaryotic ion channels can be challenging model systems for a variety of reasons, which makes the prokaryotic orthologs a preferred model system for many biophysical studies. In the ion channel field, proteins such as KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998; Cuello et al., 2010; Cordero-Morales et al., 2011), NaK (Shi et al., 2006) and MthK (Jiang et al., 2002 and 2020; Fan et al., 2020) have been used as model systems to gain invaluable information about the structure and function of ion channels.

The  first  focus  of  EPR  employs  pulsed  strategies  to  provide  nanometer-scale  distance measurements between two or more spin labels. While multiple pulsed techniques exist, the most common method, which is double electron-electron resonance (DEER), works by flipping the spin of one electron spin and measuring its influence on another nearby spin (Pannier et al., 2000). This information can be used incisively to measure induced conformational changes, locate binding sites, and establish quaternary structure, as well as the relative positioning of two biomolecules (Park et al., 2006; Gaffney et al., 2012; Jeschke, 2012). The other application of EPR in structural biology focuses on the relationship of protein function to site-specific dynamics. The EPR lineshape is sensitive to the tumbling rate of the paramagnetic species. Therefore, this lineshape provides information on residue specific motional rates (Hubbell et al., 1998).
Bio-protocol-874	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4257	A Nucleocapsid-based Transcomplementation Cell Culture System of SARS-CoV-2 to Recapitulate the Complete Viral Life Cycle	SARS-CoV-2, trVLP, Reverse genetics, BSL-2, Nucleocapsid, Transcomplementation Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 still rages around the world, threatening public health and the global economy (Wang et al., 2020). Several reverse genetic systems have been reported for generating SARS-CoV-2 replicons and recombinant virus for basic virology research and antiviral development (Hou et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a and 2021b). However, as SARS-CoV-2 is classified as BSL-3 pathogen, experiments involving authentic virus are restricted to BSL-3 laboratories, which hinders basic research and antiviral discovery. Pseudotyped virus and replicon systems of SARS-CoV-2 that can be used in BSL-2 laboratories have been developed but are limited to studying viral entry and replication, respectively (Nie et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021b). Therefore, a cell culture model for SARS-CoV-2 that could safely recapitulate the entire viral life cycle in a BSL-2 facility is urgently needed (Rome and Avorn, 2020).

Bio-protocol-879	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4252	Non-invasive Imaging of Rice Roots in Non-compacted and Compacted Soil	Soil, Root, Computed tomography, Soil compaction, Rice Background Soil compaction is an increasingly challenging problem for modern farming, as it deforms the physical, chemical, and biological properties of agricultural soil. Modern agriculture practices rely on the use of large and heavy machinery such as tractors and harvesters. These modern practices compress both top- and sub-soil (Keller et al., 2019). Hard (compacted) soils represent a major challenge facing modern agriculture that can reduce crop yields by over 50% through reducing root growth, causing significant losses annually. Soil compaction triggers a reduction in root penetration and uptake of water and nutrients. Despite its clear importance for agriculture and global food security, the mechanism underpinning root compaction responses has been unclear until now. Imaging root adaptive responses in natural soil conditions can provide invaluable and critical responses of rhizosphere biology. Previously, most soil compaction studies did not adopt an integrated approach to image the growing roots from cellular to plant organ scales. More generally, this integrated imaging approach can be applied to other root-soil related stress responses. This protocol is applicable to image the root tip responses of several crop species, including both monocot and dicotyledonous plants in mechanical impedance stress or other edaphic stresses. So far, we have tested this protocol on the roots of rice, wheat, barley, brachypodium, pearl millet, foxtail millet, maize, and tomato plants growing in soil.

In this manuscript, we concentrate our analysis on the RNA-binding protein TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) due to its role in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases (Prasad et al., 2019; Boer et al., 2021), and describe a protocol to isolate TDP-43-binding mRNA and protein complexes in a cell type (Godena et al., 2011; Romano et al., 2014 and 2020). This methodology is reproducible, relatively costless, and details the passages needed to immunoprecipitate TDP-43 from Drosophila melanogaster neurons and detect the messenger RNA molecules (mRNA), which are able to interact with its RNA-binding domain in vivo. A complementary procedure is also described to separate TDP-43/RBPs protein complexes and identify additional interactors. In addition, we indicate how the powerful genetic tools available in D_ . melanogaster enable the possibility to study the assembly of RBP complexes in different genetic backgrounds and/or alternative developmental stages, including adulthood and aging. This scope is achieved by utilizing the amenable GAL4/UAS system, which allows the expression of any gene of interest in D. melanogaster, making our approach distinctive and particularly efficient to isolate RBP/mRNA protein combinations in previously inaccessible compartments. In addition, this protocol can be adapted to different experimental models by simply adjusting reagents, concentrations, or proportions accordingly to the ratios described. Finally, we indicate how the material can be safely stored and successively analyzed at whatever time.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus, and two lentiviruses – human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) – are commonly used as viral vectors for pseudotyping (Takada et al., 1997; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998; Sharkey et al., 2001; Negrete et al., 2005; Grehan et al., 2015; Thakur et al., 2021). In our recent study, we successfully used a lentiviral-based system to study the interaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein with its cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Conceicao et al., 2020).
Bio-protocol-883	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4248	Quantitative Determination of Primary Cilia Protein Distribution Using Immunofluorescence Staining and MATLAB Analysis	Cilia, Immunofluorescence, Imaging, Quantification, Acetylated tubulin, Arl13B Background Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory organelles that function as antenna-like structures emerging from the cell body. They detect mechanical and chemical signals from the environment and are involved in a range of biological processes critical for homeostasis (Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Anvarian et al., 2019). Not surprisingly, genetic cilia defects result in various clinical manifestations, called ciliopathies (Goetz and Anderson, 2010). Interestingly, the ciliary membrane hosts unique receptors and effector molecules that control a number of signaling pathways and biological processes. These include oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α), and Gprotein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as smoothened (SMO) (Christensen et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2015).

It is still challenging to decipher the logic of complex neuronal networks and molecular underpinnings of memory, which highlights the requirement for conditional gene perturbation in the heterogeneous brain with precise spatial and temporal resolution. A conditional recombination system has been broadly applied to investigate brain function with spatiotemporal accuracy, but the construction of germlinemodified mutant strains can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially for transgenic rats.

Bio-protocol-899	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4232	Live Imaging of Apoptotic Extrusion and Quantification of Apical Extrusion in Epithelial Cells Kinga Duszyc1, *, Ivar Noordstra1, Alpha S. Yap1 and Guillermo A. Gomez1,	Epithelia, Apoptosis, Apoptotic extrusion, Apical extrusion, Laser injury Background Epithelial tissues rely on effective extrusion to eliminate apoptotic cells for the preservation of tissue barriers and to prevent inflammation. As homeostatic apoptosis is a relatively sporadic event in healthy cultured epithelia, apoptosis needs to be experimentally induced to reliably visualise the extrusion phenomenon. This may be achieved by a variety of methods, including exposure to UV radiation (Rosenblatt et al., 2001; Slattum et al., 2009; Andrade and Rosenblatt, 2011), treatment with various chemicals e.g., Etoposide (Andrade and Rosenblatt, 2011; Michael et al., 2016; Teo et al., 2020), Camptothecin (Andrade and Rosenblatt, 2011), or activation of Fas receptors (Andrade and Rosenblatt, 2011). However, most commonly used approaches rely on randomly-induced apoptosis, making it challenging to capture high quality images with high temporal resolution to characterise dynamically progressing extrusion events. The protocol presented here describes induction of apoptosis in pre-selected cells of choice, thus allowing continuous high-quality imaging of apoptotic extrusion from induction of cell death to completion of extrusion. The following protocol may be adopted to selectively induce apoptosis in other models e.g., Zebrafish periderm (Duszyc et al., 2021) and can also be used for detailed analysis of the behaviour of neighbouring cells during the extrusion process by selectively labelling neighbours with genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (Duszyc et al., 2021).
Bio-protocol-900	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4231	Measurement of Bone Metastatic Tumor Growth by a Tibial Tumorigenesis Assay	Bone metastasis, Mouse model, Tibial injection, Prostate cancer, Tumorigenesis, Osteolysis Background Bone metastasis is the most frequent metastasis for many cancer types, especially for those arising from prostate (90%) , breast (70%) , multiple myeloma (90%) , lung (40%) , and kidney (40%) (Coleman, 2006). The median survival of patients with bone metastasis ranges from approximately one year for lung cancer to 3-5 years for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma (Campbell et al., 2012). Bone metastases often require radiotherapy and lead to bone pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fracture, and spinal cord or nerve root compression (Coleman, 2006). Bone metastases also develop resistance to chemotherapy, as docetaxel-treated prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis still have poor prognoses (Coleman et al., 2020). Therefore, effective therapeutic strategies are still urgently needed for bone metastatic cancer patients.

Unstable proteins undergo either proteasomal or vacuolar degradation. Thus, the physiological relevance of protein turnover can be deciphered by blocking the proteasome, the vacuolar proteases, or by using stable mutant variants thereof. To bypass the need for antibodies binding specifically to it, tagged versions of the protein of interest can be constructed and expressed.
Bio-protocol-907	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4224	Knockoff: Druggable Cleavage of Membrane Proteins	Knockoff, Degron, Protease, Protein degradation, Membrane proteins Background Removing a protein from a biological system is a common approach in the study of its function. Traditionally, this removal has been achieved through deletion of the gene encoding the protein of interest (POI), which prevents new copies of the protein from being made. However, drawbacks to this technique limit its usefulness. Constitutive genetic knockouts necessitate the development of an organism without the POI and may promote compensatory mechanisms, thus confounding any observed phenotype. Some control can be achieved through application of a Cre-lox system. This system uses a sequence-specific recombinase (Cre) to allow for a time-controllable genetic knockout (Sauer, 1987). Yet, this system still functions on the genetic level, which leaves the researcher at the mercy of the natural half-life of their POI. Indeed, half-lives of many presynaptic proteins range from many days to over a week (Dörrbaum et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-908	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4223	Isolation of Primary Leydig Cells from Murine Testis	Primary Leydig cell, Testis, Testosterone, Collagenase IV, Late-onset Hypogonadism Background Leydig cells, located in the interstitial tissue of testis, are steroidogenic cells that contribute to testosterone synthesis and secretion. Leydig cell steroidogenesis is strictly regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland. LH binds luteinizing hormone receptor (LHCGR) located on the surface of Leydig cells to activate adenylyl cyclase and increase the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP signaling cascade stimulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which transports cholesterol from cytoplasm into the inner membrane of mitochondria. Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by a P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) and translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, pregnenolone is converted to testosterone by a series of lyase reactions. Male hypogonadism is characterized by testosterone deficiency and affects approximately 6% of males, with an increasing incidence and prevalence in recent years. However, the mechanisms of testosterone deficiency are far from clear. Immortalized cell lines provide useful tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying testosterone deficiency. Characterized Leydig cell lines, such as MA-10, BLTK1, and TM3 (Engeli et al., 2018), are unable to produce testosterone due to a lack or low expression of testosterone synthase genes. In contrast, the expression level of these genes in primary Leydig cells is closer to the cells in vivo. Furthermore, primary Leydig cells feature a complete signaling pathway of testosterone synthesis and are widely used to investigate late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) and diseases of the reproductive system. Additionally, Leydig cell and stem Leydig cell transplantation have been developed as alternative therapies for the treatment of testicular damage, LOH, and sexual dysfunction, achieving good curative effects (Artyukhin et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2014). Therefore, procedures for isolation and enrichment of Leydig cells from testes are vital for establishing the role of Leydig cells in hypogonadism. In recent years, various approaches have been used to isolate Leydig cells, but gradient centrifugation is the most frequently used (Conn et al., 1977; Gale et al., 1982). Therefore, these methods are complicated, costly, time-consuming, and provide low yield. Here, we describe a cost-effective and time-saving protocol for isolating Leydig cells via digestion with collagenase VI.

Multiple-tool biofabrication techniques overcome this limitation by making it is possible to generate ‘print-and-implant’ devices to deliver growth factors with distinct spatiotemporal release profiles to enhance tissue regeneration. Specifically, for bone healing, several growth factors have been shown to be expressed at different phases of healing, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This protocol describes in detail how we developed a bioinks that interact with the growth factors to make it possible to tightly control the location and timing of their release in vivo, thereby negating the need for supraphysiological doses.

Tregs inhibit the action of many immune cells, including effector T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC), via cell contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms. The suppressive function of Tregs is typically assessed in vitro by measuring their ability to inhibit the proliferation of polyclonally stimulated T cells. However, methods to measure how Tregs suppress APCs are limited.

Bio-protocol-916	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4215	Whole-mount Staining of Mouse Diaphragm Neuromuscular Junctions	Whole-mount staining, Diaphragm, NMJ, Immunofluorescence Background The mammalian diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. It is composed of two parts: the costal and crural diaphragm segments (Merrell and Kardon, 2013). neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized structure on the diaphragm, consisting of presynaptic nerve terminals and postsynaptic muscle membranes (Li et al., 2018). With the development of the mouse embryos, NMJ gradually gathers in the middle area of the diaphragm myofibers. In adult mice, each contractile diaphragm myofiber is precisely dominated by a motor neuron terminal at the middle region (Liu and Chakkalakal, 2018). When motoneuron terminals release acetylcholine (ACh), the latter activates its receptors (AChRs) located on muscle fibers and causes muscle contraction (Li et al., 2018). Defects in the development and maintenance of NMJ can lead to a variety of neuromuscular diseases (Arimura et al., 2014). Because of the particularity of its structure, diaphragms are frequently used to study NMJ formation. The embryonic and neonatal mouse diaphragms are thin and easy to stain. However, adult diaphragms become thicker and are covered with connective tissues, and are difficult for immunostaining. In this article, we provide a simple and detailed protocol that can be used for the isolation of diaphragms from embryonic, neonatal, and adult mice, and for diaphragm NMJ staining.

Bio-protocol-919	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4212	Enrichment of Cytoplasmic RNA Granules from Arabidopsis Seedlings	RNA granule, Stress granule, siRNA body, Transposon, DDM1 Background RNA granules (RGs) are non-membraneous cellular architectures that are relevant to a variety of biological processes. Of these, stress granules (SGs) contain non-translating mRNAs and various RNA-binding proteins, and serve as the assorting sites of mRNAs for storage, translational reinitiation, or degradation (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009). Recently, we demonstrated that plant SGs include numerous transposon RNAs in DNA methylation-deficient mutants (Kim et al., 2021). Being natural endogenous mutagens in genomes, transposons are counteracted by the host’s epigenetic silencing mechanisms, which are primarily mediated by siRNAs. Several studies have suggested that transposon-derived siRNAs are produced in the siRNA bodies, which are often in association with SGs (McCue et al., 2012 and 2013). The transcriptome of SGs in yeast and human have been characterized in detail (Jain et al., 2016; Khong et al., 2017), revealing that SG-located RNAs are depleted of ribosomes and relatively longer in length. Consistently, our latest work also showed for the first time in a plant system that SGs contain weakly translating RNAs, the majority of which are derived from transposons (Kim et al., 2021). Given the importance and prevalence of RGs in a wide variety of biological processes, the identification of their RNA and protein components is a critical first step towards understanding RG-mediated gene expression control. Therefore, we describe here a versatile method for the enrichment of the RGs from Arabidopsis seedlings.
Bio-protocol-920	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4211	Histone Modification ChIP-seq on Arabidopsis thaliana Plantlets	Chromatin, Immunoprecipitation, ChIP-seq, Histone, Arabidopsis thaliana Background  In  eukaryotes,  particular  histone  modifications  can  be  associated  with  specific transcriptional status (Dong and Weng, 2013). Thus, integrating data on chromatin modification patterns with the transcriptional landscape of specific genotypes and tissues, as well as in response to treatments, can contribute with valuable information for the prediction of transcriptional networks regulating a plethora of physiological processes. ChIP-seq exploits the high specificity of immunoassays with the high-throughput nature of next-generation sequencing (NGS), representing a robust, replicable, and cost-effective technique. This method has been equally adapted for the identification of genomic targets of chromatin-interacting proteins, including transcription factors, allowing expanding its applications to practically any research field of biological sciences.

However, this response is easily influenced by the surrounding environment. To make the data reliable for scientific research, it is necessary to set up a device to test the response more accurately. Previous research has showed that the preference of insects in response to volatile compounds can be tested by a Y tube (Adhikary et al., 2014; Ndomo-Moualeu et al., 2016). Here, we provide a schematic representation of a choice test system to check the behavior of insects affected by volatile DMNT or other compounds released from different samples.

Bio-protocol-925	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4206	Measuring Real-time DNA/RNA Nuclease Activity through Fluorescence	Nuclease assay, RNA, DNA, Biochemistry, Catalytic activity Background Nucleases are enzymes that act on DNA and RNA by cleaving the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides. In addition to their crucial role in the DNA repair machinery, they are involved in cell signalling pathways pertinent to DNA damage and immune responses, among others (Sheppard et al., 2018). Their complex roles support several premature ageing-, immune-, and tumour-related processes. All of these can suffer from aberrations in the structural and/or catalytic functions of DNA and RNA nucleases (reviewed in Bartosova et al., 2014; Rigby et al., 2015). The growing interest in understanding the activities of numerous human DNA nucleases that remain contentious e.g., Mre11 (Paull and Deshpande, 2014) and CTIP (Mozaffari et al., 2021) and the presence of several uncharacterised proteins with predicted nuclease domains in mammalian genomes led us to design a real-time nuclease assay.
Bio-protocol-926	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4205	Lentivirus-mediated Conditional Gene Expression	NLR, NOD1, Lentivirus, Stable expression, TRE, Tetracycline Background A crucial technique for studying functional responses in molecular biology is the ability to regulate the expression of a gene. Constitutive gene expression systems have allowed researchers to explore gene responses only if prolonged overexpression is non-toxic. Such systems can also lead to the development of compensatory mechanisms within a cell that can mask functional phenotypes (ElBrolosy et al., 2019). Inducible expression systems are a favored alternative to constitutive expression, giving researchers the ability to switch genes on and off or titrate the level of gene expression, with fewer side effects and greater efficiency. One advantage of such conditional expression is the ability to regulate gene expression in a quantitative, temporally-regulated, and reversible manner that more accurately reveals the direct result of a given genetic change. The tetracycline-controlled operator system containing the TRE promoter provides reversible gene expression with a large induction range at low concentrations of a drug that is non-toxic to mammalian cells. The TRE promoter contains a modified Tet response element consisting of seven repeats of a 36-nt sequence that contains the 19-bp Tet operator sequence (TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGA). This Tet response element is positioned upstream of a minimal CMV promoter sequence, which lacks the enhancer present in the native CMV promoter. Consequently, the TRE promoter is silent in the absence of binding of the tetracycline responsive rtTA3 regulatory protein. Advances in the system have optimized the reverse Tet transactivator (rtTA) component for improved drug sensitivity and activity and, more importantly, to show no activity in the absence of tetracycline or doxycycline (DOX, a tetracycline analog), thus reducing the leakage of the system (Zhou et al., 2006; Yamada et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it should be noted that tetracycline-derived contaminants are often present in cell culture sera; this poses a challenge for Tetbased systems, but this issue can be avoided by using tetracycline-free serum.

Improving the efficiency of the RuBisCO carboxylation activity might increase the yield of produced biomass and drive cost-effective, ecologically friendly ways to biosynthesize diverse carbon-based compounds (Simkin et al., 2019; Kubis et al., 2019). Therefore, RuBisCO has become one of the most extensively studied and engineered enzymes (Bainbridge et al., 1995; Whitney et al., 2011). Different approaches have been utilized to manipulate the total activity of RuBisCO, such as improving its activation by activases (Bhat et al., 2017), incorporating beneficial mutations in the enzyme substrate-binding or active sites (Andersson, 2008), and upregulating RuBisCO expression (Parry et al., 2003; Carmo-Silva et al., 2015; Liang and Lindblad, 2017; Salesse-Smith et al., 2018; Durall et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021), as well genomically replacing the native RuBisCO with its ancient counterpart (Kedzior et al., 2021).
Bio-protocol-933	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4198	A Rapid Induction Overexpression System for the Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe	Thiamine-induced, Overexpression, lncRNA-regulation, Fission yeast Background  Overexpression  is  a  useful  tool  to  study  gene  function.  In  the  fission  yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, many such tools exist, but each system has some disadvantages, including slow induction kinetics, narrow dynamic range, induction-based growth arrest, stress and/or system-wide  transcriptional  changes,  self-limiting  gene  expression,  and  requirement  of  strain construction (addressed in Garg, 2020). The thiamine-repressed nmt calI^+ promoter is the most popular regulatable system used in fission yeast (Forsburg, 1993). This promoter system has a fast rate of repression but takes 14-20~h~ to induce mRNA expression (Maundrell, 1990). To transcend the limits of existing systems, I had designed the pTIN-system (Garg, 2020). Here, the n m t1^+ promoter directs synthesis of the nc-tgp1 lncRNA, which is 5' -adjacent to the tgp  I^+ promoter. The tgp I^+ promoter in turn guides the synthesis of the gene of interest (GOI). In thiamine-starved conditions, lncRNA transcription interferes with the tgp calI^+ promoter and represses expression of the GOI. Inclusion of thiamine shuts off lncRNA synthesis and allows GOI expression. The pTIN-overexpression system has (i) rapid induction with maximal mRNA expression within an hour after the addition of thiamine, (ii) 60-fold dynamic range, and (iii) tunable expression by varying thiamine concentration in the medium (Garg, 2020). This protocol describes the utilization of the pTIN-system.

Mutations in the polycystin proteins PC-1 or PC-2 are the major cause of ADPKD, resulting in renal cysts and numerous extra-renal manifestations (Torres et al., 2007). The polycystin complex is a heteromeric channel complex consisting of PC-1 and PC-2 subunits in a 1:3 ratio (Su et al., 2018). Direct recordings from primary cilia (ciliary patch clamp) of mouse Inner Medullary Collecting Duct-3 (IMCD-3) cells have shown that the polycystin complex is the dominant ion channel complex to permeate cations (Icilium) across the ciliary membrane (Kleene and Kleene, 2017; Liu et al., 2018). We and others recently developed novel electrophysiological methods to measure ion channel activity in this tiny, previously inaccessible organelle (Kleene and Kleene, 2012; DeCaen et al., 2013; Ha et al., 2020). The volume ratio of cilioplasm to cytoplasm is approximately 1:30,000, suggesting that a much smaller pipette tip is required to make a tight seal on the ciliary membrane (Delling et al., 2013). In this manuscript, we provide useful tips to perform the ciliary patch clamp technique for students and scientists who want to investigate ciliary ion channels.

Since then, a vast majority of the existing information about the physiological and molecular processes surrounding capacitation was obtained using in vitro systems, which were first used in the 1970s for the conception of the first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Steptoe and Edwards, 1976). Nowadays, up to 10% of children in developed countries are conceived by assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). With this development, there is an even greater need to obtain detailed knowledge about the natural capacitation process and to understand its differences from in vitro capacitation. This protocol enables researchers to study the molecular features of sperm at the different stages of the capacitation process by isolating sperm from different locations along the reproductive tract (UTJ, isthmus, and ampulla) of time-mated female mice. This protocol can also be applied to recover freshly ejaculated sperm from mice (Li et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2017) as epididymal sperm are normally used for mouse experiments, as opposed to ejaculate sperm for large domestic animals or humans.
Bio-protocol-939	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4192	Isolation and Culturing Primary Cholangiocytes from Mouse Liver	Cholangiocytes, Cholestasis, Biliary injury, Primary sclerosing cholangitis, Biliary atresia Background The liver is structurally and functionally heterogeneous. It performs vital functions like the uptake of cholesterol; amino acid, lipid, and vitamin metabolism; and the production of albumin and blood clotting factors. The liver is composed of parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, of which hepatocytes form a major portion; other cells present include biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes), stellate cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and various immune cell subsets (Zorn, 2008). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells form a lining between the blood in the sinusoidal space and underlying hepatocytes, forming the space of Disse. Liver lobules are functional units that have a central vein from which hepatocyte cords arise and are separated into sinusoids carrying blood from the portal triad to the central vein. Portal triads are composed of the hepatic artery, bile duct, and portal vein. Bile ducts are lined by epithelial cells called cholangiocytes (Malarkey et al., 2005; Gordillo et al., 2015), as shown in Figure 1. The biliary epithelium primarily acts as a lining conduit for bile flow, but it also modifies canalicular bile and concentrates bile in the gall bladder. Biliary epithelia are “effective communicators” with neighboring cells in producing mediators that are involved in cell growth and injury response (Chen et al., 2008). Many risk factors, including genetic mutations, immune-mediated damage, idiopathic factors, infectious agents including viruses, and vascular defects, can modify cholangiocyte physiology, resulting in altered bile transport leading to cholestasis, which further induces inflammation, fibrosis, and

Now, it is recognized as a complex and essential organ for  mammalian  reproduction,  as  aberrations  in  its  formation  and/or  function  have  immediate consequences on pregnancy outcomes, as well as lifelong impacts on the health of the offspring (Malhotra et al., 2019). At term, the placenta has a discoid shape, with one side facing the amniotic cavity (the chorionic plate) and the other in contact with the endometrium (the decidual plate). Its microstructure is formed of villi that could be compared to multiple trees, which come from the branches of the fetal arteries (Turco and Moffett, 2019). Since these villi are directly in contact with the maternal blood, the human placenta is told hemochorial (Foidart et al., 1992). The interface between the maternal blood and the fetal vessels is called the syncytium. This unique layer constitutes the functional unit of the placenta and comes from the fusion of the mononuclear villous cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) to form multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs). This process, known as syncytialization, takes place throughout the pregnancy and is critical for the formation and the functions of the placenta (Costa, 2016). On the other hand, the CTBs can also stay mononuclear but acquire an invasive capacity, especially during the first trimester. In this case, they are called extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and are crucial to the adaptations of the maternal arteries to pregnancy (Chang et al., 2018). In both cases, the study of CTBs differentiation represents one of the keys to improve our understanding of placental development

Bio-protocol-948	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4183	Phalloidin Staining of Actin Filaments for Visualization of Muscle Fibers in	Phalloidin, C. elegans, Actin, Muscle fibers, Cytoskeleton, Nucleus, Muscle disease, Aging Background In the last decades, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a powerful model organism and has provided an unprecedented opportunity to expand our knowledge in different fields of research, from developmental biology (Mello et al., 1992; Bowerman et al., 1993; Hubbard and Greenstein, 2000), to neuromuscular degeneration (Braungart et al., 2004; McColl et al., 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2017; Romani et al., 2021) and aging (Kimura et al., 1997; Herndon et al., 2002). One of the main reasons that promoted the usage of C. elegans as a laboratory model is that despite its simplicity, it has defined tissues. In particular, it consists of five main tissues: epidermis, reproductive tissues, digestive system, nervous system, and muscle tissue (Spencer et al., 2011). Among these, muscle tissue morphology and function have been widely used to typify C. elegans fitness and healthspan (Fire et al., 1991; Ryu et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2017; D’Amico et al., 2019; Romani et al., 2021). In recent years, numerous protocols have emerged to facilitate the visualization of C. elegans muscles, taking advantage of the transparent nature of this nematode. Phalloidin is a mushroom-derived molecule that specifically binds filamentous actin (F-actin); hence, phalloidin derivatives tagged with fluorescent molecules are commonly used in microscopy to visualize F-actin in different fields of research (Chazotte, 2010). Body wall muscles of the nematode C. elegans possess obliquely striated myofibrils composed of highly organized filaments of actin, whose disposition is altered in pathological conditions (Gieseler et al., 2018). For this reason, phalloidin-based staining of actin filaments has been successfully implemented in nematodes for the detection of cytoskeleton and muscle structure, with important applications in muscle disease and degeneration (Gieseler et al., 2018). However, phalloidinbased protocols typically rely on tedious fixation steps using harmful compounds, such as PFA, and require the preparation of specific, complicated buffers (Costa et al., 1997; Ono, 2001; Bansal et al., 2015; Geisler et al., 2020). We present here a method for C. elegans research that allows phalloidin staining of actin filaments, bypassing fixation, and using conventional buffers. Moreover, by integrating 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining in our protocol, we allow the visualization of muscle cell nuclei, whose morphology can be used to interpret cellular homeostasis. Finally, our protocol requires a limited amount of worms and can be suspended at different steps, ensuring a versatile experimental procedure. Overall, our methodology provides a robust, simple, and safer pipeline for the visualization of muscle fibers and nuclei in C. elegans with applications in multiple fields of biomedical research. We predict that this protocol could be coupled with additional dyes specific for other tissues or cellular components, such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, allowing an even broader overview of worm physiology and homeostasis.

The GI tract is constantly exposed to commensal, opportunistic, and pathogenic microbes, creating perturbations that can lead to life-threatening infections and chronic inflammation. The host defense system in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is comprised of a single layer epithelium fortified with adjoining cells and lymphoid tissues that operate efficiently to maintain barrier homeostasis. This barrier strikes a balance of remaining tolerant to commensal microbes and dietary antigens while preserving the capacity to mount an inflammatory response against pathogens.
Bio-protocol-950	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4181	Dark Respiration Measurement from Arabidopsis Shoots	NFS1, Dark respiration, C O_2 , Mitochondria, Flux Background Plants produce energy in the form of ATP from glucose oxidation through mitochondrial respiration (Glucose ^+ oxygen = carbon dioxide ^+ water). In order to differentiate from photorespiration inherent to photosynthesis, dark respiration measurements are made in the absence of light (Graham, 1980). Mitochondria are essential organelles involved in energy production, amino acid biosynthesis, iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster cofactor biosynthesis, and other metabolic pathways that affect growth and stress  responses  (Lill,  2009).  We  identified  two  mitochondria-localized  Fe-S  cluster  proteins, NITROGEN FIXATION S-LIKE1 (NFS1) and its interactor FRATAXIN (FH), as novel players in plant defense responses (Fonseca et al., 2020). In the current manuscript, we describe the methods used in this previous research to test a possible effect of the nfs1 and fh mutants, and overexpression lines, on mitochondrial respiration using measurements of dark respiration of the entire shoot and root. This simple protocol can be performed using plants grown entirely in controlled conditions in growth chambers. It involves the flux measurement of the dark respiration by-product C O_2 from tissues in small airtight chambers, using an Ll-850 C O_2/H_2O gas analyzer (LICOR) in a dark room with a supplemental photosynthetically inactive yellow LED light. The C O_2 flux for each plant is measured during a 2 min 30 s interval using the software LI-8x0 v1.02 (LICOR). Specific shoot and root respiration rates (nmol C O_2 gfw- epsilon^1eqepsilon^-1 ) are calculated from the raw C O_2 flux data using R (v.3.6.0; https://www.r-project.org/), where linear regression is used to calculate the C O_2 flux rate with the dead band set at 60s , and then divided by total shoot fresh weight.
Bio-protocol-951	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4180	A High-throughput Pipeline to Determine DNA and Nucleosome Conformations	Atomic force microscopy, AFM, DNA, Nucleosome, Image analysis Background Nucleosomes are the basic units of compaction of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin and function as regulators of gene readout and activity (Bowman and Poirier, 2015; Sadakierska-Chudy and Filip, 2015; Baldi et al., 2020). Canonical nucleosome core particles consist of two copies each of the four histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 assembled into a histone octamer that is tightly wrapped by 147 bp of DNA (Luger et al., 1997; Richmond and Davey, 2003). Accessibility to the genetic code for readout and processing is facilitated by (partial) unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA and can be achieved either by active processes involving, e.g., RNA polymerase or nucleosome chaperones that exert forces and torques on the nucleosomes (Sirinakis et al., 2011; Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013; Narlikar et al., 2013; Ordu et al., 2016), or spontaneously by thermal fluctuations (Li and Widom, 2004). Using singlemolecule micromanipulation techniques such as optical tweezers, the energetics of force-induced nucleosome unwrapping has been probed at high resolution (Mihardja et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2009; Schlingman et al., 2014; Ngo et al., 2015; Kaczmarczyk et al., 2020). However, the unwrapping landscape in the absence of force has been more difficult to access.
Bio-protocol-952	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4179	Isolation, Culture, and Identification of Primary Müller Cells from Human Retina	Müller cell, Retina, Human, Primary culture Background Müller cells, the principal macroglial cells of the vertebrate retina, are responsible for retinal redox homeostasis and provide metabolic support for retinal neurons (Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2013). Müller cells are also a promising target for therapeutic regeneration (Ahmad et al., 2011). An immortalized human Müller cell line (MIO-M1) was characterized in 2002 and has been widely used as an in vitro model to study human Müller cells (Limb et al., 2002). Primary cultures of human cells may offer a more appropriate in vitro model than immortalized cell lines for single-cell studies (Schnichels, 2020). The use of human primary Müller cells (huPMCs) in culture has been limited by the requirement for complicated culture systems (Giannelli et al., 2011) or particular age ranges of donors (Lupien and Salesse, 2007). Human retina tissue from donors cultured using our modified protocol was refrigerated overnight in the dark before digestion. The tissue was then cut into small pieces and firmly pressed to the base of the cell culture flask. These pieces were cultured with a minimum amount of medium for a week then provided with a regular amount of medium. Cell colonies emerged after culturing for two to three weeks in donors from almost all age groups. Our culture system does not require growth factors or Matrigel. Firmly pressing retina tissue to the base of the flask greatly increased the success rate, even in donor samples where the post-mortem time exceeded ^24h . We have successfully detected the following Müller cell markers: CRALBP, VIMENTIN, SOX2, GS, and AQP4.

The use of centrifugation for the preparation of colloidal chitin (CC) and cell free supernatant (CFS) has limitations as a large volume of liquids are involved (Hsu and Lockwood, 1975; Mitsutomi et al., 1995). Preparation of CFS from lab-scale and pilot-scale fermented broth is particularly challenging (Sarkar et al., 2010). Thus, a large capacity centrifuge machine (preferably refrigerated) with suitable rotor must be used (e.g., Sorvall BIOS 16). These facilities may not be available to researchers, especially in developing countries. Under these circumstances, filtration can be a viable alternative to centrifugation.
Bio-protocol-956	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4175	Measuring Total Classical Pathway and Activities of Individual Components of the Mouse	Complement, Haemolytic, Assay, Classical, CH50, Depleted sera, Mouse Background Complement comprises more than 30 plasma and membrane-bound proteins that interact to induce a series of inflammatory responses to defend against infection, prime innate immunity and modulate adaptive responses. The complement cascade is activated by three pathways: classical (CP), lectin and alternative (Morgan et al., 2015; Zelek et al., 2019a). The CP was the first to be discovered when investigating the bacterolytic properties of serum in the 19^th century. More recent studies have shown that the complement cascade is functionally and structurally conserved in mammals, with the majority of components working across species (Slodkowicz et al., 2020; Moleón et al., 2006). CP is triggered by antigen-bound antibodies on surfaces; C1 binds and initiates a cascade with sequential generation of the CP C3 convertase C4b2a and C5 convertase C4b2a3b. The C5 convertase cleaves C5, releasing the C5a anaphylatoxin and initiating the terminal pathway through C5b; this binds C6 and C7, and the trimolecular C5b-7 complex attaches to the target surface. C8 and multiple copies of C9 are recruited to build a transmembrane pore (Podack et al., 1984; Serna et al., 2016; Menny et al., 2018). The complement system evolved to protect from pathogens; however, over-activation of complement drives inflammation in many diseases, including renal, autoimmune and neurological diseases (Zelek et al., 2019a; Carpanini et al., 2019). Emerging evidence of roles of complement activation in diverse diseases has triggered an explosion of interest in developing new complement targeting drugs and generated a need for testing in animal models. It is therefore important to have simple and robust assays measuring complement activity in rodents and other model species. Although the traditional CH50 assay, developed more than 70 years ago (Rice et al., 1952; Mayer et al., 1967), is well respected and used in research and clinical settings to measure human complement activity, its application for measuring mouse complement is limited because the “classical” targets, antibodysensitised sheep erythrocytes (ShEA), are poor activators of mouse complement necessitating the use of high amounts of mouse serum required (typically, 25-50% concentration in assay). The utility of the assay for mouse can be improved by inclusion of an additional sensitisation step, incubating the ShEA with mouse anti-rabbit IgG, but serum requirement remains high (Zelek et al., 2019b) (Figure 1).

In contrast to conventional research animal models (e.g., mice and rats), zebrafish embryos are small 1-3 m m) , optically transparent, and readily available in large numbers. These features enable real-time visualization of nanoparticle injected doses using simple fluorescence microscopy setups, at cellular resolution, and over large sample sets. In addition, the extensive range of fluorescent transgenic lines e.g., mpeg1:GFP (Ellett et al., 2011), macrophages;  kdrl:GFP  (Jin  et  al.,  2005),  endothelial  cells,  short  generational  timeframes (approximately 3 months), and the ease of genetic manipulation (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing) (Suster et al., 2009; Varshney et al., 2015), facilitates mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle fate in vivo. Crucially, key biological mechanisms underpinning nanoparticle behavior in higher order vertebrates (e.g., rodents and humans) are conserved and functional in zebrafish embryos. In particular, the embryonic zebrafish can accurately predict nanoparticle interactions within the mammalian liver (Campbell et al., 2018; Arias-Alpizar et al., 2021). These interactions account for the (unwanted) Copyright  2021 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC. 2 clearance of up to 99% of systemically administered nanoparticles (Zhang et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-960	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4171	Analysis of Leukemia Cell Metabolism through Stable Isotope Tracing in Mice	Cell metabolism, Metabolic tracing, Cancer biology, Mouse models, Leukemia, Glutamine Background Unraveling the molecular regulation of cancer cells is critical to understand their insurgence, functioning, and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. A dysregulated cellular metabolism is now widely accepted as a hallmark of many cancers (DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016). Cancer cells display considerably different metabolic requirements compared to most normal differentiated cells and reprogram pathways controlling nutrient acquisition and metabolism to meet their specific bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and redox demands. Emerging evidence, mostly from solid tumors, shows that several metabolic characteristics of cancer cells can also be linked to therapeutic resistance (Zhao et al., 2013). Metabolic heterogeneity between cells, driven by genetic, cell state, or microenvironmental diversity, may further allow subpopulations of cells to escape therapy-related cell death (Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2016).

They were first discovered in viroids four decades ago (Sanger et al., 1976). Recently, many studies showed that circRNAs were widely present in eukaryotes and expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015; Chen, 2020). Several types of circRNAs are found in cells, including exonic circRNA, EIciRNA, and ciRNA (Kristensen et al., 2019); however, the majority of them are exonic circRNAs that are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs (Salzman et al., 2012 and 2013; Memczak et al., 2013; Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Zhang, X. O. et al., 2014). Thus, most exonic circRNAs sequences are the same as those of linear mRNAs, and the back-splicing junctions are unique sequences for circRNA detection.
Bio-protocol-965	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4166	Inter-species Transplantation of Blastocysts between Medaka and Zebrafish	Blastomere transplantation, Zebrafish, Medaka, Chimeras Background The Chimera is a mythological creature containing parts of different animals – the body of one species, the head of another species, the tail of yet another species, and so on. In genetics, the term is used to define an organism where cells have diverse genetic information – usually a different genetic origin. In the field of developmental biology, chimeras and genetic mosaics have long been used as powerful tools to differentiate cell intrinsic from cell extrinsic processes, as well as to establish lineages (Le Douarin, 1993; Le Douarin and Dupin, 1993; Buckingham and Meilhac, 2011; Kretzschmar and Watt, 2012). The generation of chimeras and mosaics can be done genetically or mechanically, depending on the animal model of choice. For teleost fish, their external development allows the early, mechanical mixing of blastomeres among siblings and/or between a wild type and a mutant embryo. The use of a tracer in donor cells is typically used to identify the foreign cells in the developing host. There are well-established protocols for blastomere transplantation in different species of teleost fish – examples of blastula transplantation in the context of a specific biological question and explanatory videos on the process can be found (Haas and Gilmour, 2006; Rembold et al., 2006; Kemp et al., 2009; Centanin et al., 2011). Each of them takes into account the species-specific morphology of the early embryos and their developmental dynamics. Here, we modify existing protocols and establish a pipeline to generate zebrafish/medaka chimeras (Fuhrmann et al., 2020).

Intrinsic factors governing vector competence are often studied in a laboratory setting, where mosquitoes can be orally infected with arboviruses via an artificial bloodmeal. Artificial membrane feeding involves supplementing defibrinated animal blood with a virus of interest, introducing the blood into a feeding system that is heated to 37^°C by a water bath, and allowing the mosquitoes to feed on the blood through a membrane such as parafilm or hog’s gut. This strategy mimics the natural route of infection for a mosquito, albeit without a skin barrier that undoubtedly contains many factors that mediate the infection process. Feeding mosquitoes on infected animals overcomes this disadvantage, but animal models for many arboviruses remain limited (Reynolds et al., 2017) or cannot induce sufficient viremia for infecting mosquitoes.

Coordinated multicellular migration across a moist surface, known as bacterial swarming, is an important motility phenotype that has been studied for decades due to its relevance to pathogenicity, virulence, and antibiotic resistance (Kearns, 2010). A systematic study of colony expansion speed and morphological patterns coupled to swarming may provide insight into the correlation between bacterial motility and host health. Here, we build an environment-controlled incubator to perform a swarming assay. Inside the incubator, a digital camera is mounted on the top to take time-lapse images of the swarming activity. After the recording, images are transferred to a laptop for quantitation of the swarm expansion using the ImageJ software. The system was tested by recording over 1,000 swarming events to assure stability and reproducibility.

Among the various possible SSRs, trinucleotide repeats (TRs) represent one of the most common types in the exome of all eukaryotic genomes (Toth et al., 2000). Many TRs exhibit “dynamic mutations” that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, which states that mutations in a single gene may be stably transmitted between generations (Caburet et al., 2005). This can lead to genetic diseases where, in successive generations, the age of disease onset decreases and disease severity increases (Mirkin, 2006). These mutations – whose probability also increases with generations – are due to the intergenerational expansion of TRs. After a certain threshold in the repeat number of TRs is reached, the probability of further TR expansion and the severity of the disease increase with the number of repeats. The dynamic mutations associated with TRs cause severe neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders known generically as Trinucleotide (or Triplet) Repeat Expansion Diseases (TREDs), which lead to cell toxicity and death (Wells et al., 1998; Orr et al., 2007; Wells et al., 2005). To date, about 50 DNA expandable SSR diseases have been identified, and their number is expected to grow. The TR expansions are believed to be caused by DNA slippage during replication, repair, transcription, or recombination.
Bio-protocol-977	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4154	Quantitative Analysis of RNA Editing at Specific Sites in Plant Mitochondria or Chloroplasts	C to U RNA editing, DNA sequencing, Mitochondria, Chloroplasts, Editing extent Background C to U RNA editing is one of the most important post-transcriptional modifications that occur in the plant mitochondrial or chloroplast genes, which usually changes the first or second positions of nucleic acid triplet codons leading to altered protein sequences and is essential for their normal functions (Takenaka et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2018). The RNA editing and processing in mitochondria or chloroplasts have been reported to function in plant male sterility, seed development, adaptations to the environment, and resistance to pathogens (Hammani et al., 2011; Dahan and Mireau, 2013; GarciaAndrade et al., 2013; Barkan and Small, 2014; Ren et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Several methods have been established for the detection of RNA editing sites or editing levels, such as poisoned primer extension (PPE) assays, high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, and DNA sequencing (Roberson et al., 2006; Chateigner-Boutin et al., 2007; Hayes and Hanson, 2007). However, the PPE assays usually require radiolabeled oligonucleotides (Hayes and Hanson, 2007). It is hard to distinguish the editing levels at two very close editing sites using HRM assays (Chateigner-Boutin et al., 2007). Currently, DNA sequencing has been an accurate, economic, and widely used method for the RNA editing assays (Bentolila et al., 2012; Brehme et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; He et al., 2018). Here, we describe a method for the RNA editing detection by DNA sequencing of cDNA to further evaluate the effects of different treatments or plant mutants on the C to U RNA editing in mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts (Yang et al., 2020).

Bio-protocol-980	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4151	Microscopic Detection of ASC Inflammasomes in Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages Post	ASC, Inflammasome, Fluorescence staining, Confocal microscopy, NLRP3, AIM2, NLRC4 Background The innate immune system has a key role in initiating and orchestrating host defense by detecting invading pathogens through membrane-bound and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs). Inflammasome activation is an essential innate immune event in response to pathogenic infection and sterile stimuli that causes the initiation of pyroptotic cell death and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 and IL-18. Inflammasome assembly is triggered by the activation of upstream sensors, such as NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, NLRC4, and PYRIN. Upon activation, sensor proteins form a complex in an ASC-dependent and -independent manner to mediate caspase-1 cleavage and activation. Cleaved caspase-1 in turn leads to the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 and IL-18 and the process of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016). The adaptor ASC protein is composed of a PYRIN domain (PYD) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which help ASC function as an adaptor to interact with upstream sensor and effector caspase-1 (Agrawal and Jha, 2020). ASC speck formation is a hallmark of inflammasome activation. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry are two major methods to detect ASC speck formation (Stutz et al., 2013; Sester et al., 2015; Beilharz et al., 2016; Hoss et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-981	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4150	In situ Hybridization of miRNAs in Human Embryonic Kidney and Human Pluripotent Stem Cellderived Kidney Organoids	Kidney development, Organoids, hESC, hPSC, MicroRNA, In situ hybridization, LNA probe Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (20-25 nucleotides) RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding predominantly to the 3^ UTRs of their target genes’ mRNAs and inhibiting their translation and/or causing their degradation (Bartel, 2018). An increasing number of studies now show that miRNAs play a crucial role in fine-tuning molecular pathways in the kidney, both in normal development and in disease (Jones et al., 2018; Trionfini et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019). The majority of these studies have been conducted on animal models, which do not always faithfully recapitulate the developmental events or disease phenotypes in humans. To overcome these limitations, we recently reported using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived kidney organoids (Bantounas et al., 2018; Takasato et al., 2015) as a model to study the role of the miR- 199a/214 cluster during human kidney development (Bantounas et al., 2021). In that study, we used in situ hybridization of miRNAs with digoxigenin-labelled lockednucleic acid (L N A^scriptscriptstyle(perp)) probes to detect the precise localization of the miRNAs of this cluster in paraffin sections of both native kidney and organoids. L N A^ probes have a chemically modified backbone to afford a higher melting temperature (T_m) per nucleotide than conventional DNA or RNA probes (Singh et al., 1998). They are, thus, ideally suited to the detection of smaller RNAs for which conventional probes would have too low a  T_m to bind efficiently. After binding to the tissue, the probes are detected by application of an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-linked, anti-digoxigenin antibody, followed by the addition of an AP substrate, which is converted to a coloured product, visible under a light microscope. Using this method, we discovered that miR-199a-3p and miR-214-3p were both present in the kidney stroma and in developing glomeruli but were largely absent from mature glomeruli. One of the miRNAs, miR274-3p , also exhibited strong tubular expression. In addition, we observed differences in the extent and distribution of expression between embryonic/fetal kidney and organoids (particularly in the case of miR199a-3p) ), possibly indicating that the two represented different developmental stages (Bantounas et al., 2021). This example demonstrates the main advantage of this method, which is the acquisition of spatial information regarding the expression of the miRNAs of interest within a given tissue. This information would be lost if one were to rely exclusively on transcriptional detection methods e.g., qPCR or Next Generation miRNA Sequencing (miRseq). The hybridization steps of the protocol presented here (see below) were adapted from Jørgensen et al. (2010) and were optimized for kidney/kidney organoids and the particular miRNAs we studied (Bantounas et al., 2021). However, the method can in principle be used with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of any tissue and for any miRNA or other small RNA of similar size.

Cytoduction takes advantage of a karyogamy mutant, kar1-1, in which nuclear fusion during mating is limited (Conde and Fink, 1976; Dutcher, 1981; Livingston, 1977). In a mating between KAR1 and kar1-1 cells, the cytoplasm is mixed but two distinct nuclei are maintained (Figure 1). The resulting daughter cells from this heterokaryon contain a mix of cytoplasm from both parents, yet only one of the original parental nuclei. This technique has been used as a tool to study and track other cytoplasmic elements such as mitochondria (Lancashire and Mattoon, 1979), killer toxins (Seki et al., 1985), and oligomycin resistance (Matsuoka et al., 1982). Cytoduction can also be used to replenish r h o^0 , or mitochondrial DNA deficient, strains with fresh mitochondria, thus restoring respiration deficiencies associated with the loss of mitochondrial DNA (Merz and Westermann, 2009; Stenger et al., 2020). Because many terms associated with cytoduction may not be universally familiar, definitions are available for reference in Table 1.

Walper2, *	Membrane vesicles, Lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum Background The membranes of all cells are dynamic structures, the biomolecule composition of which is constantly changing as cells respond to environmental stimuli, alter protein and lipid composition, release waste products, take in nutrients, and perform many other cellular processes (Vereb et al., 2003; Watson, 2015). Throughout cellular life cycles, fragments of the outermost membrane are often shed as nanosized particles. In bacteria, these structures are often referred to as membrane vesicles (MVs) or outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which will be referred to as MVs throughout for simplicity (a representative example of MVs from Lactobacillus casei is shown in Figure 1). As interest in these biological nanoparticles has grown in recent years, researchers have shown that MVs have broad biological activities, including host-microbe interactions, gene transfer, and community regulation (Kulp and Kuehn, 2010; Caruana and Walper, 2020).

Bio-protocol-989	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4142	U2.3 Precursor Small Nuclear RNA in vitro Processing Assay	snRNA, Pre-snRNA, Processing, Arabidopsis, In vitro Background As critical components of spliceosome for the processing and splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are essential and fundamental non-coding small RNAs in eukaryotic cells. The transcription complex relying on the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is required for most snRNA transcription (including U1, U2, U4, and U5), except for U6, which depends on RNA polymerase III (Pol III) (Carbon et al., 1987; Vankan and Filipowicz, 1988). The Pol II mediated transcription of snRNA requires a set of integrator factors (INTs) in metazoans (Baillat et al., 2005). INTs contain at least 14 subunits in metazoans (Baillat et al., 2005; Chen and Wagner, 2010), associated with C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II to form the transcription complex. Recently, five plant INT factors involved in snRNA biosynthesis were identified in Arabidopsis and termed Defective in snRNA Processing (DSP), including DSP1-4 and CPSF73-I (Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 73k D a_ ) (Liu et al., 2016). The INTs/DSPs are recruited to the promoter of snRNA and associate with Pol II to synthesize the pre-snRNA, transcribing it beyond the 3^ end of mature snRNAs. The nascent pre-snRNA transcripts contain the snRNA sequence and the excessive 3^ box RNA fragment. Consequently, pre-snRNAs are subject to z^ maturation, a process involving endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent transcript at the cleavage site located on the upstream of the 3^ box, to produce mature snRNA (Uguen and Murphy, 2003 and 2004; Baillat et al., 2005; Chen and Wagner, 2010).

Our ability to investigate the biological roles of nascent RNA structure and function therefore depends on the development of tools that can assess RNA cotranscriptionally. One successful approach towards this goal has been to leverage the extraordinary stability of the ternary RNAP-DNA template-nascent RNA complex to measure and manipulate nascent RNA in the context of arrested transcription elongation complexes (TECs) (Buenrostro et al., 2014; Tome et al., 2014; Watters et al., 2016; Strobel et al., 2017; Widom et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-991	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4140	Measurement of LRRK2 Kinase Activity by Proximity Ligation Assay	Proximity ligation assay, Parkinson’s disease, LRRK2, Fluorescence Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (Dorsey and Bloem, 2018), which is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Approximately 10% of cases are caused by single gene mutations, while 90% are due to generally unknown causes and are termed idiopathic PD (iPD). Missense mutations in leucine rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant PD (Paisan-Ruiz et al., 2004; Zimprich et al., 2004). These mutations result in a toxic gain of function related to elevated LRRK2 kinase activity (West et al., 2005; Greggio et al., 2006). The LRRK2 gene locus is also a risk factor for iPD (Simon-Sanchez et al., 2009), and increased kinase activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of iPD (Fraser et al., 2016; Di Maio et al., 2018).

Macho1, *	Ralstonia solanacearum, Stem injection, Tomato, Virulence, Fitness, Bacterial wilt Background Ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of bacterial wilt disease in more than 250 plant species including important crops, such as tomato, potato, pepper, and eggplant, among others, and is considered one of the most dangerous plant pathogens in the world (Mansfield et al., 2012). R. solanacearum is a soil-borne pathogen that enters plants through the roots, using wounds, root tips, and secondary root emergence points as penetration sites; it then progresses via the root cortex, finally reaching the vascular system (Xue et al., 2020). In susceptible plants, R. solanacearum moves through the xylem vessels to colonize the whole plant; eventual replication may lead to populations up to 10^10 bacteria per gram of plant tissue in diseased plants, which will block water and nutrient flow in the vascular system and eventually cause plant wilting and death (Peeters et al., 2013). Multiple experimental methods to assess R. solanacearum virulence in plants under laboratory conditions have been described previously (Morel et al., 2018). The most widely used assay relies on soil-drenching of plant roots with R. solanacearum suspensions, followed by observation of the resulting wilting symptoms over time (Morel et al., 2018). Other assays involve bypassing the root penetration process by introducing the bacterial suspensions directly into plant tissues (either leaves or stems) and provide more accurate assessments of bacterial replication (Macho et al., 2010; Morel et al., 2018; Yu and

Bio-protocol-999	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4132	Preparation of Zygotes and Embryos of the Kelp Saccharina latissima for Cell Biology Approaches	Brown alga, Gametogenesis, Embryogenesis, Kelp, Saccharina, Cultivation, Zygote Background Brown algae are a group of mainly marine photosynthetic organisms with exclusively multicellular body plans (thallus). Their thallus ranges from small filaments like in Ectocarpus species to the large conspicuous parenchymatic kelps (Charrier et al., 2012). Kelps in particular play a major ecological role as habitat for other organisms and are important primary producers in coastal ecosystems. Kelps also attract considerable economic interest, mainly as food sources (e.g., kombu). In addition, extracts from brown algae have shown anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects (Cumashi et al., 2007; Han et al., 2019; Long et al., 2019; Mohibbullah et al., 2019), and their biomass is used as bioethanol (Adams et al., 2009; Kraan, 2016). This altogether raises special interest in their metabolism and physiology. This is particularly the case for Saccharina latissima, as shown by an 5 -fold increase in publications over the past 10 years (from 40 in 2010 to more than 180 in 2020; Web of Knowledge), elevating it to currently being the most studied brown alga worldwide. However, this interest focuses mainly on its ecophysiology and less on its development, a balance that this protocol, in combination with expected publications, aims to improve.
Bio-protocol-1000	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4131	A Novel Method to Make Polyacrylamide Gels with Mechanical Properties Resembling those of Biological Tissues	Viscoelasticity, Polyacrylamide, Viscosity sensing, Mechanosensing, Extracellular matrix Background Biological tissues are viscoelastic materials that combine features of elastic solids and viscous fluids. Different tissues contain different amounts of the components that contribute to both viscosity (e.g., hyaluronic acid) and elasticity (e.g., collagen fibers), and their structure and proportion change during pathological processes. The widespread use of elastomers or hydrogels as substrates for cell culture (Pelham and Wang, 1997) has revealed the strong impact of substrate mechanics on cell structure and function and focused attention on the limited view of cell biology derived from studies of cells on traditional glass or plastic substrates (Janmey et al., 2020). Until recently, studies of cellular response to substrate or matrix stiffness only examined how cells respond to elastic modulus alterations, with the viscous contribution being either neglected or uncontrolled. Theories of cell mechanosensing have also generally focused on the elastic resistance of the substrate. These limitations were largely due to the lack of suitable materials in which viscosity can be systematically varied within a viscoelastic substrate. There now exist three general approaches for introducing viscous dissipation in a viscoelastic substrate. In one, a polymerizing and crosslinking system, like a polyacrylamide gel, is designed to produce a network near the threshold of the sol-gel transition, such that there are significant elastic properties but also significant viscosity (Cameron et al., 2011). A second method forms crosslinked polymer networks with two classes of crosslinkers: one is covalent and static and the other is noncovalent and dynamic. These first two classes of material are viscoelastic fluids, or viscoplastic material, meaning that if subjected to constant stress, they can deform without limits, as the crosslinks or entanglements rearrange to minimize energy in the deformed state (Chaudhuri et al., 2016). The third class of material, which is the topic of this report, is viscoelastic solids. These materials dissipate substantial energy when they are deformed and slowly continue to deform in response to constant stress;

These errors lead to changes or modifications in the structure and chemical nature of genomic DNA. The replication machinery is tightly associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways, thereby recovering cells from such damage (Chatterjee and Walker, 2017). Alternatively, the DNA damage response pathways can induce apoptosis (Nowsheen and Yang, 2012); however, some DNA damage is undetected and unrepaired, accumulating over a period of time. Accumulation of this DNA damage during aging poses a serious challenge to the healthy functioning of a variety of tissues, including hematopoietic systems. Recent studies have indicated that accumulation of age-related physiological changes in the stem cell population leads to alterations in immune system function (Oh et al., 2014). In addition, several age-associated malignancies have been linked to DNA damage accumulation in the stem cell compartment (Beerman, 2017). Hematopoietic stem cells have cytoprotective and genoprotective mechanisms to safeguard their long-lasting functional potential; however, it has been demonstrated that DNA damage accumulates in HSCs during the aging process. Several research groups have proposed that this accumulation is due to increased proliferation rates in old HSCs. In contrast, others show that long-term dormancy may prevent rare DNA damage from accumulating due to lack of replication-associated repair (Beerman et al., 2014).

Bio-protocol-1004	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4127	Preparation of Drosophila Larval Blood Cells for Single-cell RNA Sequencing	Drosophila, Hemocytes, Blood cells, scRNA-seq, Hemolymph, Sessile, Circulation Background Drosophila myeloid-like blood cells, also called hemocytes, are composed of three major types: plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes, which are analogous to macrophages, platelets, and giant cells, respectively, in higher vertebrates (Banerjee et al., 2019). These hemocytes are highly dynamic in nature and respond to various inflammatory conditions, thus making Drosophila a simple and ideal genetic model to study hematopoiesis, infections, wounding, and other blood disorders (Vlisidou and Wood, 2015; Banerjee et al., 2019). Hemocytes are mainly derived from embryonic and larval hematopoiesis, and are primarily located as sub-epidermal ‘hubs’ (otherwise known as sessile/resident hemocyte populations), with a fraction of hemocytes circulating in the larval hemolymph (Markus et al., 2009; Gold and Bruckner, 2015). The sessile hemocytes can be mechanically dislodged and forced into circulation for a brief period by applying a force to the larvae, such as by vortexing (Petraki et al., 2015). This “hemocyte disturbance assay” allows for the retrieval of blood cells in higher numbers, which typically cannot be obtained by larval bleeding without prior perturbation, and thus is useful for experimental analyses requiring significant cell material. In cases where circulating and sessile hemocyte populations need to be assayed separately, a “hemocyte bleed/scrape assay” could be employed, in which circulating cells can be bled and obtained prior to obtaining sessile populations by the ‘scraping’ method. For a detailed experimental approach to the larval bleeding method in general, we highly recommend the visual protocol by Brückner and colleagues (Petraki et al., 2015). We have adapted the “hemocyte disturbance assay” as one of the critical steps in our approach (Tattikota et al., 2020) to isolate and prepare circulating hemocytes together with sessile hemocytes for their subsequent use in microfluidics-based scRNA-seq platforms, including inDrops (Klein et al., 2015; Zilionis et al., 2017), Drop-seq (Macosko et al., 2015), and 10X Genomics (Zheng et al., 2017). By combining mechanical disruption, simple bleeding, and gradient or traditional centrifugation, we obtain single hemocytes in suspension with a higher yield of cells without compromising cell quality. Since this protocol does not involve enzymatic dissociation, isolated hemocytes are of high quality with regards to viability and are therefore advantageous for downstream scRNA-seq methodologies.

The spatial organization of a biofilm aggregate is highly heterogeneous and has diverse metabolic activities, rendering the biofilm robust and tolerant to numerous types of environmental stress (Van Dyck et al., 2021). Hence,biofilms are promising in industry to ferment for nutrient conversion, degrade hazardous compounds for bioremediation, and generate electricity in microbial fuel cells (Coenye and Nelis, 2010). Conversely, biofilms also raise public concerns such as biofouling and biofilm-associated infections. Biofilms are the leading cause of chronic wound infections and infections on biomedical devices, such as cardiac valves, tracheal tubes, and catheters (Del Pozo et al., 2018). An improved understanding and characterization of biofilm formation, dispersion, and activities will shed light on biofilm control strategies.

During this in vitro selection, initial library construction is an important step in obtaining highaffinity binders. For example, to develop a nanobody, the VHH domains of camel antibodies obtained after immunization were used for the construction of an initial library (Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 1997). Alternatively, the VHH domains from naïve genes or a semi-synthetic or synthetic library could be used as the initial library (Goldman et al., 2006; Monegal et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-1007	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4124	Oil Red O Staining for Lipid Content in Caenorhabditis elegans	Oil Red O, Fat, Lipid metabolism, C. elegans Background Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying the interplay between lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Caenorhabditis elegans has proved to be a powerful genetic system for elucidating complex physiological mechanisms and identifying novel genetic pathways. Lipid metabolism is a highly conserved process across eukaryotes. Many of the mammalian genes of the lipid metabolic pathways function similarly in C. elegans (Ashrafi, 2007; Jones and Ashrafi, 2009). Furthermore, several lipid regulatory pathways identified in C. elegans have been confirmed in mammalian systems (McKay et al., 2003; Suh et al., 2007). These features have made C. elegans an excellent animal model to study the regulation of fat accumulation and distribution.
Bio-protocol-1008	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4123	Clearing of the Mouse Brain for Optical Imaging Using CUBIC	Tissues Clearing, CUBIC, 3D imaging, Rotating-disc confocal imaging Background Tissue optical clearing (TOC) enables the visualization of regions of interest in deep tissue and is now widely established. In recent years, a variety of methods have been developed based on organic solvents, water-based non-gels, and hydrogels (Ertürk et al., 2011; Chung and Deisseroth, 2013; Ke et al., 2013); however, both the CLARITY and 3DISCO protocols are associated with significant drawbacks: 3DISCO loses endogenous protein fluorescence and involves toxic and flammable substances (Matsumoto et al., 2019), while CLARITY relies on dedicated equipment for electrophoresis. In addition, acrylamide has carcinogenicity and toxicity in its aqueous form (Hogervorst et al., 2007). Compared with these other brain-clearing techniques, CUBIC is safe, simple to operate, and efficiently achieves transparency. This method clears fixed brain samples in a few days to render the brain transparent, thus meeting the quality requirements of optical imaging of the sample. Using the standard CUBIC tissue clearing procedure, we subject mouse brain samples to transcardial perfusion, clearing, immersion in antibody solution, and refractive index matching. The aminoalcohol used can effectively remove hemochrome from hemoglobin and myoglobin, which not only reduces light scattering but also lessens the absorption of light to achieve further decolorization and transparency. When combined with rotating-disc confocal microscopy, CUBIC facilitates comprehensive and quantitative analyses for understanding the brain structure on the millimeter-scale level. It boasts a simple clearance procedure (Muntifering et al., 2018), excellent clearance effect in a short time frame (approximately 11 days) (Wan et al., 2018), and outstanding fluorescence preservation (Tainaka et al., 2018), making it a popular option among research labs.

Bio-protocol-1010	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4121	Monitoring Protein Splicing Using In-gel Fluorescence Immediately Following SDS-PAGE	In-gel fluorescence, Green fluorescent protein, Intein, Protein splicing Background Phylogenetically widespread in the microbial world, inteins (intervening proteins) have generated substantial interest as agents of autocatalysis, drivers of evolution, antibacterial and antifungal targets, and for biotechnological application (Lennon and Belfort, 2017). In the protein splicing reaction, the intein is removed by rearranging two peptide bonds and connecting the surrounding sequences, known as N-and C-exteins, with a peptide bond. While this process can occur in the absence of any external factors, its rate can be highly variable depending on conditions. Recently, compelling evidence has demonstrated that inteins can act as environmental sensors that regulate protein function in response to conditions such as metals, heat, salt, oxidative stress, and DNA damage (Belfort, 2017). Thus, significant interest from both basic and applied communities necessitate the investigation of inteins.

Bio-protocol-1013	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4118	Acid Hydrolysis for the Extraction of Archaeal Core Lipids and HPLC-MS Analysis	Archaea, Cell membrane, Core lipids, Acid hydrolysis, HPLC-MS, Extremophiles Background Although found in all biotopes on Earth, Archaea are known as the main inhabitants of the most extreme environments, be it due to temperature, pH, salinity, hydrostatic pressure, or other environmental stressors (Komatsu and Chong, 1998; Baba et al., 1999). This ability to cope with multiple extreme conditions has been associated with one of their most diagnostic features, i.e., the unique structure of their membrane lipids. Indeed, instead of the typical lipids commonly found in Bacteria and Eukarya, which are built upon straight fatty-acyl chains ester-linked to a glycerol backbone in a sn-1,2 configuration, archaeal lipids contain polyisoprenoid alkyl chains that are ether-linked to a glycerol in a sn-2,3 configuration (De Rosa and Gambacorta, 1988). While polyisoprenoid alkyl chains provide greater membrane packing and impermeability compared to fatty acyl chains due to their heavy branching (Komatsu and Chong, 1998), ether bonds are more chemically and thermally resistant than ester linkages and less polar (Baba et al., 1999), both contributing to the enhanced stability of archaeal membranes. In addition, most Archaea are also capable of synthesizing both bilayer-forming diether lipids (one polar moiety) and membrane-spanning tetraether lipids (two polar moieties), the latter generating membrane monolayers that are even more rigid and impermeable than archaeal bilayers (Chong, 2010). In contrast to their core lipids, the polar head groups of archaeal lipids remain very similar to those of Bacteria and Eukarya, with phospho- and glyco-lipids deriving from sugars (glycerol, inositol, glucose, and N-acetylhexosamine) (Jensen et al., 2015), aminoacids (serine and ethanolamine) (Koga et al., 1993), or combinations of both (Koga et al., 1993). Although substantial lipidomes, e.g., containing up to 100 structures, have been described for Archaea (e.g., Elling et al., 2017; Bale et al., 2019), those remain less diverse than the lipidomes of Bacteria and Eukarya, which comprise hundreds to thousands of different lipid structures (Gerl et al., 2012). In addition to this large difference between archaeal and other typical lipidomes, several studies have reported biases in archaeal lipid extraction and detection (Huguet et al., 2010; Cario et al., 2015), suggesting that a significant part of the archaeal lipidome might remain inaccessible to current methodologies. The absence of procedures to completely extract and analyze archaeal lipids currently hinders our understanding of their membrane physiology and adaptation. However, partial comprehension of these phenomena can easily and reproducibly be obtained by the removal of the lipids’ polar head groups, granting access to exhaustive, and thus precise, archaeal core lipid compositions (De Rosa et al., 1980; Trincone et al., 1992; Hopmans et al., 2000; Cario et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-1019	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4112	Purification of Recombinant Wild Type and	RyR, HEK293, Affinity purification, Sucrose gradient purification, Membrane protein Background RyRs are intracellular Ca^2+ channels located on sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticula and are present in nearly all cell types, including excitable cells such as neurons and muscles. In skeletal and  cardiac  muscles,  excitation-contraction  coupling  takes  place  by  activation  of  RyRs  via dihydropyridine receptors on the T-tubular membrane (Samsó, 2017). Since RyRs are membraneembedded proteins, their purification requires solubilization in detergent (e.g., CHAPS, Digitonin, Tween-20) within aqueous buffers; however, excessive or insufficient detergent can denature or leave the channels only partially solubilized, respectively. The FK506-binding proteins of 12 and 12.6 k D a (FKBP12 and FKBP12.6) are important RyR modulators, which bind to RyR with high affinity. Hence, detergent-solubilized RyR can be purified using GST-FKBP (or SBP-FKBP) affinity chromatography. However, FKBP exhibits reduced binding to RyR in vitro (Zissimopoulos et al., 2012), resulting in a lower than expected yield of pure RyR. Considering that RyR is the largest known ion channel, with a molecular weight of 2.3M D a (a tetramer of 565k D a monomers), sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration are suitable for its purification, in which RyR elutes as a peak from the denser fraction (sucrose gradient) or as the first peak (gel filtration). In recent years, structures have been solved at near-atomic resolution for both RyR1 and RyR2, which were purified from skeletal or cardiac muscle (Gong et al., 2020). More than 300 identified RyR mutations cause a number of debilitating or fatal disorders, most of which result in a gain-of-function phenotype; therefore, their structure is of significant interest. However, transgenic animals carrying RyR mutations have a lower or zero survival rate, and obtaining homozygous animals for severe RyR mutations is exceptionally difficult or impossible; thus, purification of RyR from cells is an attractive solution. Among the different cell types, bacteria lack the endoplasmic reticulum compartment where RyR resides and are therefore unsuitable for RyR expression. Among eukaryotic systems, the most widely used are mammalian cells such as HEK293 cells, which can easily accommodate the 15,000-bp cDNA and possess the mammalian machinery for post-translational modifications. Ideally, the cells are stably transfected with a plasmid containing an inducible promoter, such as pcDNA5/FRT/TO, which was designed for use with the Flp-In-T-Rex system in our case. The main limitation of cell culture is the low mass yield as compared with that of muscle tissue. Other limitations include the requirement for high quantities of expensive supplies such as cell culture media and the time required for cell culture (2-3 weeks) as well as for the sucrose gradient centrifugation-based protocol 3 days). We were the first to purify recombinant RyR at a high yield from HEK293 cells using sucrose gradient centrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography (Iyer et al., 2020). In the same work, we also used a one-step affinity chromatography that, although resulting in a lower yield, was faster and allowed complete purification in one day. Hence, purifying recombinant RyR from HEK293 cells using either of these two protocols is suitable for structural and functional studies that require high quantities of pure mutant RyR. Additionally, this protocol may serve as the starting point for purification of other membrane proteins of similar size, although the detergent solubilization conditions will need to be customized for the membrane protein of interest.
Bio-protocol-1020	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4111	Purification and Cryo-electron Microscopy Analysis of Plant Mitochondrial Ribosomes Florent Waltz1, #, *, Philippe Giegé2, #, * and Yaser Hashem 1, #, *	Plant mitochondria, Mitoribosome, Sucrose density gradient, Cryo-EM, Electron microscopy image processing Background Mitochondria are essential organelles that act as both energy conversion powerhouses and metabolic hubs in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria contain a genome and fully functional gene expression machinery. These gene expression complexes combine traits inherited from prokaryotic ancestors and specific features acquired during eukaryotic evolution (Gray, 2015; Waltz and Giegé, 2020). Mitochondrial research has huge societal implications given that numerous diseases are linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions in humans and many other eukaryotes (Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012; De Silva et al., 2015). For instance, in plants, male sterility resulting from recombined mitochondrial DNA is a trait widely used in agronomy (Chen and Liu, 2014). Among mitochondrial gene expression processes, translation is considered the most important in terms of regulation since it is clear that transcriptional processes are not limiting for mitochondrial gene expression. Still, the mechanistic details of translational regulation, and even the basic composition of the translational machinery, remain poorly understood for many eukaryotes. Recent functional, biochemical, and structural data have revealed an unexpected diversity of mitochondrial translation systems, in particular of their key players, the mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) in diverse eukaryotes (Waltz and Giegé, 2020). In particular, the mitoribosomes of the land plant Arabidopsis thaliana and cauliflower were recently characterized at the biochemical and structural levels, revealing their unique and unexpected features such as the occurrence of novel domains and additional plant-specific ribosomal proteins (Waltz et al., 2019, 2020a and 2020b). This represents the first examples of mitoribosome characterization in photosynthetic organisms. These major advances have only been possible as a result of the recent advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques, acknowledged by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to J. Frank, J. Dubochet, and R. Henderson in 2017 (Cressey and Callaway, 2017). Cryo-EM is an electron microscopy technique that is used to investigate the structure of various types of biomolecules from single proteins to large complexes such as ribosomes. The technique relies on imaging isolated macromolecules and complexes that are embedded in vitreous water on a microscopy grid. To do so, the liquid sample containing the biomolecules is flash-frozen to cryogenic temperatures in liquid ethane. Thanks to this process, the complexes can conserve their native organization and structure. Near atomic resolution structures, and even atomic structures (Nakane et al., 2020), of biological complexes, can be obtained through computational processing and averaging of multiple images, which ultimately allow 3D reconstruction of the complexes.
Bio-protocol-1021	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4110	Purification of Mitochondrial Ribosomes with the Translocase Oxa1L from HEK Cells	Mitochondria, Ribosome purification, Mitoribosome, Oxa1L, Biochemistry, Cryo-EM Background Human mitochondria possess their own genome and house all the components necessary for transcription, RNA maturation, and translation of the encoded genetic information (Dennerlein et al., 2017). The mitoribosome, one of the most important machineries within mitochondria, is responsible for the translation of essential mitochondrial mRNAs encoding components of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (Ott et al., 2016). Since all proteins translated by the human mitoribosome are membrane proteins, knowledge of the mechanism of co-translational membrane protein insertion is central to understanding mitoribosome translation (Hildenbeutel et al., 2012; Stiller et al., 2016). In human mitochondria, the oxidase assembly 1-like (Oxa1L) translocase plays a central role in the membrane insertion of mitochondrially encoded products (Haque et al., 2010; Stiller et al., 2016); however, due to the unique features of mitochondria, little is known regarding the molecular and quality control mechanisms underlying mitochondrial translation.

In a limited number of species – Mus musculus (mice), Danio rerio (zebrafish), C. elegans (worms), and Drosophila melanogaster (flies) – this can be accomplished by germline transgenesis. For example, transgenic animals can be generated in which regulatory elements from a gene selectively expressed by a cell type of interest drive the expression of a reporter.

The autonomic nervous system consists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated by decreased blood glucose and is essential in initiating  the  counter-regulatory  responses  to  hypoglycemia  (Ahren  and  Holst,  2001).  The parasympathetic nervous system mediates the cephalic phase insulin secretion and is activated in response to feeding (Louis-Sylvestre, 1978; Strubbe and Steffens, 1993; Teff and Townsend, 1999). The roles of sensory innervation in pancreatic function remain poorly understood, but sensory islet innervation is implicated in hormone release and glucose homeostasis (Ahren, 2000). Parasympathetic intrapancreatic ganglia, consisting of aggregates of neuronal cell bodies, are scattered throughout the pancreas and act as neuronal networks that integrate intrinsic and external nerve inputs to modulate pancreatic functions (Li et al., 2019). Metabolic pathologies, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), remodel the pancreatic environment in mice and humans, including islet morphology and endocrine and exocrine innervation (Giannulis et al., 2014; Mundinger et al., 2016; Lundberg et al.,

A single dsDNA break in the genome results in increased frequencies of recombination and promotes integration of homologous recombination (HR)-based vectors (Hasty et al., 1991; Hoshijima et al., 2016; Orr-Weaver et al., 1981; Rong and Golic, 2000; Shin et al., 2014; Zu et al., 2013). Additionally, in vitro or in vivo linearization of targeting vectors stimulates homology-directed repair (HDR) (Hasty et al., 1991; Hoshijima et al., 2016; Jasin and Berg, 1988; Orr-Weaver et al., 1981; Rong and Golic, 2000; Shin et al., 2014; Zu et al., 2013). Utilizing HDR or HR at a targeted double-strand break (DSB) allows directional knock-in of exogenous DNA with base-pair precision; however, reported frequencies vary widely, and engineering targeting vectors with long homology arms is not straightforward.

While NGS has enabled better therapeutic approaches, the identification of a particular mutation causing a disease and the course of action for treatment remedies needs substantial validation (Arreaza et al., 2016). An ideal and sensitive approach is to validate the candidate genes as biomarkers using RT-qPCR, for which a good quality starting material in the form of biomolecules (DNA/RNA) is required. However, the extraction procedure using samples from various collection and preservation methods has been a great challenge, especially formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks (Heydt et al., 2014). FFPE tissue blocks are one of the most common methods of tissue preservation since they allow preservation of cellular components and architecture (Donczo and Guttman, 2018; Groelz et al., 2018), can provide specimen quickly, and are essential in the histopathology lab for diagnosis. The disadvantage of this method is that longer exposure to formalin may cause crosslinking of proteins and nucleic acids, which can result in potential DNA/RNA damage (Williams et al., 1999; Do and Dobrovic, 2015, Atanesyan, 2017). Previously, FFPE samples were not considered a good source for molecular analysis, since nucleic acids are extensively modified in this process (Blow et al., 2007; Bass et al., 2014). Steps such as preparation, fixation, embedding, and storage can affect DNA/RNA quality, which can further influence later stage diagnostics and research (Nam et al., 2014; Turashvili et al., 2012). In the recent past, efforts have been made to isolate smaller quantities/aliquots of DNA/RNA from FFPE samples using appropriate proteinase digestion and buffers (Sah et al., 2013, Sarnecka et al., 2019). The purified biomolecules could be used for further downstream processes such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), microarray, and next-generation sequencing analyses (Taga et al., 2013; Ludyga et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2020). Although commercial kits are available for FFPE extraction, there is a need for a better protocol describing extraction procedures for biomolecules (DNA/RNA) from FFPE tissue specimens. This protocol is mainly based on the deparaffinization of FFPE blocks and proteolytic digestion with proteinase K/protease. We have further optimized this protocol for DNA and RNA extraction using a QIAamp FFPE DNA extraction kit and the TRIzol method, respectively.

While displaying some canonical macrophage activities, such as the phagocytosis of debris and apoptotic bodies, microglia are also endowed with functions specific to the CNS microenvironment, such as synaptic remodeling, neuronal support, and oligodendrogenesis (Ransohoff and Khoury, 2016; Clayton et al., 2017; Li and Barres, 2018). This wide array of functions implies the existence of a diverse set of microglia phenotypes, states, and subsets well suited to characterization by single-cell analytical approaches. Fluorescence-based flow cytometry, a technique routinely used in immunological studies, allows for high-throughput, multiparametric analysis of single cells in suspension, isolated from blood or from dissociated tissues. However, the dissociation of CNS tissues generates a large amount of debris, principally myelin fragments, which must be removed before flow cytometry analysis. Commonly cited isolation techniques dissociate CNS tissue through enzymatic digestion and utilize magnetic bead-based strategies to remove myelin or isolate microglia. However, commonly used proteases in enzymatic tissue digestion, such as collagenase and trypsin, can lead to the unintended cleavage of surface antigens on microglia (Autengruber et al., 2012) and promote cellular transcriptional changes during the 37^°C incubations required for enzymatic activity (O’Flanagan et al., 2019, Mattei et al., 2020). In addition, magnetic bead isolation is costly, limits study throughput, and, in our hands, does not improve the yield or viability compared to this protocol, which in young ( 3 month) mice yields approximately 2.5×10^5 microglia for analysis by flow cytometry. In this study, we describe the preparation of CNS single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry by utilizing a simple mechanical tissue dissociation procedure followed by myelin removal via density centrifugation. Cost-efficient and easy to perform, all steps of this protocol are carried out on ice or at 4^°C , limiting cellular changes that would otherwise occur during isolation at higher temperatures.

However, because this method requires a great amount of skill and care to perform correctly, it remains one of the most difficult in neuroscience. A crucial step in this method is the formation of a tight, high resistance (e.g., >Omega ) connection between the cell membrane and the glass pipette known as a gigaseal. Gigaseal formation requires a clean pipette surface, and even small contaminants (e.g., cell debris or dust) can disrupt this process (Hamill et al., 1981). For this reason, patch-clamp experimenters need to replace glass pipettes after each recording attempt (Figure 1A), requiring additional time and attention (e.g., removal, fabrication, filling, and installation of pipettes). We have previously found that contrary to decades of this ubiquitous practice in the field, patch-clamp pipettes can be cleaned and reused, enabling many patch clamp recordings with a single pipette (Kolb et al., 2016).

The development of a wide range of biosensors for monitoring ions, molecules, and even phytohormones in plants has greatly increased over recent decades (Hilleary et al., 2018; Walia et al., 2018). In particular, the spatiotemporal coordination of ion dynamics is essential for diverse cellular processes and signaling pathways. Genetically encoded probes such as the Ca^2+ sensor CaMeleon have been extensively used to understand ion dynamics (Miyawaki et al., 1997; Nagai et al., 2004; Monshausen et al., 2008), which became an accessible tool through the generation of stable transgenic lines. The popularization of such approaches has allowed intracellular detection and monitoring, improving our understanding of the extensive role of  C a^2+ , especially in cell signaling, regulation, and communication (Feijó and Wudick, 2018; Walia et al., 2018). The specific expression of biosensors targeted to particular compartments or organelles, together with appropriate live-imaging and genetic tools, has led to the detection and visualization of Ca^2+ waves in roots (Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016), propagation of electrical signals in leaves (Nguyen et al., 2018), Ca^2+ -based long-distance signaling (Toyota et al., 2018) and intercellular communication (Ngo et al., 2014). Addressing such phenomena at an organismal level elucidates how these signals are propagated, also showing the physiological integration across tissues and organs.
Bio-protocol-1048	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4083	Ethanol-induced Sedative Behavior: An Assay to Investigate Increased Dopamine Signaling in	EtOH (Ethanol), C. elegans, Dopamine (DA), Sedative behavior Background Alcohol is a widely abused drug with a plethora of associated diseases that can impact societal functioning. Multiple studies have focused on unravelling the mode of action and effect of this drug; however, the neuronal mechanisms underlying alcohol susceptibility and disinhibition are unclear. Studies across various species have demonstrated that alcohol intake increases the release of the neurotransmitter DA that induces the reward pathway (Imperato and Di Chiara, 1986; Weiss et al., 1996; Baik, 2013). Although C. elegans does not mimic all the complexities of the mammalian system, it has been successfully modeled for studying alcohol-dependent neuronal behaviors. Studies show that C. elegans display diverse aspects of alcohol responses (Davies et al., 2003 and 2004). Previously, investigations in C. elegans have revealed that there is a dose-dependent decline in the locomotor activity upon acute and chronic alcohol exposure at a concentration of 400-500 mM (Davies et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2009). The DA system in C. elegans is involved in feeding, movement, learning, and memory; and similar to that of mammals, signals through two receptor subfamilies D1-like and D2-like receptors. Mutants of the D2-like receptor, dop-2, exhibited no obvious phenotype when analyzed for DAdependent behaviors, despite being expressed in all dopaminergic neurons and predicted to be an autoreceptor (Chase et al., 2004). We devised an assay utilizing the EIS behavior observed in mutants of dop-2 to investigate the neuronal circuitry involved in regulating locomotory behavior under the
Bio-protocol-1049	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4082	PCR-mediated One-day Synthesis of Guide RNA for the CRISPR/Cas9 System	CRISPR/Cas9, Genome editing, Guide RNA, PCR-based, Yeast Background Developing genome editing techniques is one of the central issues of genome science. For the past decade, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has contributed to easier and more precise genome editing as compared with previously developed techniques such as ZFN (zinc finger nuclease) and TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease). For successful CRISPR/Cas9 engineering, design, expression, and delivery of the guide RNA (gRNA) components are the key factors (Stovicek et al., 2017). For prokaryotes like Escherichia coli and eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most commonly employed method for expressing gRNA is to use a plasmid (Jiang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; DiCarlo et al., 2013; Bao et al., 2015; Jakočiunas et al., 2015a and 2015b); however, plasmid construction, including cloning steps for necessary components, is laborious, costly, and timeconsuming. To express gRNA more simply, in this study we developed a method that we call gRNAtransient expression system (gRNA-TES), where gRNA is expressed from the PCR product. gRNA-TES is very fast and effective: it takes only 5-6 h to complete the whole process, including preparation of PCR products for expression of gRNA in yeast cells and yeast transformation. By contrast, it takes at least 3-4 days to construct a plasmid expressing gRNA including verification. As expected, when applied to replacement of desired chromosome regions in yeast, gRNA-TES effectively replaces single and multiple chromosomal regions (Easmin et al., 2019 and 2020). Therefore, we believe that gRNA-TES will be useful for other types of genome editing including segmental deletion, duplication, and splitting of chromosomes. Lastly, gRNA-TES is effective in yeast; therefore, it should be emphasized that gRNATES may also be efficacious in other organisms if suitable gene promoters are incorporated.
Bio-protocol-1050	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4081	Yeast Lipid Extraction and Analysis by HPTLC	Lipid extraction, TLC, Lipid staining, Phospholipid, Neutral lipid, Budding yeast Background Lipid research has gained great momentum in recent years, stimulated in part by the interest in lipid-associated disorders in humans, in part by aspirations of biofuel and biopharmaceutical production. Lipids play vital roles in many biological processes, including the formation of biomembranes, the storage of energy, and numerous signal transduction processes. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been an excellent model organism for studying the physiological and pathophysiological roles of lipids at the cellular level (Popa et al., 2016). Primary lipid metabolism is highly conserved between yeast and humans in both the basic biochemical pathways and the regulatory circuitries that link lipid metabolism to energy homeostasis, cell growth, and development. One advantage of using yeast in lipid-related research is that the pathways and molecular compositions are often less complicated than those in mammals, facilitating their scientific investigation. In yeast, PA (phosphatidate  acid),  PC  (phosphatidylcholine),  PE  (phosphatidylethanolamine),  PI (phosphatidylinositol),  PS  (phosphatidylserine),  DAG  (diacylycerols),  and  their  respective  lysoderivatives are the most abundant membrane lipid classes, while PG (phosphatidylglycerol) and CL (cardiolipin) are less abundant. TAG (triacylglycerol) and SE (sterol ester) act as storage lipids. The most abundant yeast sphingolipids consist of IPC (inositolphosphoceramide), MIPC (mannose inositolphosphoceramide), and M(I P)_2C (mannose diinositolphosphoceramide) (Klug and Daum, 2014).

Following genome packaging and assembly, progeny virions leave the host cell. Both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses can induce cell death by lysis, resulting in the release of viral particles. However, viral egress pathways can also be mediated by intracellular organelles that transport new virions to the plasma membrane, allowing them to exit cells without lysis (Roth et al., 2020). Therefore, many viruses use cellular membranous organelles for replication and assembly, as well as for egress and cell-to-cell transmission (Altan-Bonnet, 2017; Bird and Kirkegaard, 2015).

Bio-protocol-1054	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4077	Analysis of Soluble Sugar Content in Minute Quantities of Rice Tissues by GC-MS	GC-MS, Soluble sugars, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose Background Sucrose, as the major product of photosynthesis in plants, is transported from sources to sinks by three steps, phloem loading, long-distance transport in phloem, and phloem unloading, which are mediated by both plasmodesmata and sugar transporters (Zhu et al., 2013; Milne et al., 2018). Sucrose is then transformed into other sugars such as glucose and fructose. These soluble sugars are involved in energy and material metabolism and signaling, plant growth and development, and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Bezrutczyk et al., 2018; Yamada and Osakabe, 2018; Wei et al., 2020). On the other hand, pests regulate plant sugar partitioning to facilitate their infection of, and damage to, plants (Hofmann et al., 2009; Ibraheem et al., 2014; Sosso et al., 2019). It is highly beneficial for researchers to understand the mechanisms of plant-pest interactions in order to investigate changes in soluble sugar content of plant tissues during pest infection or damage.

The Bunyaviridae family is composed of more than 350 viruses divided into five genera, among which Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, and Hantavirus contain species pathogenic to humans and animals, while the genus Tospovirus is pathogenic only to plants (Walter and Barr, 2011; Ly and Ikegami, 2016).

GQ formed at certain hotspots in the genome (Biffi et al., 2013; Marsico et al., 2019) play regulatory roles (Siddiqui-Jain et al., 2002; Falabella et al., 2019) and are related to certain diseases (Biffi et al., 2014; De Magis et al., 2019). R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures composed of a double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrid and a single-stranded DNA. R-loops are also related to gene regulation and genome instability (Aguilera and García-Muse 2012; Santos-Pereira and Aguilera 2015). Interestingly, GQ and R-loops are formed during transcription and often coexist (Duquette et al., 2004).

Applications of nanotechnology in plant bioengineering and nano-enabled agriculture have recently emerged (Kah et al., 2019; Lowry et al., 2019). The use of plant nanobiotechnology has great potential in developing valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tools for improving crop management, resistance to diseases and environmental stresses, targeting the delivery of agrochemicals, and genetic bioengineering tools (Wang et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2018; Giraldo et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Santana et al., 2020).

Bio-protocol-1073	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4058	Enrichment of Vascular Fragments from Mouse Embryonic Brains for Endothelial Cell Analysis Nicolas Santander* and Thomas D. Arnold*	Embryo, Brain, Vasculature, Dextran, Cholesterol Background Endothelial cells in the brain form a specialized barrier that limits and controls the passage of large and small molecules from the bloodstream into the brain (Zlokovic, 2008). In their natural niche, brain endothelial cells interact closely with several cell types, including pericytes, glia, and immune cells, which are integral to brain homeostasis (Armulik et al., 2005; Gavins et al., 2007). The study of brain endothelial cell biology has benefited greatly from the use of procedures to isolate either endothelium or vascular complexes, which include endothelial cells, pericytes, and glial contacts (radial glia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocyte endfeet). The former is normally achieved by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) isolation (Daneman et al., 2010), whereas the latter is done by centrifugation in a dextran solution (Yousif et al., 2007). FACS-based isolation can alter the properties of endothelial cells and is expensive and inefficient, leading to the isolation of very few cells that may not reflect their native state. These issues are more evident when obtaining samples from embryonic brains, where the sample is extremely limited, and fewer than 5000 endothelial cells are typically obtained from one brain. This number is adequate for transcriptional analyses using specialized kits (Santander et al., 2020) but is insufficient for biochemical assays. Conversely, dextran-based isolation of vascular complexes has not been applied to embryonic brains because the standard protocol requires a much bigger sample obtained from single mouse embryos. The ability to obtain enough sample for biochemical assays from single embryonic brains is necessary for the study of developmental vascular diseases, such as the Fowler syndrome (Santander et al., 2020). Here, to overcome these sample size issues, we describe the adaptation of the paradigm of dextran-based isolation of vascular fragments to individual mouse embryo brains. We demonstrate the utility of vascular fragment isolation to measure cholesterol content in embryonic brain blood vessels, an assay not feasible using FACS-isolated endothelial cells.

In the brain, ATP is released from neurons and glia (Pankratov et al., 2006; Butt, 2011), and is involved in neurotransmission (Burnstock, 2007), neuron–glia interaction (Fields and Burnstock, 2006; Khakh and North, 2012), and regulation of blood flow (MacVicar and Newman, 2015). Release of ATP also occurs during pathological neuronal activity known as cortical spreading depression (CSD) (Schock et al., 2007; Heinrich et al., 2012), which is associated with migraine and cerebral ischemia (Lauritzen et al., 2011). Thus, extracellular ATP signaling is considered to play key roles not only in normal brain functions but also in brain disorders.

It is made up of highly branched villous tree-like structures that are bathed in maternal blood from approximately the 10^th week of gestation (Jauniaux et al., 2000). Anchoring villi attach the placenta to the endometrium, which is transformed during placentation into the decidua. A population of fetal tissue-resident macrophages, the Hofbauer cells (HBC), are abundant within the stroma of placental villi. Early studies determined that these cells are of fetal origin based on Ychromosome detection in pregnancies with male fetuses (Kim et al., 2008). HBC are the only immune cell population on the fetal side of the placental barrier in the steady-state (Thomas et al., 2021). Accordingly, they are thought to have important roles in the regulation of placental growth and homeostasis and to act as immune sentinels, protecting the fetus from infection in utero. However, compared to other adult tissue-resident macrophages, HBC remain poorly understood. A range of protocols has been used to isolate HBC, as excellently reviewed elsewhere (Tang et al., 2011). However, a standard technique has not been established across the field. Many of the protocols used are suboptimal for the isolation of tissue macrophages. For example, unnecessarily long digestion times (sometimes up to 3h ) and the failure to use DNase I greatly affect HBC viability. Furthermore, HBC are typically isolated as total C D14^+ cells from placental tissue for phenotypic and functional analysis. However, we have previously shown that maternal cells can comprise up to 30% of C D14^+ cells isolated from first-trimester placental digests (Thomas et al., 2021). By adding common HLA allotype antibodies to our flow cytometry panel, we can distinguish maternal from fetal cells and ensure the isolation of a pure population of HBC. Therefore, in all future research of HBC using in vitro assays, additional steps that are described here should be performed to ensure that true fetally-derived HBC are studied with optimal viability.

Hence, regulated secretion is critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis in animals. Examples include the release of insulin after a meal, the release of mucin in response to pathogenic microorganisms, and the release of sweat during elevated body temperature. These biologically active molecules are produced by endocrine or exocrine cells and stored in long-lasting secretory organelles termed secretory granules.

The first SEM came on the market in 1965 when the Cambridge Instrument Company launched a commercial instrument (McMullan, 1995). Specifically, biological samples must be dehydrated before entering the SEM chamber (Echlin, 1971),  otherwise  water  vapor  contaminates  the  electron  microscope  vacuum  system.  Before cryopreservation was invented, freeze-drying and critical point drying were two commonly used methods (Sargent, 1986). These pretreatments were inevitably associated with sample distortion, shrinkage, or loss of inner cellular soluble components (Reference 1; Echlin, 1971); additionally, they were timeconsuming and laborious.
Bio-protocol-1095	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4036	Muscle Cryoinjury and Quantification of Regenerating Myofibers in Mice	Muscle injuries, Cryoinjury, Muscle regeneration, Myofiber regeneration Background Muscle injuries are a common type of injury that can result from various causes, from exertion to blast trauma. These injuries lead to a complex cascade of inflammatory and regenerative responses that result in the repair of the injured tissues. To characterize muscle injuries and the following responses and to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments, various experimental models have been developed to replicate the process of muscle injury. In vitro approaches offer some practical advantages, and the advancement in 3D culture technique has enabled bioengineering of human cell-derived muscle tissue surrogates that may be used in muscle injury studies (Mills et al., 2017). In vivo models, however, remain imperative to understanding muscular injuries, as the complex processes involving the local and systemic responses that govern the overall regenerative process and the accompanying functional impairments/recovery can only be observed in a whole system of organisms. Rodent models of muscle injury are well-established and the most used systems for studying muscle regeneration today.

The wide variety of factors that affect male fertility, both genetic and environmental (Oliva et al., 2001; Huynh et al., 2002), make studies in humans susceptible to confounding influences. Model systems can be useful in investigating the influence of single factors on various aspects of fertility. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically tractable organism with a defined number of cells and germ cells that can be examined phenotypically.

In combination with in/ex utero and ex vivo genetic manipulation techniques e.g., electroporation (Tabata and Nakajima, 2003; Namba et al., 2014), virus transfection (Noctor et al., 2001), and microinjection (Taverna et al., 2012), the slice/tissue culture methods allow the investigation of cell behavior by time-lapse imaging (Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2001; Tabata and Nakajima, 2003; Namba et al., 2011 and 2014; Taverna et al., 2012; Betizeau et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2018; Long et al., 2018; Nakagawa et al., 2019), signaling pathways by studying the effects of pharmacological reagents (Schenk et al., 2009; Long et al., 2018; Kalebic et al., 2019; Namba et al., 2020), and brain tissue development by immunohistochemistry (Schenk et al., 2009; Long et al., 2018; Güven et al., 2020; Namba et al., 2020) (Figure 1). In the present protocol, we describe three different methods to study developing neocortical tissue: (i) organotypic slice culture (Taverna et al., 2012); (ii) hemisphere rotation (HERO) culture (Schenk et al., 2009); and (iii) free-floating tissue (FFT) culture (Long et al., 2018).

The activation of naïve C D4^+ T cells, by antigen-presenting cells that offer cognate antigens, initiates various differentiation programs that lead to the development of highly specialized T helper (T_H) cell lineages (Bhaumik and Basu 2017). T_H17 cells are a subset of pro-inflammatory  T_H cells defined by the production of interleukin 17 (IL-17) (Hartigan-O'Connor et al., 2011). To date, at least two different types of T_H17 have been described. Type 1, pathogenic or disease-inducing T_H17 (T_H17p) cells, are induced by the combined IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23 cytokine stimulation, and produce IL-17 together with IFN-γ, which results in tissue inflammation and autoimmunity (Cua et al., 2003; Awasthi et al., 2009; Jager et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014). Type 2, non-pathogenic T_H17 (T_H17n) cells, are induced by TGF-  and IL-6 in vitro, and produce IL-17 but are not able to induce effective tissue inflammation or autoimmunity. T_H17n cells play a protective role in mucosal tissues, promoting tissue homeostasis as well as maintaining barrier function (Bettelli et al., 2008; Ouyang et al., 2008; Korn et al., 2009; Guglani and Khader 2010; Gaffen et al., 2011). Here, we report a simple and robust protocol for generating non-pathogenic T_H17 (T_H17n) cells in vitro.

This has been accomplished in rats using alcohol (Vendruscolo and Roberts, 2014; de Guglielmo et al., 2017), nicotine (Smith et al., 2020), cannabis (Freels et al., 2020; Muthusamy, 2020), and opioids such as sufentanil (Vendruscolo et al., 2018), fentanyl (McConnell et al., 2020), and heroin (Gutierrez et al., 2020). We recently adapted this model and developed a mouse model of opioid vapor self-administration using fentanyl (Moussawi et al., 2020), the protocol for which is described in this manuscript.
Bio-protocol-1109	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4022	A New Method for Studying RNA-binding Proteins on Specific RNAs	Proximity-based protein labeling, CRUIS, RNA-binding protein, PUP-IT, CRISPR Background RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in regulating cellular processes and function. Mapping RNA-protein interactions is a key endeavor to address how proteins regulate the location and function of target RNAs. The traditional methods are mostly protein-centric methods, including RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP). They rely on specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate RNA-protein complexes and identify the RNAs by sequencing. Although some RNA-centric methods have been developed, they focused on systematic labeling of all RNAs, rather than one specific RNA, for the purification of RNA-protein complexes (Chu et al., 2015; McHugh et al., 2015). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a method that can be widely used to study RNA-protein interactions of the specific RNA in living cells. Since the CRISPRbased RNA-targeting Cas nucleases have been reported, it provides us a new powerful tool to bind and cleave specific RNAs to regulate RNA function (Abudayyeh et al., 2016; Cox et al., 2017). In addition, the enzymatically deactivated Cas13a provides a new strategy for tracking the specific RNA. The proximity labeling system PUP-IT has been widely used to identify protein-protein interactions. It employs the proximity ligase PafA to mediate the ligation of a small protein (PupE) to lysines on the surrounding proteins (Liu et al., 2018). Combining PUP-IT with the RNA-targeting Cas nucleases (Figure 1), we have developed a new class of RNA-centric methods for studying RNA-protein interactions in living cells (Zhang et al., 2020).
Bio-protocol-1110	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4021	Intracellular IRF5 Dimerization Assay	IRF5, Native-PAGE, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, FRET, Dimerization, Molecular interaction, IRF5-CPP Background Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that regulates pathogeninduced innate and acquired immune responses downstream of Toll-like receptor (TLR), retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and B cell receptor (BCR) (De et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2018; Banga et al., 2020). IRF5 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus due to its role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12 and pathogenic autoantibody production (Song et al., 2020). In an unstimulated condition, IRF5 is generally localized in the cytoplasm as a monomer (Thompson et al., 2018). Activation of the above receptors triggers cellular signaling cascades. IRF5 undergoes post-translational modification, which eventually leads to homodimerization, a critical event prior to nuclear translocation (Thompson et al., 2018). Here, we describe two methods designed for detecting IRF5 molecular interactions.

This poses challenges in recombinant bacterial protein overexpression as the reducing environment can prevent the correct formation of critical disulphide bonds in proteins that require them for structure and/or function (Kadokura and Beckwith, 2010). As such, these proteins are often expressed by E_ : coli into insoluble inclusion bodies (Berkmen, 2012) that renders them unusable. In favourable cases, proteins from inclusion bodies can be refolded in vitro after solubilising in strong denaturants (Qin et al., 2015). However, this is typically a lengthy and reagent consuming process and the yield of the correctly refolded protein is variable.

Five Schistosoma species can cause parasitosis and are distributed in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. There are two distinct forms of the disease: urogenital, caused by Schistosoma haematobium; and intestinal, caused by Schistosoma intercalatum, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, and Schistosoma mansoni (Uberos and Jerez-Calero, 2012; World Health Organization, 2018). Humans are infected following contact with cercariae released from infected aquatic snails. Here, we focus on the S. mansoni species. After entering a mammalian host, cercariae differentiate into schistosomula (Hitchcock, 1949; de Waard and Vermeulen, 1961; Stirewalt, 1974), which migrate to intrahepatic vessels and develop in adults (Armstrong, 1965; Miller and Wilson, 1980). After mating, the adult worms migrate to the mesenteric veins, where they complete their development and start laying eggs after the 35^th day of infection. A female adult worm lays about 300 eggs per day, which reach tissues and the intestinal lumen and are eliminated along with the feces to the external environment (Moore and Sandground, 1956; Gryseels et al., 2006). However, some eggs become trapped in the liver and induce the formation of granulomatous lesions (Espírito Santo et al., 2008; King and DangerfieldCha, 2008), which can lead to fibrosis in host tissues and the promotion of injuries and complications that cause anemia, malnutrition, and loss of quality of life, having a high socioeconomic impact (Burke et al., 2009; Olveda et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-1116	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4015	Characterising Plant Deubiquitinases with in vitro Activity-based Labelling and Ubiquitin Chain	Ubiquitin, Deubiquitinase, Ubiquitin vinyl sulfone, Proteasome, Cell signaling, Proteostasis Background Regulation of cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis), the intricate balance between protein synthesis, modification, and degradation, is essential for the survival of all organisms (Balch et al., 2008). Proteostasis is maintained by a diverse range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that increase the size and functionality of proteomes (Skelly et al., 2016). Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of the small regulatory protein ubiquitin to target proteins, is a prevalent PTM involved in numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. Ubiquitin is conjugated predominantly to lysine residues of target substrates via its C-terminus, which requires the sequential actions of three types of enzyme; E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysine residues that can also be modified, facilitating formation of polyubiquitin chains of various linkage types. Different ubiquitin chain topologies have specific signalling roles and are associated with different cellular processes. For example, K48-linked chains generally target proteins for degradation by the proteasome, a large multi-protein complex that is responsible for the majority of proteolytic activity in eukaryotic cells. However, ubiquitin modifications can also be reversed by the action of a wide range of deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes with diverse specificities for different ubiquitin linkage types (Mevissen and Komander, 2017). Since deubiquitination determines the stability, activity, or function of proteins, entire proteomes can be shaped by the activities of specific DUBs. Many human diseases, including cancers, are associated with dysregulated DUB activity, demonstrating the physiological and pathological importance of these enzymes (Harrigan et al., 2018; Clague et al., 2019). To understand DUB function, their activity can be analysed by various in vitro methods to determine substrate specificity and regulation of activity (Cho et al., 2020). These methods include activity-based protein profiling using synthetic ubiquitin suicide probes that irreversibly label DUB active sites (Borodovsky et al., 2002; Gong et al., 2018; Schauer et al., 2020), as well as assays in which purified ubiquitin chains are incubated with DUBs and chain disassembly is monitored by western blotting or gel staining. Recently, we used these methods to uncover the signalling roles of the Arabidopsis thaliana proteasome-associated deubiquitinases, UBP6 and UBP7, in plant immunity (Skelly et al., 2019). Here, we describe protocols for analysing recombinant UBP6 activity by HA-UbVS labelling and in vitro deubiquitination assays. Importantly, these methods can be applied to any DUB of interest and in the case of HA-UbVS, labelling can also be applied to protein extracts from any organism to uncover proteome-wide DUB activity. Characterising the activity and regulation of DUBs is vital to understand how these enzymes act in vivo and will advance the fields of ubiquitin signalling and proteostasis across eukaryotes.

The exact host consequences of bacteria that swarm are not yet fully known; however, recent research has aimed to elucidate such a role in pathogenesis (Barak et al., 2009). It has been theorized that swarming enables bacteria to adhere to and disperse from localized spots of infection (Kearns, 2010), as well as to escape engulfment by macrophages (Amendola, 1998). For instance, the swarming of Proteus mirabilis has been implicated in catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Jones et al., 2004). Moreover, bacteria of many species become resistant to a range of antibiotics when they swarm, in a manner that appears unrelated to normal antibiotic efflux mechanisms (Butler et al., 2010).

The unprecedented spread of the disease has placed healthcare systems under considerable pressure, particularly in efforts to detect cases as efficiently as possible, contain the disease, and treat cases in a timely manner. Disease surveillance and the confirmation of positive COVID-19 cases has also mostly relied upon quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens for the detection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) following WHO guidelines (Corman et al., 2020). However, the RT-qPCR testing capacity can be highly variable, particularly in rural areas, where primary healthcare facilities may not have trained personnel or the necessary equipment and facilities to carry out confirmatory testing. Hence, samples are sent to centralized facilities, which in turn are met with an overwhelmingly high demand for testing. As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, these laboratories have begun to face a backlog of pending tests and rising turnaround times that affect the clinical utility of results and timely surveillance of populations at the greatest risk.

For example, proteins and oligonucleotides adopt structures that provide interaction sites or binding pockets for metal ions, organic ligands, and other oligonucleotides or proteins. Upon complex formation, the structure of the biomacromolecule may change, and it is this structural change that is the basis for function; thus, methods are needed that enable resolution of the structures along the trajectory of the conformational change. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electron microscopy (EM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical trap, and magnetic tweezers are powerful methods for obtaining the structures of biomolecules at atomic resolution (Salas et al., 2015; Lottspeich and Engels, 2018; Geffroy et al., 2018); yet, they also have their limitations. X-ray crystallography requires the biomolecule to be crystallized  and  is,  as  EM,  limited  in  providing  information  on  dynamics  and  conformational intermediates. NMR spectroscopy can follow the dynamics of biomolecules since it is performed in liquid solution, but is limited with respect to the size of the biomolecule. Complementary to these techniques, fluorescence microscopy (FM), Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are biophysical methods that allow resolution of the dynamics of structural changes without size restriction and in solution (Yang et al., 2012; Lottspeich and Engels,
Bio-protocol-1128	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4003	ATAC-Seq-based Identification of Extrachromosomal Circular DNA in Mammalian Cells and Its Validation Using Inverse PCR and FISH	Circular DNA, eccDNA, ATAC-seq, Inverse PCR, FISH Background Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are unique DNA molecules that carry genetic information in addition to the chromosomal DNAs. These eccDNAs have been found in different organisms from yeast to humans (Shibata et al., 2012; Dillon et al., 2015; Møller et al., 2016; Kumar  et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2020). The length of eccDNAs ranges from small (less than 1kb, also called microDNAs) to large (megabase-long). While the small eccDNAs with micro homology ends may promote genetic heterogeneity (Shibata et al., 2012) or produce short RNAs if transcribed (Paulsen et al., 2019), the long eccDNAs may harbor complete genes and regulatory elements such as enhancers (Morton et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Koche et al., 2020). Emerging evidence suggests that eccDNAs could play underappreciated roles in regulating gene expression and genome instability, which ultimately contributes to the selective advantage of cells (Gresham et al. 2010, Koo et al., 2018; Hull et al., 2019). In particular, oncogene-carrying eccDNAs are highly amplified in human cancers and correlate with open chromatin, increased oncogene expression, and chromosome structural rearrangement, in addition to being associated with poor outcomes (Wu et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Koche et al., 2020). Uncovering eccDNAs in the circulation also makes them prospective targets for diagnostic purposes (Kumar et al., 2017; Sin et al., 2020).

Recently, SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of coronavirus, has been identified as the causal pathogen for the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Huang et al., 2020). The infectious disease that first originated in Wuhan, China, spread to other nations at an alarmingly rapid pace. With 3,517,345 cases reported globally and a death toll of 243,401 (as of 5^th May 2020), the disease continues to be a public health concern and a potential threat to the socio-economic welfare of nations and healthcare systems worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020.

The development of the mammary gland is a highly dynamic process that occurs mainly after birth and is regulated by several factors including hormones and growth factors (Brisken and Rajaram, 2006; Sternlicht, 2006). During puberty, hormones and growth factors regulate ductal morphogenesis from a rudimentary embryonic ductal tree (Brisken and O'Malley, 2010). During each pregnancy, the mammary gland begins a new morphogenetic step initiated by hormonal stimulation, which is characterized by massive proliferation for epithelial expansion and alveolar development accompanied by adipocyte regression (Brisken and O'Malley, 2010). Importantly, prolactin signaling plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of luminal cells to enable milk production (Ormandy et al., 1997). At the end of lactation after weaning of the progeny, the mammary gland enters the involution stage characterized by programmed cell death, tissue remodeling, and redifferentiation of adipocytes (Hughes and Watson, 2012; Macias and Hinck, 2012; Zwick et al., 2018; Jena et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1140	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3991	Measuring Cytosolic Translocation of Mycobacterium marinum in RAW264.7 Macrophages with	CCF4-AM, Mycobacterium marinum, EsxA, EsxB, FRET Background The development of a  -lactamase reporter assay gave rise to the subsequent Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay (Zlokarnik et al., 1998; Cavrois et al., 2002). Two fluorescence dyes, hydroxycoumarin (donor) and fluorescein (acceptor), are linked via a CCF4-AM (CCF2-AM in earlier reports)  -lactam ring. When excited at 405n m , hydroxycoumarin emits at 450n m (blue), which subsequently excites fluorescein to emit at 527 nm (green). Cleavage of the  -lactam ring by bacteriaassociated  -lactamase results in loss of FRET and direct emission of hydroxycoumarin (blue) (Jones and Padilla-Parra, 2016). The CCF4-AM FRET reporter assay is versatile and has been been used for a variety of different applications, such as tracking molecular fusions (Jones and Padilla-Parra, 2016; Shaikh, et al., 2019), tracking delivery of biological cargos to the cytosol (Stone et al., 2018), and monitoring translocation of bacteria within cells (Charpentier and Oswald, 2004). Since Mycobacterium marinum also possesses  -lactamase (Flores et al., 2005), Simeone and colleagues exploited the FRET assay to track cytosolic translocation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in THP-1 cells (Simeone et al., 2012). Recently, we applied this method for investigation of the role of EsxAB in cytosolic translocation of Mycobacterium marinum (Acosta et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Aguilera et al., 2020). RAW264.7 cells were infected with M. marinum and the results were obtained under a fluorometer, providing a quick, quantitative method for analysis of results. Furthermore, as Mycobacterium marinum is a BSL-2 pathogen and contains similarities in its ESX-1 locus (Tobin and Ramakrishnan, 2008), it provides a safe, direct way to investigate the EsxAB complex. Here we describe our procedure for direct monitoring of cytosolic translocation of Mycobacterium marinum in RAW264.7 cells via the CCF4-AM FRET assay using a fluorometer.

The mTOR kinase occupies the central stage of this signaling pathway and its activation/inhibition depends on a myriad of environmental cues, including nutrient availability, growth factors, energy status and various stresses. mTOR signaling is regulated by complex and sometimes redundant mechanisms depending on cellular type and context. As expected given its central role in cellular homeostasis, many if not all human physiopathological conditions involve mTOR signaling to some degree or will at least interfere with its activation/regulation at some stage of their progression. The mTOR kinase belongs to several multiprotein complexes, including mTORC1 and mTORC2, which exhibit distinct cellular functions and substrate specificities. The mTORC1 complex primarily controls cell growth and anabolism pathways, whereas the mTORC2 complex is involved in regulation of cellular metabolism (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017). Efforts are underway to better investigate mTOR signaling and activation modes in several cell types. To this end, specific tools are required to accurately monitor mTOR kinase activity in living cells in real time.

Bio-protocol-1147	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3984	Improved Macrophage Isolation from Mouse Skeletal Muscle	Macrophage, CD11b, Skeletal muscle, Aging, Senescence Background Macrophages were discovered by Metchnikoff and colleagues more than a century ago as ‘professional’ phagocytes (Underhill et al., 2016). Later studies revealed that macrophages constitute a heterogenous class of cells that exert diverse functions in tissues throughout the body (Wynn et al., 2013). Macrophages can be divided into two major types: tissue-resident and non-tissue-resident macrophages (Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016). Tissue-resident macrophages can be further divided into two distinct populations: embryo-derived self-renewing and bone marrow-derived non-self-renewing macrophages. Typical self-renewing macrophages derived from the embryonic yolk sac or fetal liver include microglia, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, and Langerhans cells. Bone marrow-derived non-self-renewing resident macrophages, which must be replenished by circulating monocytes at tissuespecific levels, include tissue-resident macrophages in the intestine, pancreas, and dermis (Chakarov et al., 2019). Non-resident macrophages are derived from bone marrow progenitor cells and infiltrate tissues following injury or infection (Kratofil et al., 2016).

Continuous cell generation is primarily achieved by globose progenitor cells (Jang et al., 2014). Progenitor cells also have the potential to reconstitute all OE cell types after injury, with horizontal basal cells having the greatest tissue stem cell potential (Leung et al., 2007; Schnittke et al., 2015; Gadye et al., 2017).

As such, knowledge of the neurobiology of small molecule-induced behavioral changes and elucidation of their underlying mechanisms will further our understanding of the functional mechanisms of neural circuits. However, most previous behavioral studies used mice or rats as a model, and a significant amount of resources is required to complete such studies. Drosophila have been used as a tractable genetic model to investigate many genetic disorders (Mackay and Anholt, 2006), and in recent years their use as a model for behavioral studies has become increasingly common (Zhukovskaya et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Hampel et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2015; Pitmon et al., 2016; Hidalgo et al., 2017).

While some rhizobacteria have no observable effects on plants, others are either pathogens that cause detrimental effects or growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) that promote plant vigor (Mendes et al., 2013; Olanrewaju et al., 2019). The capacity of bacterial pathogens or PGPR to impact plant growth is tightly correlated with their level of bacterial root colonization. Therefore, the investigation of bacterial root colonization is an important stepping stone to understanding the belowground plant-bacteria interactions.

In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 is active and phosphorylates a wide array of proteins to drive protein and ribosome synthesis, activate lipid and nucleotide synthesis, tune nitrogen and amino acid metabolism/transport, and repress autophagy (Kamada et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Loewith and Hall, 2011; Peterson et al., 2011; Robitaille et al., 2013; Ben-Sahra et al., 2016; Gonzalez and Hall, 2017; Ben-Sahra and Manning, 2017; Liu and Sabatini, 2020). In contrast, when cells are exposed to stress or starvation conditions, TORC1 is inactivated to limit cell growth and redirect available resources to the appropriate stress or starvation response (Barbet et al., 1996; Duvel et al., 2010).

Researchers have now developed this system into a key tool for targeted genome editing. CRISPR – binary vectors express two elements – the sgRNAs with a target sequence (target-sgRNAs) and Cas9 protein – to cleave target genomic regions. Feng et al. (2013) have constructed gateway vectors to co-express Cas9 and sgRNAs in plants through Agrobacterium sp.-mediated transformation. In a restriction-ligation reaction, a gene-specific sgRNA spacer substitutes the target region in the entry clone, which encodes attL recombination sites. Then, an “LR Clonase” reaction transfers the target-sgRNA cassette into a destination clone, which contains a Cas9 expression cassette (Feng et al., 2013). Ma et al. (2016) have developed this basic system into a CRISPR/Cas9 system for multiplex genome editing in rice. In this approach, a restrictionligation reaction inserts a spacer into intermediate vectors to produce an sgRNA expression cassette, which fuses with adaptors for Golden Gate cloning or Gibson Assembly (Ma et al., 2016). In an alternative approach, an overlapping PCR, with two rounds of reactions, can also establish a sgRNA expression cassette with adaptors. The sgRNA expression cassette can then be introduced into a binary vector via Golden Gate cloning or Gibson Assembly (Ma et al., 2016). However, traditional cloning, based on restriction-ligation reactions or two-round overlapping PCRs, is time-consuming.

Since these donations are scarce, alternatives based on the tissue engineering of biomaterials are desirable. A wide range of strategies and materials are being developed to engineer corneal tissue, and one promising approach is the use of decellularized animal corneas (Fernández-Pérez and Ahearne, 2020) to provide a collagenproteoglycan scaffold upon which the cells can grow. Decellularized porcine corneas have been approved as implant material in trials for the treatment of corneal ulcers, with encouraging clinical outcomes (Zhang et al., 2015, Zheng et al., 2019). However, after implantation, repopulation of the acellular implant by the migration of cells from the recipient can result in corneal haze or permanent scar tissue (Li et al., 2020). To avoid this problem, the decellularized cornea can be repopulated in vitro with cells prior to implantation. To achieve this and ensure high cell density, cells can be injected into the decellularized cornea, but this can damage the collagen architecture. Alternatively, cells seeded directly onto the scaffolds are slow to migrate into the tissue and their phenotype can be adversely affected. Our tactic is therefore to combine the decellularized corneal sheets with a high density of keratocytes in a collagen hydrogel to engineer the corneal stroma. In this protocol, we describe a way of fabricating corneal equivalents by stacking thin sheets of decellularized porcine corneas interleaved with cell-laden collagen hydrogels. These constructs have high cell viability, display characteristic stromal markers and are robust enough to be sutured in an ex vivo model (Fernández-Pérez et al., 2020). Whilst this protocol has been developed for the cornea, other researchers have reported a similar approach to produce tissue engineered cartilage (Gong et al., 2010).
Bio-protocol-1169	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3962	Investigate Synaptic Vesicles Mobility in Neuronal Culture Axons by FRAP Imaging	Synaptic vesicle, Membrane trafficking, Live-cell imaging, FRAP, Axonal transport, Synapse Background Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are key organelles involved in neurotransmission through the storage and release of neurotransmitters. SVs are mostly identified in a cluster adjacent to the active zone of the presynaptic terminals. SVs have a homogeneous appearance with a diameter of 40-50 nm under electron microscopy (EM) (Landis et al., 1988; Korogod et al., 2015). While, to our knowledge, there is no significant biochemical distinction between SVs. Under different stimulation paradigms, they show different release properties. Thus, SVs were classified into different functional pools: the reserve pool, the recycling pool and the readily releasable pool (Figure 1) (Denker and Rozzoli, 2010). The detailed synapse structure, SV localization, SV release mechanisms were intensively studied with EM. SVs were found linked to one or two neighboring vesicles by filaments, and synapsins were thought to be part of the connector and maintain the SVs in the reserve pool (Siksou et al., 2007). The dissection of molecular steps for SVs docking and fusion was also revealed by ultrastructure study (Imig et al., 2014). The fusion of SV with the plasma membrane exposes the acidic lumen (pH around 5.0) to the neutral extracellular medium (pH of 7.4) (Südhof, 1995). Therefore, SVs recycling and related molecular mechanisms were also intensively studied by labeling SVs with pH sensors (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000; Soykan et al., 2017).

Through this pathway, proteins mature by trafficking from the ER and along the different Golgi stacks until they reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where they are finally sorted and packed into vesicles that will be delivered to other organelles within the cell, or to the extracellular milieu (Glick and Luini, 2011; Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019).

Bio-protocol-1175	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3956	Quantitative Measurement of Mucolytic Enzymes in Fecal Samples	Mucus, Mucin, Mucolytic enzymes, Mucus degrading bacteria Background The gastrointestinal tract (GI) is home for trillions of microorganisms which play diverse functions in the physiological processes (Sommer and Backhed, 2011). Commensal gut microbiota process undigested food, provide energy, nutrients and vitamins, activate the immune system, and prevent pathogens from infecting the intestinal mucosal tissue (Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Pickard et al., 2017). Despite these beneficial roles, gut commensal microorganisms may act as opportunistic pathogens when they get the opportunity to colonize intestinal epithelial barrier and invade into the mucosal tissue. However, a gel like mucus layer above the apical surface of the epithelial cells throughout the intestinal tract ensures physical separation of commensal microbes from the intestinal mucosal tissue and helps maintain intestinal homeostasis (Pullan et al., 1994; Linden et al., 2008; Atuma et al., 2011; Johansson et al., 2011; Juge, 2012). In the large intestine, mucus barrier is very thick, about 700 nm, and can be divided into two distinct layers – a thick outer layer and a thin inner layer (Johansson et al., 2008 and 2011). While the outer layer is nutrient rich, easy to be dislodged, and often colonized with anaerobic bacteria, the inner layer is firmly attached to the epithelial layer and is mostly sterile (Johansson et al., 2008 and 2011).

Each of the approximately 10^13 body cells suffers tens of thousands to about 100,000 damages to its DNA per day (Janion, 2001; Jackson and Bartek, 2009). 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the most common oxidative DNA damages induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). By oxidizing the base guanine to 7,8-dihydro8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoG, in contrast to guanine, is now able to hybridize not only with cytosine but also with adenine. This can lead to a complete base exchange after the second replication and thus trigger serious mutations. The replacement of a guanine/cytosine base pair by thymine/adenine is one of the most frequent mutations in human cancer. This so-called transversion also occurs frequently in the tumor suppressor gene p53 (Hirano, 2008). For this reason, and based on the fact that between 1,000 and 2,000 8-oxoG lesions per day occur in a healthy cell, while in tumor cells the number of 8-oxoG lesions increases up to 1,000,000, 8-oxoG is considered to be one of the major causes of cancer (Ravanat et al., 2000; Nakabeppu, 2014). Furthermore, 8-oxoG is associated with aging processes and degenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) (Sampath et al., 2012; Nakabeppu, 2014) and thus shows great pathophysiological relevance.

Azam3, Amanda E. D. Van Swearingen3, Elizabeth Wayne1, Sloane Christian Fussell4, Marina Sokolsky-Papkov1, Chad V. Pecot3, 5, 6, * and Alexander V.	Xenograft, Immune-competent, Immune-deficient, Orthotopic, Syngeneic Background NSCLC has a poor prognosis because most patients have advanced stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis, and patients with early-stage tumors are very likely to encounter post-surgical metastasis and recurrence (Zappa and Mousa, 2016; Renaud et al., 2016). Transplanted tumors grown subcutaneously in immune-deficient nude mice do not faithfully recapitulate the metastatic disease, and therefore, better models are needed (Manzotti et al., 1993). The 344SQ LUAD cell line forms spontaneous metastasis due to the suppression of the microRNA-200 (miR-200) expression, resulting in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype having increased motility (Chen et al., 2014). Moreover, with a considerably low number of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the Kras/p53 mutant LUAD model exhibits an 'immunologically cold' phenotype. The low number of anticancer lymphocytes renders it less receptive to treatments like anti-PD1 that depends on pre-existing T cells, making it an ideal model to test alternative strategies for the treatment of “immunologically cold tumors” (Pfirschke et al., 2016; Espinosa et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-1179	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3952	Ligand and Carbohydrate Engagement (LACE) Assay and Fluorescence Quantification on	Ligand, Carbohydrate, LACE, Heparan Sulphate, HSPG, FGF, FGFR Background Heparan sulphate (HS) is an extracellular matrix and cell surface glycosaminoglycan molecule that is extensively modified by sulphation. HS interacts with a wide range of developmentally important signaling molecules including FGFs, Wnts, BMPs and Slits. During FGF signalling, for example, HS acts as a co-receptor, facilitating the binding of the FGF ligand to the cell surface FGFR receptor. The formation of this FGF:FGFR:HS complex is required for FGF signaling to occur (Allen   et al., 2001). Differential sulphation of HS has been shown to affect the binding of FGF ligands to their FGFR cell surface receptors. In our recent paper we used a ligand and carbohydrate engagement (LACE) assay to probe the interaction between HS and FGF proteins (Clegg et al., 2019). This method involves the addition of recombinant FGF and FGFR protein to form the FGF:FGFR:HS complex on tissue sections. The recombinant FGFR can then be labelled using a fluorescently conjugated antibody allowing the visualization of the binding event (Allen et al., 2001; Allen and Rapraeger., 2003).
Bio-protocol-1180	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3951	Liposomal Clodronate-mediated Macrophage Depletion in the Zebrafish Model	Liposomes, Clodronate, Larva injection, Macrophage depletion, Zebrafish, Innate Immunity Background Macrophages are key constituents of the innate immune system and play important roles in response to infections, sterile inflammation, and environmental changes. One of the most effective ways to uncouple the functions of macrophages from a complex mix of interacting cell types in different physiological contexts is to be able to specifically eliminate macrophages and analyze the phenotypic consequence. Such depletion experiments in mice have provided much insight into the role of macrophages (Hua et al., 2018; Rosowski, 2020). However, our understanding of macrophage functions remains incomplete, and cell depletion experiments in the mouse model are difficult to track and validate in real time. For these reasons, the optical transparency and ease of manipulation of larval zebrafish offer clear advantages for highly traceable and tractable cell ablation in vivo by imaging the target cells in real time and in the whole intact organism. Zebrafish genes and immune system also share a high degree of orthology with those of the human (Yoder et al., 2002; Santoriello et al., 2012; Howe et al., 2013). Furthermore, the adaptive immune system of zebrafish does not become functionally mature until juvenile adult stages (Lam et al., 2004), making the larval zebrafish an excellent platform to study the innate immune system independent of the adaptive immune contributions.
Bio-protocol-1181	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3950	Monitoring Real-time Temperature Dynamics of a Short RNA Hairpin Using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer and Circular Dichroism	RNA structure, Temperature, FRET, CD spectroscopy Background RNA is the central molecule in gene expression in all extant life, serving as the messenger. It is also central to biocatalysis, playing a key role in ribosome assembly and function. Ultimately, RNA function is regulated by its structure and there is a seemingly limitless variety of structures that allows for diverse functions. RNA molecules can form both inter- and intramolecular Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs, which lead to the formation of secondary structures such as hairpins, apical and internal loops, 3-way-junctions or pseudoknots (Cruz and Westhof, 2009). Such secondary structures can impart catalytic activity, serve as molecular scaffolds as well as provide or occlude binding sites for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and other RNAs. Secondary structures on messenger RNA are known to affect a plethora of biological processes such as RNA stability and processing (Soemedi et al., 2017), alternative splicing (Bartys et al., 2019), subcellular localisation (Lazzaretti and Bono, 2017) and translation regulation (Jacobs et al., 2012).

In vitro testing of small molecule therapeutics or drug candidates has traditionally relied on mono-enteric cell lines. These in vitro systems do not determine the absorptive properties of the small molecule being tested, nor do they predict the behavior of these compounds in the gut. To some extent, enteroids recapitulate the complexity and diversity of the intestine, but they are an expensive system and do not always provide reproducible results due to variability in the reagents required (Blutt et al., 2018). There is an unmet need for simple experimental systems that mimic the gut epithelial layer to aid in the development of new chemical probes and drugs. Here, we focus on developing cell-based protocols to assay one intestinal signaling system, the small molecule-based activation of the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 on intestinal enteroendocrine cells.

Certain tumors are arranged hierarchically with the chemotherapy resistant tumor initiating cells (also called cancer stem cells) residing at the bottom of the cellular hierarchy as they maintain the tumor through self-renewal and differentiation (Magee et al., 2012). Plasticity of the tumor initiating cells (TICs) makes them difficult to identify, isolate and study. Heterogeneity and plasticity of energetics of TICs is only beginning to be appreciated and is far from clear (Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2017) (Intlekofer and Finley, 2019). Moreover, energetics status of TICs appears to be tumor specific, and certain TICs are dependent on mitochondrial energetics and can be eliminated by mitochondrial inhibitors (Pasto et al., 2014; Sancho et al., 2015; Viale et al., 2015; Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2017; Spurlock et al., 2019).

When applying NGS to study intra-host viral populations for RNA viruses, modifications in library prep and sequencing protocols need to be considered. The virus titers (or viral loads) vary greatly from specimen to specimen. While conventional NGS platforms require 1-500 ng of DNA (or RNA) in a sequencing run, in most cases a clinical sample will have less than 100 fg of viral RNA, requiring that the viral RNA first be converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase, followed by one or two rounds of PCR amplification to generate enough material for sequencing. However, the extensive cycles of PCR amplification will cause nucleotide mis-incorporation, recombination and amplification bias. Furthermore, the NGS platforms have relatively high error rates adding additional uncertainty to the resulting sequences (Liu et al., 2012).

Analysis of proteins rely on technologies including electrophoresis, Western Blot, and mass spectrometry, which separate and identify proteins based on the size and charge of protein molecules. Although powerful in detecting proteins, these technologies are not sensitive to single molecules, which is required for elucidating molecular heterogeneity and precision diagnosis. Recently, several singlemolecule technologies have been developed to measure the size or charge of single biomolecules. Examples include interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) (Young et al., 2018) and plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) (Zhang et al., 2020), which quantify the size by measuring the scattered light from the molecules. Single-molecule electrometry (Ruggeri et al., 2017) and anti-Brownian electrokinetic (ABEL) trap (Wang et al., 2012) measure the charge of single molecules by monitoring single molecule motion in a potential trap. However, simultaneously measuring the size and charge on a single platform remains challenging.

Indeed, such shifts in gene expression are often responsible for driving evolutionary changes in patterning or morphology across organisms (Carroll, 2005). Therefore, insights into developmental processes are enhanced by observations of gene expression in its native context within a tissue. Approaches such as RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq rely on the destructive processing of tissues to extract RNA for gene expression analysis. RNA in situ hybridization offers the advantage of providing spatially and temporally resolved analyses of gene expression within the native tissue and cell type context. In maize and other plant species, RNA in situ hybridization has been used to probe gene function, tissue patterning, the evolutionary modification of gene expression, and corroborate single-cell expression data (Jackson et al., 1994; Whipple et al., 2010; Johnston et al., 2014; Strable et al., 2017; Knauer et al., 2019; Satterlee et al., 2020). Here, we present a method for detecting the accumulation of transcripts by RNA in situ hybridization in maize, a model genetic system and important staple crop. This protocol demonstrates the technique in shoot apex tissue sections where new leaf and stem tissue is initiated from pluripotent cell populations within the shoot apical meristem. Hybridization of an antisense antigen-tagged RNA probe to complementary RNAs within the tissue enables the qualitative detection of transcript accumulation patterns by an enzyme-conjugated antibody that catalyzes a colorimetric staining reaction. This protocol is readily adaptable to other maize tissues and is based on Jackson (1991) and Javelle and coworkers (2011).

Bio-protocol-1205	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3926	Phytophthora infestans (Late blight) Infection Assay in a Detached Leaf of Potato	Phytophthora infestans, Potato, Detached leaf assay, Late blight Background Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important non-cereal food crops in terms of food and nutritional value (Zhang et al., 2017). Late blight of potato caused by the oomycete pathogen P. infestans is one of the most devastating potato diseases in the world and is the most important yield-limiting factor in potato production (Haverkort et al., 2008 and 2016; Fisher et al., 2012). Breeding for late blight resistance is considered an important factor to fight against this disease. For this purpose, identification of novel sources of resistance in the available germplasm is a crucial step. Several testing methods such as field tests, whole plant assays, and detached leaf assays (DLA) have been developed. DLA provides increased infection and potato leaves showing more susceptibility to P. infestans than the field and whole plant assays (Stewart, 1990; Vleeshouwers et al., 1999; Vossen    et al., 2016). Since the genotype of the host and pathogen are generally static in infection assays, observed differences in susceptibility among testing methods are likely due to variation in environmental conditions. DLA is suited for identification of qualitative resistance available in the germplasm which is typically a qualitative trait governed by a single or a few disease resistant (R) genes.

Profiling the repertoire of sRNAs bound to the plant AGO during infection is the method of choice, to gain a global overview on plant-invasive pathogen sRNAs that might function through the host AGO/RISC. Antibodybased, co-immunopurification (co-IP) of plant AGO/sRNAs, the functional components of a RISC, coupled to sRNA high throughput sequencing is the gold standard to quantify silencing sRNAs in plants (Mi et al., 2008; Montgomery et al., 2008; Carbonell et al., 2012). Such approaches have led to the discovery of specifications for the binding of sRNAs to distinct members of the plant AGO protein family (Mi et al., 2008; Montgomery et al., 2008) and revealed characteristic changes of AGO-bound sRNA profiles according to plant environmental and stress responses (Zhang et al., 2011). In this context, protocols have been published describing how to co-immunopurify plant AGO/sRNAs in order to study AGO-bound, endogenous plant sRNAs under various conditions (Qi and Mi, 2009; Zhao et al., 2012; Carbonell, 2017).

Bio-protocol-1224	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3907	Isolation of Murine Primary Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells	Vascular smooth muscle cells, Murine aorta, Extraction, Isolation, Cultivation Background Cells of the blood vessel wall (mural cells) are critically involved in the regulation of several disorders, from hypertension (Rodríguez-Vita et al., 2005a) and atherosclerosis (Rodríguez-Vita et al., 2008) to cancer (Wong et al., 2020) and more recently even COVID-19 (He et al., 2020). Whereas capillaries are mostly covered by pericytes, larger blood vessels contain VSCMs in the vessel wall. Mural cells control blood flow by vasoconstriction and vasodilation. As such, they are the target of several drugs which lower blood pressure (St. Paul et al., 2020). VSMCs stabilize blood vessels and are involved in restricting vessel permeability. Mural cells also limit angiogenesis and the presence of a tight VSMCs network is a feature of mature vessels (Hungerford and Little, 1999). VSMCs can also get activated and transdifferentiated into fibroblasts which contribute to tissue fibrosis (Rodríguez-Vita et al., 2005a and 2005b). In summary, the unique role of VSCMs in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and control of blood flow makes cultured VSMCs a valuable tool in studying cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular biology.

Bio-protocol-1227	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3904	Histochemical Staining of Suberin in Plant Roots	Suberin, Fluorol Yellow, Root, Confocal microscopy Background Suberin is a complex polyester that, together with cutin and lignin, forms a physical barrier in land plants. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), suberin primarily accumulates in the cell walls of epidermal leaf cells, in the seed coat, in the periderm and in the cell wall of root endodermal cells. In the root, suberin deposition is dynamic process (Barberon et al., 2016; Andersen et al., 2018; Ursache  et  al.,  2020) that  is  modulated  by  various  nutritional  stresses,  drought  stress,  and phytohormone signaling pathways (Baxter et al., 2009; Kosma et al., 2014; Barberon et al., 2016). Suberin in root endodermal cells acts as a barrier that controls the uptake of water and nutrients (Baxter et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy et al., 2009 and 2011; Wang et al., 2019), but also provides a protective layer against various pathogens (Thomas et al., 2007; Ranathunge et al., 2008; Holbein et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Emonet et al., 2020). Moreover, suberin is also involved in periderm formation, the tissue that envelops secondary stems as part of the bark. Given its position deep within the root, it is technically challenging to study suberin. Developing a reliable tool to study the multifunctional activities of suberin and its precise localization in cells would contribute to new discoveries in many areas of plant research. A protocol for suberin staining was described previously by Lux et al. (2005) and subsequently modified over the years (Naseer et al., 2012; Fujita et al., 2020; Ursache et al., 2020). Here, we provide a standardized protocol to stain suberin and to acquire data from 10-15 roots at a single tile-scan image by confocal microscopy in a short time. This protocol will enhance the efficiency of data generation with

Bio-protocol-1229	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3902	A Versatile Protocol to Quantify BCR-mediated Phosphorylation in Human and Murine B Cell	Phosphoflow cytometry, Signal transduction, B cell receptor signaling, B cell subpopulations Background B cells are a crucial part of the adaptive immune system and play an important role in protection against pathogens. B cells can sense pathogens by innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The most important receptor for the development and activation of B cells, however, is the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). The genes encoding the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains that comprise the BCR are assembled during B cell development in the bone marrow through a stepwise process called V(D)J recombination (Tonegawa, 1983). The functionality and autoreactivity of the BCR are checked during three crucial checkpoints in B cell development: (i) productive heavy chain rearrangement is monitored at the pre-B stage by surface deposition of the heavy chain protein together with pre-existing surrogate light chain as the pre-BCR complex; (ii) productive light chain recombination enables surface expression of the BCR, which is checked for auto-reactivity at the immature B cell stage and (iii) upon bone marrow egress when transitional B cell progress to mature, naive B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. When expression of (pre-)BCR signaling molecules is altered, B cell development in the bone marrow is severely affected (Martensson et al., 2010; Pieper et al., 2013). Balanced BCR signaling is also crucial for appropriate selection, survival and activation of mature B cells and its distortion is a key factor in the development of autoimmune disease or leukemia (Nishizumi et al., 1995; Kil et al., 2012; Rip et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-1230	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3901	Carboxyfluorescein Dye Uptake to Measure Connexin-mediated Hemichannel Activity in	Connexin, Hemichannels, Carboxyfluorescein, Dye uptake Background Connexins (Cx) are integral transmembrane proteins that oligomerise into connexons at the cell surface. Connexons dock with similar hexameric protein complexes on adjacent cells to form a bidirectional conduit for gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC; Bosco et al., 2011). Gap junctions play an important role in synchronizing cellular activity and allow for the direct exchange of small ions, metabolites and secondary messengers, crucial for cellular function, survival and tissue homeostasis (Spray and Hanani, 2019). Under normal conditions, undocked connexons, known as hemichannels, remain mostly closed; however, in a pathophysiological context hemichannel-mediated intercellular communication can predominate, permitting the release of 1-2 kDa molecules, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular milieu (Solini et al., 2015; Hills et al., 2018; Taruno, 2018; Siamantouras et al., 2019). Altered hemichannel activity has previously been linked to inflammation, fibrosis and the progression of various disease states (Roy et al., 2017; Hills et al., 2018; Cea et al., 2020; Sáez et al., 2020). Consequently, quantitative characterisation of hemichannel activity can inform on the onset and progression of disease, e.g., chronic kidney disease (CKD), along with highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Price et al., 2020).

Hb is expressed in the erythrocytes and carries the oxygen from the lung to the tissues. Globin genes are differentially expressed throughout the development. For instance, during fetal life, the most abundant Hb is composed of two α- and two γ-globin chains (HbF, fetal Hb), while in human adults HbA, consisting of two α- and two  -globin chains, is predominantly expressed. Disorders caused by mutations in the  -like globin genes (  -hemoglobinopathies) represent the most frequent inherited diseases worldwide. In particular,  -hemoglobinopathies are caused by mutations that reduce adult  -globin production (  -thalassemia) or generate a mutant  -globin (sickle cell disease, SCD).

The discovery of new active metallodrugs requires the elucidation of their mode of action. Thus, for example, the targeted delivery of antiproliferative metallodrugs to malignant cells, the activation of inorganic prodrugs and the advent of nanoscience have prompted the scientists to spotlight the toxicity of them (Metzler-Nolte and Guo, 2016). Especially, the research on the design and development of new metallodrugs (either as Small Bioactive Molecules (SBAMs) or Conjugates of Metals with Drugs (CoMeDs)), includes their in vitro testing against numerous cancerous cell types and their in vivo toxicity evaluation towards model organisms (Sainis et al., 2016, Stathopoulou et al., 2018; Banti et al., 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020; Chrysouli et al., 2018a, 2018b and 2020; Latsis et al., 2018, Milionis et al., 2018; Karetsi et al., 2019; Polychronis et al., 2019; Ketikidis et al., 2020; Rossos et al., 2020). For example: When Artemia salina larvae  were  incubated  with  the  copper(II)  complex  of  amantadine  (AdNH2),  with  formula rackA d N H_3^+brackC u C l_3rbrack^- (CA) (Banti et al., 2020) or the corresponding one of the silver(I) with penicillin G (PenH) Ag(pen)(CH3OH)2 (PenAg) (Ketikidis et al., 2020) for ^24~h~ , the percentages of survival of brine shrimp larvae at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150uM of CA were (78.3pm10.2) , (85.4pm6.5) , (87.9pm9.6) , (82.6pm10.8) and (76.9pm11.9) % , respectively. The survival rate of brine shrimp larvae at the concentrations of 150 mu M , is similar with the corresponding one of the non-treated larvae, suggesting its non toxic behavior. In case of PenAg, the percentage of survival of brine shrimp larvae at 37, 74.5, 150, 220 and 1050uM are (94.7pm2.5) , (87.3pm5.0) (82.6pm4.7) , (63.4pm6.1) and (11.0pm5.0)~% , respectively, indicating toxicity at the concentration of 1050~uM . Moreover, in the case of the hydrogel which derives by the dispersion of the cluster A g_6(mu_3-H M N A)_4(mu_3-M N A)_2^2-ullet(E t_3N H)^+_2^ullet(D M S O)_2^ullet(H_2O) (AGMNA), (H_2M N A=2 -thio-nicotinic acid), in polyhydroxyethyl-methacrylate (pHEMA) (pHEMA @ AGMNA-1) (Rossos et al., 2020), no mortality rate of brine shrimp larvae was found, upon their incubation with pHEMA@AGMNA-1 for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24~h , suggesting the non-toxic behavior of the material.

They are capable of introducing new surface properties, with no changes in the material bulk characteristics. Among their functionalities, antibacterial coatings have demonstrated great importance for biomedical applications (Mateescu et al., 2015). In this sense, nanotechnology provides substantial tools for the fabrication of antibacterial coatings. Our group has achieved the synthesis of nanostructured coatings with broad spectrum bactericidal activity, without utilizing antibiotics or bacteria repelling substances (Scilletta et al., 2019). Here, only the superstructure is responsible for the bactericidal activity. To find the specific superstructure capable of bacteria killing many assays with distinct coatings configurations have been performed. All the coatings were composed of poloxamer block copolymers (also named as Pluronic®) within a titania matrix. Thus, film coatings were prepared using two copolymers which differ in the length of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions (Pluronic F127 and Pluronic P123). The quantities of the copolymers varied systematically, therefore modifying the titania:pluronic mol ratios. These modifications modulate the mesophase, which we proved is directly related to the bactericidal capacity. The mesostructured titania thin film coatings were synthesized by the sol-gel method in combination with evaporation-induced self-assembly of the pluronic micelles and deposited by spin-coating on glass substrates (Scilletta et al., 2019).

It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting 2.3% of the population over 65 years of age (Poewe et al., 2017). Patients present with resting tremors, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, along with non-motor symptoms which can include depression, anosmia and memory problems. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment that can prevent or slow the progression of PD, presenting an urgent need for an effective therapeutic (Armstrong and Okun, 2020).

During mitosis, chromosomes carrying the genetic information are equally divided into two daughter cells. The kinetochore is a key large protein complex ensuring the faithful chromosome segregation by bridging between chromosomes and spindle microtubules (Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014). Various proteins composing the kinetochore are phosphorylated by CDK1 (Gascoigne et al., 2013; Nishino et al., 2013; Hara et al., 2018b; Watanabe et al., 2019). The CDK1 phosphorylation plays critical roles in kinetochore assembly (Gascoigne et al., 2013) and also in the correct microtubule attachment (Nishino et al., 2013; Hara et al., 2018a).

Generally, in whole mount staining, the retina tissue is separate from the choroid/RPE, and each part of the separate retina and choroid/RPE is stained. Thus, the separate whole mount staining of either retina  or  choroid/RPE  does  not  address  integral  subretinal  information.  Recently,  a Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina whole mount protocol was developed (Kim et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2020). The method allows us to observe the integral and intact subretina as well as the neighboring RPE and photoreceptors. The method is also applicable to examine choroidal neovascularization from the choroid to the photoreceptor layer, but there is still a limitation in laser penetration depth of confocal microscopes, restraining the application of this protocol in animals with large eyes, which could be countered by use of light-sheet fluorescence microscope (Renier et al., 2014). Here, we illustrate the details of whole steps for immunofluorescent staining and mounting procedure of Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina using mouse eyeballs.

These behaviors are guided by dynamically changing sensory input. For example, approaching or withdrawing from an odor source causes gradual changes in the odor concentration sensed by an animal. Because odor concentration information is usually not delivered smoothly or consistently but rather unequally and/or with certain noise, the nervous systems of animals must process dynamically changing sensory stimuli properly using temporal differentiation and/or integration (Tanimoto and Kimura, 2019).

Bio-protocol-1269	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3862	Pea Aphid Rearing, Bacterial Infection and Hemocyte Phagocytosis Assay	Immune, Protocol, Phagocytosis, Aphid rearing, Bacterial infection Background Phagocytosis, defined as the cellular uptake of particles bigger than 0.5~um through formation of a membrane derived phagosome, is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of insects cellular response (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007; Melcarne et al., 2019a and 2019b). Phagocytosis is mediated by phagocytes, the dedicated cells, which can digest both “altered-self” particles and pathogens (Hillyer and Strand, 2014; Melcarne et al., 2019b). The phagocytes can be not only circulating hemocytes in hemocoel but also sessile hemocytes on tissues (Hillyer and Strand, 2014; Hillyer, 2016; Sigle and Hillyer, 2016). When pathogens enter hemocoel of insects, the phagocytes rapidly phagocytose pathogens and phagocytosis generally finishes in hours (Hillyer et al., 2003; King and Hillyer, 2012; Sigle and Hillyer, 2016).

Bio-protocol-1273	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3858	Expression and Purification of Recombinant Skd3 (Human ClpB) Protein and Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) Protease from Escherichia coli	Skd3, CLPB, Protein disaggregase, Chaperone, TEV, Protein aggregation Background Skd3 is a mitochondrial A A A+ protein that has been implicated in the multisystem mitochondrial disorder, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type VII (MGCA7) (Capo-Chichi et al., 2015; Kanabus et al., 2015; Saunders et al., 2015; Wortmann et al., 2015; Kiykim et al., 2016). The study of the biological function and the effect of these mutations on the activity of Skd3 had remained elusive due to limited ability to study Skd3 in vitro (Cupo and Shorter, 2020; Mroz et al., 2020). The challenges of studying Skd3 in vitro are threefold: (1) we have found that  S k d3 is largely insoluble when expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli. (2) Soluble fractions of Skd3 from E. coli were found to be highly proteolyzed. (3) Purification products were limited in quantity, with low microgram yields. With the protein purification scheme described herein, we are able to reproducibly purify Skd3 (and Skd3 variants) in milligram quantities to crystallography-grade purity (>95%) , thus overcoming the previous limitations of studying Skd3 in vitro (Cupo and Shorter, 2020). By harnessing biochemical assays and this purification scheme, we have shown that Skd3 is a potent mitochondrial protein disaggregase that chaperones the mitochondrial intermembrane space and maintains the solubility of proteins such as HAX1 and MICU2 (Cupo and Shorter, 2020). Furthermore, we have found that MGCA7-linked mutations disrupt Skd3 disaggregase activity (but not necessarily ATPase activity) in a manner that correlates with the clinical severity of the mutation (Cupo and Shorter, 2020).

Research focusing on rare genetic bone disorders not only has the potential to find treatment for patients, but also contributes to a better understanding of skeletal  biology.  Many  skeletal  diseases  involve  dysfunctional  osteoclasts,  osteoblasts  and/or osteocytes (Chen, 2014). Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells and osteoblasts are bone forming cells. Osteocytes are derived from mature osteoblasts and are entrapped in the bone matrix that they produce (Bonewald, 2011). Bone marrow stromal cells (mesenchymal osteoblast-like cells) can be cultured from bone marrow, bone biopsies or bone excised during surgical procedures. Mesenchymal cells are proliferative and can be differentiated and passaged. The myelomonocytic population in bone marrow and peripheral blood can be differentiated into osteoclasts by culturing with human macrophage stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) (Chen et al., 2011). However, once differentiated, these cells are terminally differentiated and can be used for experiments only once.

One of the resistance problems is the efflux of xenobiotic molecules, such as ivermectin (IVM), out of the nematode cells by the transmembrane transporter P-glycoproteins (P-gps). IVM is an anthelmintic drug with wide-ranging activity against ecto- and endoparasites in the livestock industry (Whittaker et al., 2017; Reyes-Guerrero et al., 2020). The present protocol describes the methodology to identify IVM resistance in the laboratory in the blood-feeding nematode Haemonchus contortus, both resistant and susceptible to IVM, a biological model that represents other gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) with IVM resistance problems. The first study is conducted to determine the lethal effect of IVM on H. contortus infective larvae (L3) in order to improve the standardization of the in vitro assay conditions, using a specific IVM diluent to preserve the motility of control larvae and the toxicity of IVM during the experimental assays. The second study is to establish the relative expression analysis of 10P -gp genes of H. contortus through RT-qPCR (Reyes-Guerrero et al., 2020). The H. contortus nematode obtained from the donor sheep is used as biological material to perform parasitological techniques to achieve better nucleic acid purification. Unsheathed H. . contortus L3 are used with the understanding that other protocols work with L3 after the second moult.

Although no mRNA drugs are marketed, the efficacy demonstrated in ongoing clinical trials is remarkable. The in vitro transcribed mRNA induces immune responses due to its recognition by human endosomal and cytoplasmic RNA sensors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Therefore, the assessment of immunogenicity of mRNA therapeutics is pivotal for their possible use in humans.

Immunohistochemistry is a robust technique used to visualize the expression and localization of intra- and extra-cellular proteins. Although conventional histological sectioning offers high resolution images of immunostained proteins, sectioning 3-dimensional tissues results in poor preservation of tissue architecture. In sections, complete cellular structures and a complete understanding of the 3-dimentional distribution of proteins are not readily appreciated. In contrast, whole-mount preparations provide large volume 3D information, including intact cellular structures and the spatial relationships of cells and molecules in a complex tissue. However, adapting immunohistochemistry for use with intact tissues often results in poor permeability of antibodies, resulting in incomplete labeling, and a high degree of non-specific background.

Adhesion is a dynamic process, changing on a time scale of seconds (Fletcher, 1977; Vadillo-Rodríguez et al., 2004), therefore continuous, kinetic measurements are needed to study these events. Sampling a large surface area is also helpful, as adhesion tends to be heterogeneous and stochastic at a microscopic scale. In addition to having an assay that can make kinetic measurements, it is desirable to have an assay that is simple, cost-effective, and high throughput because it makes it possible to have multiple replicates and to test a wide range of experimental parameters.

Bio-protocol-1289	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3842	Analysis of B Cell Migration by Intravital Microscopy	B cells, Migration, Rolling, Extravasation, Intravital microscopy, Lymph node Background The secondary LN play a fundamental role in immune responses at different locations in the body as they are tactically localized to drain antigens via the lymphatic system. This implies in situ, the recruitment of immune cells, antigen encountering, and the mounting of immune responses (Tan and Watanabe, 2010; Tavares et al., 2014). B cell recirculation through the LN begins with its capture and L-selectin-dependent rolling, along the high endothelial venules (HEV); subsequently, B cells firmly arrest through G -protein coupled receptors (GPCR)-mediated recognition of optimal concentrations of chemokines presented on the luminal surface of the HEV. B cell arrest critically depends on the acquisition of the high-affinity conformation of the integrins LFA-1, VLA-4 (Park et al., 2016). After arrest, B cells crawl to search for a proper site for extravasation into the parenchyma of the LN, where they can recognize antigens and mount an immune response (Pereira et al., 2010; Mesin et al., 2016). The release of B cells from the LN also requires chemokine gradient sensing and interaction with the endothelium of the lymphatic sinuses; however, their exit through the efferent lymph is still poorly understood (Park et al., 2016).

The IC also receives non-auditory inputs including those from somatosensory regions, suggesting multi-modal integration of auditory and nonauditory information (Gruters and Groh, 2012). Mice offer an important model for unraveling the cellular and circuit-level principles of the IC function owing to the broad array of genetic tools available (Ono et al., 2017; Goyer et al., 2019; Chen and Song, 2019; Hoyt et al., 2019; Wong and Borst, 2019; Silveira et al., 2020). However, most neural recording in the mouse IC has been performed in anesthetized or restrained preparations (Muniak et al., 2012; Ayala et al., 2016). As a result, relatively little is known about the activity of IC neurons when the animals are engaged in movement such as locomotion (Chen and Song, 2019; Yang et al., 2020). We devised a head-fixed mouse preparation in which neural recordings can be made from IC neurons while a mouse runs on a passive treadmill (Yang et al., 2020). This preparation allows investigation of IC neural activity in behaving mice, while maintaining precise stimulus control. In a similar way to other awake restrained preparations, this protocol would make it easier to combine multi-electrode recordings with pharmacological or optogenetic manipulation of activity, compared to neural recordings with chronically implanted electrodes. This preparation has potential to bring new insights into the functions of the IC by observing how IC circuits operate during behavior such as locomotion or performing an auditory task. Moreover, it should facilitate the investigation of how manipulations of IC circuits or inputs to the IC might influence behavior.
Bio-protocol-1292	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3839	A 3D Skin Melanoma Spheroid-Based Model to Assess Tumor-Immune Cell Interactions	Skin, Cancer, Melanoma, Spheroid, 3D, Hanging drop, Innate lymphoid cells, ILC2 Background Three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids are spherical self-assembled tumor cell aggregates, which resemble micrometastases and replicate many features of solid tumors. As in the non-proliferating regions of avascular solid tumors, tumor cells within the inner regions of spheroids usually demonstrate perturbed gene and protein expression, altered metabolism, cell cycle arrest and necrotic death (Sant and Johnston, 2017). However, most currently available techniques for generating 3D spheroids are time-consuming, difficult and expensive. A simple, fast and easy method for generating 3D spheroids is through the use of the hanging drop assay (Foty, 2011; Berens et al., 2015). Within the hanging drop, cells have no direct contact with substratum and due to gravity accumulate at the free liquid-air interface to form a single spheroid. In light of the increasingly recognized role of interactions between tumor and immune cells, pre-established spheroids can be co-cultured either directly or indirectly with different populations of immune cells, as shown in Figure 1.
Bio-protocol-1293	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3838	Treadmill Running of Mouse as a Model for Studying Influence of Maternal Exercise on	Maternal exercise, Pregnancy, Treadmill running, VO2max, Mice, Protocol Background Maternal exposure to adverse environmental stimuli leads to various physiological changes in the offspring (Hay et al., 2016; Walejko et al., 2019; Battarbee et al., 2020), including predisposition of offspring to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (Godfrey et al., 2017; Wesolowski et al., 2018). Physical exercise is highly accessible and a prominent therapeutic tool to combat diet-induced obesity in adults (Peres Valgas da Silva et al., 2019). Epidemiological studies robustly show the beneficial effects of maternal exercise in improving maternal health and neonatal outcomes (Hopkins and Cutfield, 2011; Nascimento et al., 2012; Moyer et al., 2016; da Silva et al., 2017; Rogozinska et al., 2017; Davenport et al., 2018a and 2018b; Ming et al., 2018; Beetham et al., 2019; Hoover and Louis, 2019; Pastorino et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). But surprisingly, the biological effects of maternal exercise on offspring health have only been sparsely examined in the context of maternal obesity and high fat diet intake (Laker et al., 2014; Stanford et al., 2015; Stanford et al., 2017; Musial et al., 2019; Uddin et al., 2019), as well as normal chow diet (Raipuria et al., 2015), the effects of maternal exercise of healthy mothers on fetal development remain largely unexplored. Mice is the most commonly used model for biomedical studies; to facilitate mechanistic exploration, an exercise protocol for pregnant mice which can be easily translated into exercise in pregnant women is needed.

Specifically, NAc is part of a structure that we call ventral striatum, which also comprises the olfactory tubercle. It is well known the role of NAc in the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which regulates motivational behavior and is responsible for emotional and contextual behaviors (Baik, 2013). NAc has already been implicated in psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression), drug addiction, obesity, and chronic pain, which show the relevance in studying the neurobiology of this brain structure (Nestler and Carlezon, 2006; Volkow et al., 2011; Volkow and Morales, 2015; Brandão et al., 2019; Serafini et al., 2020).

Aminoacyl-tRNAs (charged) bring amino acids to the ribosome for peptide elongation, and then the uncharged tRNAs are released. The charging state of tRNA is largely determined by the available resource (i.e., amino acids) and their consumption by the ribosome. To analyze the charging state of cellular tRNA, methods have been developed using acid-urea gels to separate the total RNA and to detect the tRNA of interest by Northern blot (Janssen et al., 2012; Bullwinkle and Ibba, 2016). Recently, we explored the relationship between tRNA charging states and survival of starving bacteria (Yin et al., 2019). The method used in that study and elaborated here, has optimized the RNA purification step to better capture the tRNA charging state in bacteria other than E . coli. It also utilizes a commercially available system to perform the analysis without using radioactive materials, which could be helpful for some research groups.

Bio-protocol-1302	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3829	A Quick Method for Screening Biocontrol Efficacy of Bacterial Isolates Against Bacterial Wilt Pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in Tomato	Bacterial wilt, Ralstonia solanacearum, Biocontrol agent, Biocontrol efficacy, Tomato Background Ralstonia solanacearum is a soil-borne bacterial phytopathogen causing bacterial wilt disease in more than 200 crop species representing 50 different families (Seleim et al., 2014), the majority from the family Solanaceae (Thera et al., 2010). It can thrive up to several years in the soil retaining the capability to infect upon arrival of a host (Coutinho and Wingfield, 2017). Its natural route of entry is through the roots and finally, it ends up colonizing in the xylem vessels causing blockage of water conduit due to secreted exopolysaccharides with a corresponding wilting symptom observed in the leaves (Genin and Denny, 2012; Peeters et al., 2013; Seleim et al., 2014). Despite having usual practices of disease control such as the use of resistant plant varieties, industrial pesticides (Yuliar   et al., 2015), the use of biocontrol agents is a much-preferred choice in the current scenario due to environment friendly nature of the biocontrol agents. Bacteria and bacteriophages have been reported as biocontrol agents against R. solanacearum, of which bacteria being the predominant (Yuliar et al., 2015). The assay for the potential to antagonize R. solanacearum under in vitro conditions is quite easy as standard methods like agar well diffusion (Balouiri et al., 2016), disc diffusion (Gupta et al., 2015) and spot-on lawn assay (Vijayakumar and Muriana, 2015) are available. To be considered as a biocontrol agent of practical use it must primarily have the ability to control the pathogen under in planta condition and it should not have any negative effect on other living beings. The ability of selfsustainability and neutral effect on other living beings is a subject of later consideration, the first and foremost being its ability to antagonize the pathogen under in planta condition (Wang et al., 2019). Conventional methods of bacterial biocontrol agent screening against R. solanacearum under in planta conditions such as seed bacterization (Siddiqui and Meon, 2009) and soil drenching (Van Elsas and Heijnen, 1990) have several limitations as they require viz. 1) large amount of inoculum, 2) prolonged maintenance of plants and 3) large space. In general, these demerits sum up these methods as time consuming and costly. To further advance the research on biocontrol bacteria against R. solanacearum, a quick screening method escaping the limitations of above-mentioned methods is required. Considering the entry of this pathogen through the roots, it was hypothesized that the application of biocontrol bacteria in the root would have the maximum chance to antagonize R. solanacearum thereby attenuating or eliminating its disease-causing capacity. The method described here is easy to perform and economically viable as it requires very less resource and time. The method is useful to screen biocontrol efficacy of several bacterial isolates simultaneously against R. solanacearum in a very limited space.

Over the past 15 years, many additional members of the Mimiviridae family have been isolated from various environments and several protocols have been published to purify the virions (La Scola et al., 2003; Byrne et al., 2009; Arslan et al., 2011; Philippe et al., 2013; Campos et al., 2014; Andrade et al., 2017). Different approaches were developed, mostly involving sucrose cushion (Campos et al., 2014; Andrade et al., 2017), or sucrose discontinuous gradients (Arslan et al., 2011). However, these protocols are not optimal since the density of the virus is higher than the maximum density of a sucrose solution angle1.36/c m^3 and 1.3g/c m^3 , respectively – ICTV 9th report, 2011), meaning the equilibrium cannot be reached. Thus, a long time or high speed centrifugation results in a viral pellet instead of a ring or both depending on the conditions used. We recently reported (Jeudy et al., 2019) an optimized version of our previously published protocol using a CsCl discontinuous gradient (Byrne et al., 2009). Here, we provide the detailed protocol for the purification of Mimiviridae particles.

Yet, there remain critical gaps in our understanding of cancer nanomedicine, largely because details of interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells remain unknown. Others and we have identified nanoparticle-immune cell interactions as critical variables affecting in vivo nanoparticle fate and retention in tumors (Sheen et al., 2014; Zanganeh et al., 2016; Korangath et al., 2020). Flow cytometry enables quantitative analytical sorting of mixed cell populations by combining light scattering with detection of a fluorescent signal from appropriately labeled cells. To track nanoparticle uptake in cells, the nanoparticles are often labeled with a fluorescent dye to enable detection. The presence of dyes or other ‘excipient’ molecules on nanoparticles can change nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in unintended and unrealized ways, and do not provide sufficient analyte for quantitative validation of nanoparticle concentration. Here we demonstrate the use of the magnetic property of unlabeled iron oxide nanoparticles (no fluorescence labeling) taken up by the cells, when administered intravenously. Our developed assay provides quantitative and cell-specific data of unaltered nanoparticle uptake following systemic (i.e., intravenous) delivery. Our assay exploits the directional response of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs) to high-gradient magnetic fields, which causes cells containing the MIONs to sediment near the magnet, whereas cells devoid of MIONs remain in supernatant. In this manner, cells are ‘pre-sorted’ by magnetic separation to differentiate between the two populations before flow cytometry analysis. Following sorting, cells can be analyzed further by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) or ferene-s assay (Hedayati et al., 2018) to validate concentration of the analyte (Fe) which is then related to intracellular nanoparticle content; and, by other gene- or protein-based array technologies to assess biological responses at the molecular level within cells (Figure 1).
Bio-protocol-1310	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3821	Cleavable Affinity Purification (Cl-AP): A One-step Procedure to Affinity Purify Protein	Drosophila melanogaster, Affinity purification, GFP-tag, Cell biology, Mitosis Background Many proteins elicit their cellular function as part of multi-protein complexes. In order to gain full understanding of the role of a protein complex, in vivo approaches such as perturbation of protein levels/activity or monitoring dynamic localization need to be combined with in vitro biochemical assays and functional reconstitution. This holistic approach is currently severely limited. In vitro studies generally use proteins that have been individually expressed and purified in non-autogenous systems such as bacteria and insect cells, where folding and post translational modifications crucial to function may be dissimilar to that found in the original cell. Conversely, purification of specific proteins or complexes from cells/tissues generally relies on either co-immuno-precipitation or purification of a tagged version of the protein of interest which has been introduced into cells, for example using haemagglutinin (HA), FLAG3 or tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagging. There are two main issues with these in vivo approaches: (i) the beads themselves bind to non-specific proteins leading to contamination problems, (ii) the strong antibody-antigen or tag-matrix interaction cannot be disrupted without disrupting the interactions between protein complex subunits. Modified protocols, in which the antibody-antigen interactions are disrupted using peptide competition or in which the tag is cleaved using proteases can potentially result in the purification of soluble, intact protein complex from cells. However, the former requires extensive knowledge of the antibody-antigen interface while both procedures are undertaken in non-physiological conditions and result in protein complex that requires further purification (separating the excess peptide or the protease respectively), complicating this type of approach.

Causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2019 (WHO, 2019), TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease. The hallmark of the immunopathogenesis of TB is the formation of structurally organized, multicellular clusters called granulomas (Gengenbacher and Kaufmann, 2012). These structures mainly consist of a core of infected and non-infected macrophages surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes. The hostile environment within granulomas pushes Mtb to enter a slow- or non-replicating dormant state likely associated with a latent form of the disease. Consequently, Mtb dormancy leads to increased tolerance to antibiotics targeting metabolic pathways active during mycobacterial replication.
Bio-protocol-1312	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3819	Total Triglyceride Quantification in Caenorhabditis elegans	Caenorhabditis elegans, Triglycerides, Fluorometry, Fat, Metabolism Background Excess calories are often stored in the form of triacylglycerol or glycogen (Cohen, 2018). Abnormal levels of triglycerides (TAGs) have been implicated in heart diseases, pancreatitis, and atherosclerosis in humans (Cameron et al., 1974; Lee et al., 2003; Walther and Farese, 2012; Onal et al., 2017). TAGs are packed into lipid droplets in the cytosol. Lipid droplets are present in eukaryotic cells and vary in size from 20 n m to 100~um (Stobart et al., 1986; Suzuki et al., 2011). Lipid droplets consist of a hydrophobic core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer on the outer side. These organelles undergo active biogenesis, maturation, and turnover. At the time of need, such as during caloric restriction or starvation, TAGs are hydrolyzed to generate energy (Walther and Farese, 2012). Like other eukaryotes, C. elegans also stores excess energy in the form of TAGs packed into lipid droplets (Ashrafi, 2007; Mak, 2012). The droplets are present predominantly in the intestine and hypodermis  and  can  be  easily  visualized  by  staining  with  Sudan  black,  Oil-Red-O,  BODIPY ( E×/ E m=493/503) , or Nile Red (Kimura et al., 1997; Ashrafi et al., 2003; O’Rourke et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2010; Dixit et al., 2020). However, these techniques do not provide an estimate of the absolute amounts of triglycerides. Here, we describe a biochemical method for the quantification of absolute levels of triglycerides in C. elegans, with sensitivity in picomolar concentration. In this assay, lipases hydrolyze TAGs to release free fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol is further oxidized to generate a product that reacts with a probe to generate fluorescence at Ex/Em of 535/587. Outline of the protocol is shown in Figure 1. Biochemical quantification is useful for the detection of the glycerol moiety of the TAG, but it does not provide information on the fatty acid composition of stored fats in terms of saturated and desaturated fatty acids. This method can be utilized to study changes in total triglyceride content due to genetic pertubations, change in diet or pharmacological perturbations.

Cultivars Using Mature Embryo	Wheat, Triticum aestivum, Transformation, Agrobacterium, Mature embryo Background Genetic transformation is the most important technique used in wheat molecular genetics and improvement through genetic engineering. Microparticle bombardment and Agrobacteriummediated transformation are the two most widely used methods for genetic transformation in wheat (Vasil et al., 1992; Ding et al., 2009). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a simple, low cost and highly efficient method compared to the direct gene delivery method. Hexaploid wheat possesses a large genome and shows a low rate of regeneration and transformation (Bhalla, 2006). Well-defined tissue culture procedures are needed for callus induction and regeneration for successful genetic engineering in crop plants. Immature embryos, mature embryos, and mature seedlings are used as explant sources. Among these, the most common source of explants is immature embryos due to their high transformation and regeneration efficiency. However, the wheat immature embryos are not readily available throughout the year, and there is a small window where the development stage of the immature embryo can be used for tissue culture (Alikina et al., 2016). When mature embryos are used as explants, they can be collected in large quantities and stored or used immediately. In this study, we used mature embryos from Montana wheat cultivars in order to optimize the protocol for the regeneration of callus and transformation using Agrobacterium-mediated methods.

Microarrays are used to genotype individuals at a large number of known SNP locations and each SNP is tested for association with the phenotype of interest. But this approach requires prior sequencing of a reference genome and determining the locations of the SNPs. Moreover, this precludes mapping associations to structural variations such as insertion-deletions (indels) and copy number variations, and to variations outside of the reference genome.

Due to the selfdriven motion of individual bacterium propelled by flagella, high density bacteria suspensions would fall into a non-equilibrium state and emerge collective structures such as vortices, jets (Mendelson et al., 1999) or turbulences (Wensink et al., 2012) in a scale far larger than the size of an individual bacterium. As one of the most widely used model system for the study of bacteria collection motions (Copeland and Weibel, 2009), bacteria swarming refers to coordinated migrations of cells across wet solid agar surfaces with swirling patterns (Kearns, 2010). During swarming, motile cells are immersed in a thin layer of highly viscous fluid called “swarm fluid” (Wu and Berg, 2012). Physically, the interplay between the fluid medium and the stirring flagella provides the dynamic origins of the collective motion though far-field hydrodynamic interactions (Koch and Subramanian, 2011). Biologically, the fluid environment enhances the mixing and diffusion of oxygen, nutrition as well as the signaling molecules involved in Quorum sensing (Hardman et al., 1998) and chemotaxis (Taktikos et al., 2012). Although the swarm fluid is important for the generation of large-scale synergetic patterns, how it works and its relationships with fast moving cells remain unclear especially at the microscopic scale.
Bio-protocol-1320	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3811	In vitro Glutamylation Inhibition of Ubiquitin Modification and Phosphoribosyl-Ubiquitin Ligation Mediated by Legionella pneumophila Effectors	SidJ, SdeA, Glutamylation, PR-Ubiquitination, Legionella, Pseudokinase, ADP-ribosylation Background Legionella pneumophila is an infectious bacterium that opportunistically infects alveolar macrophages. This occurs through the inhalation of contaminated water aerosols, causing a potentially lethal form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease (McDade et al., 1977). Legionella infects host cells by the secretion of over 300 effector proteins that are used to hijack many host cellular processes and prevent their lysosomal degradation (Hubber and Roy, 2010). One process hijacked by Legionella is the ubiquitination system (Hubber et al., 2013). Ubiquitination is a eukaryotic posttranslational modification, that regulates a variety of cellular processes (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998; Chen and Sun, 2009; Hurley and Stenmark, 2011; Haglund and Dikic, 2012). This requires a concerted effort of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes to carefully regulate which proteins are ubiquitinated (Scheffner et al., 1995). However, Legionella have co-opted this modification with the SidE family of phosphoribosyl-ubiquitin ligases that act independently of E1 and E2 enzymes. This family uses two catalytic domains to ADPribosylate ubiquitin using the mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain, and then, ligates ADPRUb to a host protein serine residues using a phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain (Bhogaraju et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016; Kotewicz et al., 2017). These previously mentioned studies include means for assaying SidE  activity. The  SidE  family  includes  a  member,  SdeA,  which  has  been  identified  to  be spatiotemporally regulated by SidJ (Havey and Roy, 2015; Jeong et al., 2015; Urbanus et al., 2016); although, the mechanism of this regulation was not completely understood. It was suggested that SidJ may act as a PR-deubiquitinase (Qiu et al., 2017) when using Legionella purified SidJ (Qiu and Luo, 2019); however, recent studies do not recapitulate these results (Bhogaraju et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2020).

In the last decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the classical approach to measure transcriptional dynamics across the genome (Stark et al., 2019). Bulk RNA-seq on tissues does not allow to investigate transcriptional networks of different cell populations, specifically those of rare cell types. Thus, RNA-seq protocols that deliver high quality transcriptomes of low input samples are required.

PLISH is distinct from other existing spatial transcriptomic technologies because it combines high performance, rapid multiplexing, low cost, and technical simplicity (Wilbrey-Clark et al., 2020). PLISH results can be analyzed by automated calculation of single cell expression profiles in intact cryo- or paraffin-embedded tissue and it is compatible with concurrent immunostaining.
Bio-protocol-1324	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3807	Generation of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) Using Polyacrylamide Gels	Giant unilamellar vesicle, GUV, Liposome, Polyacrylamide, Gel-assisted swelling Background While gentle hydration and electroformation are two of the most commonly used methods for giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) formation, there are only a few studies that report their use for charged lipid types and in buffers of physiological ionic strength (Stein et al., 2017; Lefrançois et al., 2018). In 2009, Horger and colleagues described a simple gel-assisted swelling method for GUV generation that utilized a hybrid film of agarose gel and lipids. Unlike many other techniques, this method is capable of producing GUVs in buffers of physiological ionic strength and with charged lipid types (Horger et al., 2009). However, it was later determined that the agarose was incorporated into the GUVs, thereby affecting their mechanical properties (Lira et al., 2014). While other methods using poly(vinyl alcohol) (Weinberger et al., 2013) or dextran(ethylene glycol) (López Mora et al., 2014) have successfully developed GUVs without the incorporation of the gel into the vesicle membrane, they have not been widely utilized; this is likely due to the relatively uncommon reagents required. In our recent report (Parigoris et al., 2020), we describe another facile gel-assisted swelling method using soft polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. This technique can generate GUVs composed of both neutral and charged lipids, and under conditions of physiological ionic strength.

Bio-protocol-1325	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3806	Super-resolution Imaging of the T cell Central Supramolecular Signaling Cluster Using Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy	Immune Synapse, cSMAC, STED, LAT, T cell activation Background T cell activation in response to antigen presenting cells (APCs) is controlled by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) in combination with co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors and orchestrated by the integrated function of multiple signaling intermediates. Dynamic recruitment of signaling intermediates into microscopically detectable structures at T cell interface is an important element of signal integration. µm scale signaling assemblies were first described at the center and periphery of T cells activated by antigen presenting cells (APC) for the TCR, PKCθ and LFA-1, talin, respectively, as central and peripheral supramolecular activation clusters (cSMAC and pSMAC) (Monks et al., 1997 and 1998; Grakoui et al., 1999). µm scale of assemblies, in particular in the form of supramolecular protein complexes, provides unique biophysical and signaling properties (Li et al., 2012; Banani et al., 2016; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017). Such complexes are readily observed by fluorescence microscopy, held together by a network of multivalent protein interactions and often have distinct phase properties (Li et al., 2012; Banani et al., 2016; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017). The cSMAC has many properties of such supramolecular protein complexes: It contains various multivalent signaling intermediates (Balagopalan et al., 2015), prominently LAT (linker for activation of T cells), components of this complex including LAT and PKCθ exchange with the remainder of the cell to a moderate extent and slowly (Roybal et al., 2015), and components of this complex can be assembled into supramolecular structures in vitro (Su et al., 2016). Therefore, understanding biophysical properties of the cSMAC is of substantial importance.

There are many different kits and protocols out there from various companies and labs that attempt to meet this need. However, methods that are built specifically for one type of fungi may not be usable for another, and kit platforms can often fall short by way of being too broad in their application. Here we describe a cell culture, harvest, and RNA extraction method for the pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans, that utilizes a combination of techniques to give both high yield and highquality RNA in a consistent and efficient manner.

We used this protocol to quantify GSH and AsA contents in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exposed to heat (50~^°C) . As described for Arabidopsis thaliana, heat stress resulted in a decline in the content of both antioxidants and triggered cell death by ferroptosis (Distéfano et al., 2017; Aguilera et al., 2019 preprint). Although this protocol was set for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, it can be applied to determine GSH and AsA contents in other cyanobacteria. In cyanobacteria AsA contents are very low, uM range in normal conditions and pM under some treatments. For that reason we propose this senstitive method with an improved cell lysate procedure.

RNA-seq in particular, through its unprecedented range and sensitivity, allows investigation of otherwise intractable questions in gene regulation (Lister et al., 2008; Mortazavi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Advanced applications of RNA-seq include expanding the sample size for study across time or tissue, allowing gene regulatory network inference (de Luis Balaguer et al., 2017), and refining understanding of precision responses in a finer scale, such as in single- or few-cell transcriptomics experiments (Efroni and Birnbaum, 2016). The range of biological questions that can be addressed by RNA-seq, and its use, have risen dramatically since its introduction (Hrdlickova et al., 2017). However, many factors have limited its use more broadly, particularly in non-specialist labs.
Bio-protocol-1333	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3798	Estimation of the Minimum Number of Replication Origins Per Chromosome in any Organism	DNA replication, Replication origins, Replication rate, S-phase duration, Chromosome size Background For all living organisms, DNA replication is a key and highly regulated process of paramount importance for biological inheritance. The first step of DNA replication is the establishment of the genomic loci, where DNA synthesis begins. These loci are called replication origins (or just origins) (Méchali, 2010). In general, the beginning of DNA synthesis occurs after an initiator binds to an origin and recruits specific proteins that will result in the formation of the replisome in a process called origin firing. Each origin fired generates two replication forks that move in opposite directions. Replication forks synthesize DNA at a velocity (rate) that varies according to the organism and cell lineage (Myllykallio et al., 2000; Stanojcic et al., 2016; da Silva et al., 2017). The time needed for all chromosomes to replicate determines the S-phase duration, which seems to be robust for certain cell types and organisms (Zhang et al., 2017; da Silva et al., 2020).

There are over 70 Rab GTPases in mammals that have distinct localizations and functions in membrane trafficking. Further compounding complexity, while most Rab GTPases are ubiquitous, some display tissue specificity expression (van der Sluijs et al., 1992; McCaffrey et al., 2001; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014). Among them, the small GTPase Rab4, localized in the early endosome, regulates the trafficking along the endocytic route, from early and recycling endosomes, toward the plasma membrane. Rab4 has been involved in the recycling of receptors such as Tfn and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), integrins, ubiquitin ligases, as well as other machinery regulators associated with vesicle formation, budding, transport, and fusion (McCaffrey et al., 2001; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Stenmark, 2009; Parachoniak et al., 2011; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zaoui et al., 2019a). We recently reported strict requirement of the MT plus-end tracking proteins CLIP-170 for Rab4-mediated Met RTK recycling at the plasma membrane in response to its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The increased localization of Met/Rab4 vesicles towards the MT plus-ends in response to HGF results in enhanced cell protrusion dynamic and

Myelin  sheaths  accelerate  axonal  conduction  velocities  through  the concentration of voltage-dependent sodium channels at the small unmyelinated gaps between sheaths –the nodes of Ranvier (Huxley and Stampfli, 1949; Rushton, 1951; Waxman, 1997). Although oligodendrocytes are located throughout the CNS, not all axons are myelinated suggesting that the formation and size of myelin sheaths may precisely permit the fine-tuning of action potential speeds and neuronal synchronisation (Pajevic et al., 2014). Understanding what influences the amount of myelin generated by oligodendrocytes (i.e., the number and size of sheaths formed by one cell) is therefore important for understanding how myelin alters neuronal function.
Bio-protocol-1340	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3791	Analyzing (Re)Capping of mRNA Using Transcript Specific 5 End Sequencing	5′ Cap, Cap end mapping, mRNA, Primer ligation, PCR Background The N7-methylguanosine cap is a distinguishing feature of all eukaryotic mRNAs. Proteins binding to the cap function all stages of the mRNA lifecycle, including nuclear processing, export, translation and mRNA decay. The 5^ cap is added co-transcriptionally to all mRNAs, and a number of genome wide techniques (e.g., Capped Analysis of Gene Expression, or CAGE) (Morioka et al., 2020) have been developed that use the identification of capped ends as a way to mark transcription initiation sites. In addition to marking transcription start sites approximately 25% of CAGE tags map downstream within spliced introns (Djebali et al., 2012). Evidence of the biochemical basis for this came from our lab’s identification in 2009 of a cytoplasmic complex capable of restoring the N7- methylguanosine cap onto transcripts with a 5^. -monophosphate end, but not onto transcripts with a 5^. - hydroxyl end (Otsuka et al., 2009). Cytoplasmic capping is catalyzed by a complex of enzymes including capping enzyme (RNGTT), cap methyltransferase (RNMT) and its activating subunit (RAM), and a kinase that converts the 5^ -monophosphate ends of decapped transcripts to a 5′-diphosphate substrate for GMP addition (Trotman and Schoenberg, 2019). Our early work was based on use of a dominant negative form of capping enzyme that blocks cytoplasmic capping at the GMP addition step. Expression of this protein resulted in the appearance of a number of uncapped transcripts whose ends were mapped using 5' -RACE to the vicinity of downstream CAGE tags (Kiss et al., 2015; Berger et al., 2019). While encouraging, this approach has three major drawbacks; a) it requires separation of capped and uncapped RNAs, b) it assumes uncapped transcripts remain sufficiently stable to be detected, and c) it assumes uncapped ends detected in this manner have undergone limited additional exonucleolytic trimming.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus strain (a positive sense single stranded RNA virus)–severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has high infectivity (Atkinson and Petersen, 2020). The remains and wastes of COVID-19 patients can be a potential source of the virus exposure to the healthcare professionals, hence should be handled with adequate precaution. It is important as the health care system has to ensure that the dead body of a COVID-19 patient should not become a source of the infection, and demanding because of the varied religious beliefs and cultural practices that are associated with the way of disposing the dead body around the globe. In order to enable efficient handling of the remains and wastes of COVID-19 patients by the healthcare professionals, a stepwise protocol of standard operative procedures (SOPs) is essential. The emphasis should be on making the SOPs comprehensive enough for easy interpretation and application.

They offer a great opportunity not only for disease modeling, but for the development of therapeutic strategies for pathologies that involve tissue degeneration. Furthermore, the iPSCs promise relies on a safe replenishable cell source derived in chemically defined media and free of random DNA integration.

Lewis et al. (2011) found that quercetin, but not kaempferol, is an inhibitor of root basipetal auxin transport. In addition, flavonols also function as an efficient antioxidant for plants and humans as well. A prior study investigated that DPBA can fluoresce when it interacts with flavonols (Sheahan and Rechnitz, 1992). Based on this, DPBA has been widely applied to detect the flavonols accumulation in the plants (Nguyen et al., 2013, 2015 and 2016; Vu et al., 2015). Here, a detailed protocol for DPBA-based detection of flavonols is described. Apart from Arabidopsis, this protocol can be also used for other plants such as Brassica napus L. (Vu et al., 2015). Since other plant species may have a thicker and larger tissue than Arabidopsis, a vacuum can be applied to facilitate the penetration of DPBA into the plant tissues.
Bio-protocol-1351	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3780	Analysis of Gram-negative Bacteria Peptidoglycan by Ultra-performance Liquid Chromatography	UPLC, Cell Wall, Peptidoglycan, Muropeptide, Muramidase, Crosslink Background Bacteria are surrounded by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall that, in addition to a structural role, conveys cell shape and protects bacteria from external damage, acting as a barrier against biological, chemical and physical stresses. The murein sacculus or PG is the major component of the cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria present a monolayer in the periplasmic space (Gan et al., 2008), while it constitutes a thick mesh work with several pilled and crosslinked layers in Gram-positive bacteria, (Pasquina-Lemonche et al., 2020). The cell wall is a three-dimensional meshwork of crosslinked glycan strands that encloses the cell body (Glauner et al., 1988; Typas et al., 2011; Egan et al., 2020). The canonical monomeric subunit consists of the disaccharide pentapeptide GlcNAc-(β1-4)-MurNAc-L-AlaD-Glu-(γ)-(di-amino acid)-D-Ala-D-Ala, where meso-diaminopimelic acid and L-lysine are the most prevalent di-amino acids (Glauner et al., 1988; Vollmer et al., 2008). These monomers are converted into linear polymers by means of MurNAc-(β1-4)-GlcNAc glycosidic bonds and can be crosslinked by peptide chains.

Each intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) arising from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) renew this epithelium every 4-5 days (Crosnier et al., 2006). ISCs are located at the bottom of the crypts and express specific markers as previously reported by various papers (Muñoz et al., 2012; Clevers, 2013). Studies suggested that malfunctions of proper renewals of stem cells are related to intestinal disorders, and understandings of ISCs dynamic may elucidate the pathogenesis of various disorders including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (Okamoto et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-1357	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3774	TetR Regulated in vivo Repression Technology to Identify Conditional Gene Silencing in Genetically Engineerable Bacteria Using Vibrio cholerae Murine Infections as Model System	Gene expression, Resolution, Mouse, Repression, Screen, Regulation Background Facultative bacterial pathogens constantly need to adapt to varying conditions during environmental passages and host colonization. Optimal survival fitness is assured by transient activation and repression of numerous genes. Unravelling these adaptation processes is key to understand bacterial physiology and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention strategies. Diverse techniques have been established to study gene expression profiles in bacteria, including microarrays, RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR (Eisen and Brown, 1999; Bookout and Mangelsdorf, 2003; Wang et al., 2009). Such methods have to deal with the consequences of averaging heterogeneity in the bacterial population and only reflect transcription level at the time-point of harvest. Any unique patterns of gene expression related to specific regions in a subpopulation or transient regulation might be lost. Moreover, the requirement of relatively high quantity of RNA and purity restricts the above-mentioned technologies. In contrast, the TRIVET reporter system allows the detection of transient gene silencing events even in a subset of a complex, heterogenous bacterial population. TRIVET is a robust technique due to an irreversible change in the antibiotic resistance profile on a single cell level. On the contrary, TRIVET requires substantial, labor-intensive genetic engineering of the model organism and is therefore limited to bacteria with available genome sequence and tools for genetic modification.

During infection, Legionella utilizes an arsenal of over 300 effector proteins, many having unusual, unidentified biochemical functions that act to hijack host cellular functions (Hubber and Roy, 2010). One process co-opted by Legionella is the ubiquitination system. Studies have demonstrated that the SidE family of proteins can perform phosphoribosyl ubiquitination of substrate proteins independent of E1 and E2 enzymes (Bhogaraju et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016; Kotewicz et al., 2017). Some studies have implicated the importance of SidJ in the regulation of the SidE family of proteins, but the mechanism of regulation was not identified (Havey and Roy, 2015; Jeong et al., 2015; Urbanus et al., 2016). It was previously suggested that SidJ may act as a phosphoribosyl deubiquitinase (Qiu et al., 2017) using Legionella purified SidJ (Qiu and Luo, 2019); however, recent studies do not replicate these results (Bhogaraju et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2020). Our group (Sulpizio et al., 2019), and others (Bhogaraju et al., 2019; Black et al., 2019; Gan et al., 2019), have recently demonstrated that SidJ can polyglutamylate the SidE family member SdeA. For verification of this activity, it was important to recapitulate these findings in an in vitro reaction.

Bio-protocol-1363	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3768	Assembly and Imaging Set up of PIE-Scope	PIE-scope, Cryo-lamella, Cryo-CLEM, Correlative microscopy, Cryo-light microscopy Background Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is currently the principal method for investigating the structure of proteins and protein complexes directly in their native environment (Beck and Baumeister, 2016). Cells are generally too thick to be imaged using cryo-ET and, to overcome the issue of cell thickness, the most common and successful approach is to use a cryo-focused ion beam microscope (FIB) to thin the sample and produce flat electron-transparent lamellae of approximately 300 nm thick (Marko et al., 2006 and 2007). It is important to note that cells feature an extremely crowded and complex environment; therefore, the lamellae must be prepared targeting regions containing the event or structure under study. The approach that is generally taken is based on correlative microscopy (CLEM), where fluorescence microscopy is used to identify the location of a region of interest and then, through image correlation the same region is found using the FIB (Sartori et al., 2007; Arnold et al., 2016). The complete cryo-CLEM workflow links light microscopy (live cell imaging and cryo-LM), cryoFIB and cryo-ET. The workflow generally starts with imaging living cells or tissue in order to obtain information about the process dynamics. When appropriate, the sample is vitrified through plunge or high-pressure freezing. From this moment onwards, every time the sample is transferred inside or outside a microscope the chances for contamination and damage increase.
Bio-protocol-1364	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3767	Site-specific Labeling of B Cell Receptor and Soluble Immunoglobulin	B lymphocytes, BCR, Conformational changes, Site-specific labeling Background B lymphocytes are responsible for the production of protective antibodies against pathology arising from the recognition of antigens by the cell membrane expressed B cell receptors (BCRs). BCR complex comprises a membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) and a non-covalently linked heterodimer of Igα and l g . The mIg is composed of two surrogate light chains and two immunoglobulin heavy chains. The mIg heavy chain contains the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular domain. At the N-terminal domain of extracellular mIg, there are two variable antigenbinding motifs, following which are the constant domains (Reth, 1992). In terms of the heavy chain of IgM-BCR, it includes 4 domains, Cu1 , Cu2 , Cu3 , and Cu4 (Figure 1). Structurally variable domains in the heavy and light chain polypeptides form an antigen-binding site unique to the antibody. For example, VRC01 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) target the CD4-binding site (CD4BS) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120), neutralize over 90% of circulating HIV-1 isolates (Wu et al., 2010). BCRs expressing variable domains of VRC01 would recognize the gp120 and regulate B cell activation. In the BCR complex, disulfide-linked l g a/l g are the signaling subunits, contain immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) in their intracellular domains. Antigen binding to BCR induces ITAM phosphorylation by tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn followed by subsequent recruitments and phosphorylation of the second kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), resulting in the onset of several downstream signal transduction pathways altering gene expression to potentiate the

Acetylation has emerged as one of the major posttranslational  protein  modifications.  Accumulating  evidences  indicate  that  acetylation  rivals phosphorylation as a regulatory modification in mitochondria (Henriksen et al., 2012). Over 60% of mitochondrial proteins are acetylated, being of notice, which were involved in energy metabolism such as tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism (Hirschey et al., 2010; Hebert et al., 2013). Acetylation is also considered to be one of the main adaptive mechanisms for mitochondria in sensing nutritional challenges. Under the condition of excess energy supplement, mitochondrial proteins are hyperacetylated. Insufficient energy availability leads to a decreased acetylation level of mitochondrial proteins (Schwer et al., 2009). A large number of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes are acetylated in diabetes, including the FAO enzymes LCAD and beta-HAD (Kosanam, 2014). Dharendra et al. indicated that the upregulation of acetylation status of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes promoted fatty acid oxidation in the heart of high fat diet mice (Thapa et al., 2018). Our previous study also found that the acetylation levels of FAO enzymes LCAD and  -HAD were enhanced in HK-2 cells treated with palmitic acid (PA) (Lv et al., 2019). Protein lysine acetylation refers to covalent addition of acetyl group to lysine residue (N-lysine acetylation). At present, since there are no acetylated antibodies of LCAD and HAD, the detection of LCAD and HAD acetylation levels mainly depends on immunoprecipitation analysis which mainly concentrates the acetylated proteins by using acetyl-lysine antibody and then detects the content of acetylated LCAD and acetylated HAD by using LCAD antibody and HAD antibody respectively (Figure 1).

Bio-protocol-1368	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3763	Surgical Induction of Endometriosis in Female Mice	Endometriosis, Female, Mouse, Model, Surgery, Syngeneic Background Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological condition defined by the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, mainly in pelvic and abdominal surfaces (Zondervan et al., 2018). It affects 10% of women in reproductive age and it is associated with pain, infertility and reduced quality of life (Fourquet et al., 2011; Márki et al., 2017; Zondervan et al., 2018). Available pharmacological and surgical therapies for endometriosis have undesired effects and fail providing long-term alleviation of the symptoms (Falcone and Flyckt, 2018). Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed, and their development relies on the establishment of animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiological and behavioral features of clinical endometriosis.

On its way to forming the insoluble aggregates found in LBs, monomeric α-syn adopts a  -sheet-rich, amyloid-like conformation, leading to progressive fibrillation and concomitant insolubility (Iwai et al., 1995). Multiple lines of research describe a compelling correlation between post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-syn and its oligomeric state. Phosphorylation at Ser 129, for example, is prevalent on aggregated α-syn found within LBs (Chen and Feany, 2005). Tyrosine nitrations of α-syn have been linked to formation of stable oligomers and reduced fibril formation (Yamin et al., 2003), while O-GlcNAcylation of threonine residues reduces α-syn aggregation (Levine et al., 2019). Recently, we described a novel α-syn modification– adenylylation or AMPylation–which reduces α-syn fibrillation in vitro (Sanyal et al., 2019). Moreover, AMPylated  α-syn  displayed  diminished  disease-linked  phenotypes,  such  as  membrane permeabilization (Ysselstein et al., 2017; Sanyal et al., 2019).

Because general animal models in life science research, such as mice and monkeys, do not exhibit vocal learning, songbirds offer a great opportunity to study neural substrates of vocal learning, an essential element of human speech acquisition (Doupe and Kuhl, 1999; Bolhuis et al., 2010). Moreover, birdsong learning critically depends on a basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit that is discrete and specialized for this single task. This circuitry contrasts sharply with homologous mammalian circuits. Thus, songbirds are considered a tractable model system for studying neural mechanisms underlying basal ganglia-dependent motor skill learning (Doupe et al., 2005).

Blood not only provides for a minimally-invasive, cost effective and readily accessible source of immunological sample, but whole blood stimulation also serves as the closest mimic of the in vivo condition. Single-cell Mass Cytometry (or Cytometry by Time of Flight mass spectrometry, CyTOF) is ideally suited to broad profiling of the immune system, since it allows for >40 parameter panels, with little to no spillover between channels, which is a significant advancement over the procedural limitations of fluorescence flow cytometry (Leipold et al., 2015). Conversely, cell acquisition speed is significantly lower, and cell loss significantly higher, for CyTOF compared to fluorescence flow cytometry. In this report, we show the establishment of a reference panel of 39-anti human antibodies for mass cytometry that broadly identifies the major immune cell types, well established T and B cell subpopulations, activation markers, cytolytic markers and cytokines. To characterize these immune cell lineages and their functional states, the panel of anti-human heavy metal-conjugated monoclonal antibodies was selected to target the epitopes shown in Table 3, and to be compatible with fixed whole blood samples (Fernandez and Maecker, 2015 and our unpublished data). The panel described here, comprises an almost equal number of pre-made and in-house conjugates. To build this panel, we implemented the recommended panel design guidelines for mass cytometry. Low-abundance targets were allocated to higher-sensitivity channels and antibodies were designated to channels to minimize potential spectral overlap (Takahashi et al., 2017). All antibodies in the designed panel were then titrated to best discriminate the positive population from the negative. This panel can be further customized for specific hypothesis driven studies. In addition, by integrating barcoding (Behbehani et al., 2014) within this framework, we also demonstrate the compatibility of this panel with large clinical studies, to minimize technical variability. The ability to freeze fixed blood samples is also convenient for assembly of sample sets for retrospective batched analysis, with decreased biosafety risks in the setting of infectious disease. With regard to SARS-CoV2 or other infectious agents that might be present, whole blood fixation by the method described here has not been proven to be fully inactivating. But given the known effects of fixation on viral infectivity (Möller et al., 2015), it provides an increased level of safety.

Polysomes can be separated from the other ribosomal forms and unbound mRNA using polysome profiling. Polysome profiling has been a key technique in the field of protein translation. In conjunction with mRNA-seq, polysome profiling allows for transcripts that are regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms to be detected and quantified (Lan et al., 2019; Rollins et al., 2019) by quantitative PCR (Panda et al., 2017). Polysome profiling has also been used as a readout for global translation rates by quantifying RNA associated with polysomes under different conditions (Merret et al., 2015; Chassé et al., 2017). Additionally, polysome profiling has been used to isolate proteins that comprise polysomes and have allowed their contents to be probed using techniques like western blotting (Tiedje et al., 2012; Jin and Xiao, 2018).

Bio-protocol-1393	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3738	Quantitative Kinetic Analyses of Histone Turnover Using Imaging and Flow Cytometry	Chromatin dynamics, Histone, Cell cycle, Imaging, Flow Cytometry Background Chromatin remodeling is part of the numerous fundamental cellular activities in eukaryotic cells (Geiman and Robertson, 2002; Clapier and Cairns, 2009). Accessibility by transcription factors and RNA polymerases are generally associated with changes in DNA methylation and chromatin states, including accessibility, post-translational histone modifications and deposition of histone variants. Histone variants differentially coordinate the gene expression that regulates development, cell differentiation or other physiological activities (Banaszynski et al., 2010). They also play diverse roles in DNA repair, telomere maintenance, heterochromatin formation and chromatin segregation (Henikoff and Smith, 2015; Zink and Hake, 2016). Moreover, dysregulation of a histone variant’s incorporation is associated with cancer (Vardabasso et al., 2014), indicating a significant role in human disease. To understand the kinetics of histone variants, including incorporation into and dissociation from specific chromatin regions during the cell cycle, is crucial since it tightly links regulatory properties with the mitotic maintenance of epigenetic (heritability from parent to daughter cells). DNA replication involves major chromatin remodeling to duplicate the entire chromatin structure following mitosis. Histones that associate with chromatin prior to DNA replication are transiently dissociated from DNA by the access of the DNA polymerase complex. Release of pre-existing histones randomly re-associate at newly synthesizing replication forks together with newly synthesized histones (Balhorn et al., 1975; Alabert and Groth, 2012; Annunziato, 2012). Pre-existing post-translational modifications on histones and some histone variants also re-associate on the newly synthesized DNA at the replication fork, explaining reassociation of pre-existing histone at the replication fork is one part of the maintenance of mitotic inheritance of chromatin states. To determine the timing of post-translational modifications or incorporation of histone variants, a sensitive pulse-chase system that can distinguish the detection of newly incorporated histone from pre-existing histones is required. Newly synthesized canonical histones are unmodified when they are incorporated into chromatin during DNA replication. Unlike de novo DNA methylation, which occurs together with DNA replication (Tillo et al., 2016), most histone marks are not established on newly incorporated histones on the replicating fork. Proteomic based pulse-chase approaches (see in Alternative methods section below) have been used to determine the global kinetics of histone post-translational modifications by detecting the pre-existing and new deposition of histone acetylation and methylation at lysine residues (Pesavento et al., 2008; Scharf et al., 2009; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; Zee et al., 2012; Alabert et al., 2015). This approach identified two distinctive kinetic patterns of histone modifications. One group, such as histone H3 acetyllysine at 27 (H3 K27 ac), exhibits rapid turnover to equalize, and notably they are not maintained through the cell cycle (Scharf et al., 2009). This rapid acetylation kinetics probably represent temporally active transcription dynamics (Stasevich et al., 2014). While another group including H3 lysine tri-methylation at 9 (K9me3) or H3 K27me3 is acquired more slowly and step-wise from mono and di to tri-methylation, established during G1 phase following the cell cycle instead of before mitosis (Pesavento et al., 2008; Scharf et al., 2009; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; Zee et al., 2012; Alabert et al., 2015). Importantly, this group has the property of mitotic chromosome memory. The potential mechanism of maintenance of histone marks over cell division has been addressed by imaging approaches. In situ proximity ligation assays using specific antibodies against histone lysine methylations and their methyltransferases detected that histone modifiers continuously associate with the replicating DNA component in Drosophila embryos, suggesting the association of modifiers on replicating DNA may provide a “tag” to be methylated (Petruk et al., 2012).

As a consequence, correct use of accurate compute methods that provide estimates of the energy of binding between a potential drug molecule, and a protein is central to the drug discovery process (Cournia et al., 2017). The idea is that the ligand should preferentially bind to the protein and inhibit its function. In this protocol, you will learn how to calculate relative protein-ligand binding free energies using open-source free energy tools and the Biomolecular Reaction and Interaction Dynamics Global Environment (BRIDGE) platform (Senapathi et al., 2019) that is built on the Galaxy platform (Afgan et al., 2018). The free energy differences between two ligands are calculated through an in silico perturbation from one ligand to another as they are i) bound to a protein (e.g., T4 lysozyme) and ii) solvated in water. Setting up free energy molecular simulations to run on High-Performance Computing (HPC) hardware resources, often done using scripts and the Linux command line, is challenging and a barrier to obtaining reliable results. In addition to the computational challenges, not all steps are repeatable as when run using varied software and hardware resources available through different laboratories, universities, public facilities, and cloud platforms. However, the objective of BRIDGE development is to provide a web-based platform that includes reliable methods for simulation, analysis, and analytics. A similar approach to BRIDGE is employed by the BioExcel Building Blocks software (Andrio et al., 2019). The BRIDGE-Galaxy platform makes the transition from genetics to proteomics to chemistry a seamless one and enables repeatable computer simulations and analysis using curated workflows.
Bio-protocol-1401	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3730	Candida albicans Agar Invasion Assays	Hyphae, Pseudohyphae, Morphological switch, Invasive growth, Candida albicans Background Candida albicans is a multimorphic fungal pathogen that can grow by forming buds (small spherical cells), pseudohyphal cells (chains of elongated cells), or hyphal cells (long filamentous chains of cells with parallel walls) (Figure 1) (Noble et al., 2017). A wide range of environmental stimuli encountered in the host have been shown to promote the switch to invasive growth, including human body temperature (37 ^°C) , alkaline pH, C O_2 , factors in serum, and the sugar GlcNAc (N-acetyl glucosamine) (Kornitzer, 2019). Budding cells are thought to facilitate bloodstream dissemination and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (Pierce and Kumamoto, 2012; Witchley et al., 2019). In contrast, the filamentous pseudohyphal and hyphal forms of C. albicans are better able to promote invasive growth into tissues (Noble et al., 2017). For example, our recent studies have shown a key role for invasive growth in establishing oral C. albicans infections (Naseem et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1404	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3727	Determination of the Cellular Ion Concentration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Using ICP-AES	Ion content, Metal, ICP-AES, Yeast, S. cerevisiae Background Yeast has been extensively used to study the ionic response after gene deletion, modification of the extracellular environment, or heterologous protein production for example. In this context, having methods to monitor the ionic status of yeast cells is of high interest. ICP-AES uses high-energy plasma from an inert gas like argon to burn analytes very rapidly. The color that is emitted from the analyte is indicative of the elements present, and the intensity of the spectral signal is indicative of the concentration of these elements. Compared with other techniques (for example spectrophotometric methods, atomic absorption spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry), ICP-AES is a multi-ion analysis method involving simple and fast procedure with relatively low detection limits (Dahlquist and Knoll, 1978). The method described here applies to concentration determination of B a^2+ ,  C a^2+ , Cd^2+ , Co^2+ , Cu^2+ , F e^2+ , K^+ ,  M g^2+ , Mn^2+ , N a^+ , N i^2+ , and Zn^2+ , with the possibility of measurement of numerous cellular ionic concentrations from one 100 ml yeast culture (Eide et al., 2005; Thines et al., 2018). While this protocol has been tested in our laboratory for these twelve ions, this protocol could most likely be transferred to other elements. Besides, although described here for whole-cell measurement of the yeast ionic content, this method could be transferred to other cell types or to isolated organelles by fractionation on sucrose gradient for instance.

One of these proteins is FUS (Fused in Sarcoma), a nuclear protein mislocalizes in the cytoplasm of neurons in ALS/FTD patients, where it undergoes liquid-liquid phase transition followed by aberrant phase transition to form insoluble aggregates (Altmeyer et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015) (Figure 1). Karyopherin- 2 (Kapβ2), a nuclear import receptor (NIR), has been established as a chaperone and disaggregase of proteins with PYnuclear localization sequences (NLS), such as FUS (Guo et al., 2018; Hofweber et al., 2018; Yoshizawa, et al., 2018). The following protocol was developed to test the ability of Kapβ2 to inhibit and reverse FUS aggregation and phase separation ex vivo (Guo et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-1407	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3724	Real-time in vivo Imaging of LPS-induced Local Inflammation and Drug Deposition in NF-κB	Inflammation, NF-κB, In vivo, Mouse model, Bioimaging, Therapy Background An excessive TLR response causes localized and sometimes disproportionate inflammation, as observed in different types of wound and biomaterial infections. These wound complications delay proper healing and increase the risk of severe infections and sepsis. Considering the latter, several experimental models of sepsis and endotoxin shock have been developed which study the development of systemic inflammation (Lewis et al., 2016). There is however a need for models that address localized inflammatory events from a mechanistic and therapeutic perspective. Activation of the transcription factor NF- K B is a key component of various inflammatory conditions, and hence, NF-κB is considered an important therapeutic target (Liu et al., 2017). Real-time, longitudinal in vivo imaging of NF- K B activation in NFκB-RE-Luc reporter mice is an important tool in studies on inflammatory disease and efficacy of drug treatments. NFκB-RE-Luc reporter mice carry a transgene containing NFκBresponsive elements from the CMVα promoter placed upstream of a basal SV40 promoter, and a modified firefly luciferase cDNA (Carlsen et al., 2002). This reporter element can be induced by LPS and TNF- f a (Carlsen et al., 2002), and provides an excellent in vivo tool to monitor transcriptional responses of NF-κB. To achieve visualization of gene expression, luciferin, a substrate for luciferase, is administrated intraperitoneally to mice which in turn generate luminescent signals. Thereafter, in vivo imaging using IVIS spectrum is used for acquisition and analysis of the recorded signals.

Bio-protocol-1426	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3705	The ATPase Activity of Escherichia coli Expressed AAA+-ATPase Protein	GCN4, ATPase, AAA+-ATPase, MESG, Spectrophotometer Background Adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of ATP into ADP and free inorganic phosphate (Pi). This breakdown and release of Pi generates energy used by enzymes to carry out the chemical reactions that require energy. This process is an integral part of all the kingdom of life. ABC transporters are the transmembrane proteins that move solute through the membrane by ATPase activity (Rees et al., 2009). Some ATPases are cytoplasmic or membrane-associated proteins. AAA+ proteins are the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities such as protein degradation, membrane fusion, disassembly of protein complexes, microtubule dynamics, etc. (Snider et al., 2008). We identified GENERAL CONTROL NON-REPRESSIBLE-4 (GCN4), an AAA+-ATPase, as a novel player in regulating stomatal aperture and thus playing a role in plant innate immunity and drought tolerance (Kaundal et al., 2017). Here we describe the method to prove its ATPase activity. The GCN4 as an ATPase enzyme converts ATP to ADP and Pi, and then the enzyme phosphoribosyl phosphorylase (PNP) converts the MESG substrate into the final substrate. The assay monitors the spectrophotometric shift of the substrate (MESG) in the presence of Pi from 330 to 360n m . The conversion rate is directly correlated with the amount of Pi present in the solution and, that depends on the conversion of ATP to ADP by GCN4 ATPase activity. We reported the ATPase activity of a recombinant protein (GCN4-His) as absorbance (ABS) at 360 nm vs. protein concentration (Kaundal et al., 2017).

Many sources of DNA damage, either endogenous or exogenous, induce various DNA lesions including double strand breaks (DBSs), which activate the DNA damage response (DDR)–the cell process aimed at preserving DNA integrity. Two main repair pathways are involved in the DSBs repair: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (Mao et al., 2008). The HR process prevents the loss of genetic information upon DNA damage through a faithful repair using a complementary DNA sequence. By inhibiting the error prone NHEJ and triggering homology-directed DSB repair, DNA end resection has a crucial function in directing the repair pathway choice towards a faithful repair. So, to promote a correct HR, the DSBs are processed through the DNA end-resection machinery which is necessary to generate the long z^ single-strand

Bio-protocol-1432	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3699	Multiple Simultaneous Acute Stresses in Mice: Single or Repeated Induction	Acute stress, Chronic stress, Multimodal stress, Mouse, Restraint, Memory, Neuroscience Background Stress is common and inevitable. Severe or chronic stress can result in an array of cognitive, emotional, and physical problems. To understand the molecular, cellular, and physiological underpinnings of stress and its influence on brain function, stress must be modeled in the laboratory. It is conventionally accepted that chronic stress leads to adverse health outcomes while acute stress can be benign or advantageous. For example, chronic stress induced by unpredictable intermittent restraint impaired spatial memory (Peay et al., 2020), whereas one hour of acute restraint stress enhanced novel object recognition memory in male rats (Brivio et al., 2020). However, previous approaches to acute stress typically imposed a single or “simple” stress. Notably, acute stressful life events such as mass shootings or natural disasters may only last minutes to hours, yet consist of physical, emotional, and social stresses occurring at the same time. These events are now being shown to provoke negative long-term outcomes such as PTSD in a significant number of individuals (North et al., 1994; Lowe and Galea, 2017; Musazzi et al., 2017; Novotney, 2018). Therefore, there is an unmet need to model MAS in the laboratory to discover the mechanisms by which they promote negative outcomes.
Bio-protocol-1433	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3698	A Rigorous Quantitative Approach to Analyzing Phagocytosis Assays	Monocyte, Macrophage, Microglia, Phagocytosis, Quantification, Analysis, Microscopy Background Monocytic lineage cells (monocytes, macrophages, and microglia) survey tissue for pathological threats, and act as hubs of the innate immune system. They exercise innate immune functions in numerous ways: by secreting cytokines and chemokines, acting through complement signaling pathways, and phagocytosing pathogens and debris. The extent of macrophage activation can tip the balance of immune response within the body during health and disease. In diseases such as cancer, the activation of monocytic cells can result in either pro- or anti- tumoral responses, which trigger different disease outcomes. Similarly, monocytic cells modulate the progression and remission of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It is therefore critical to characterize these cells and their responses, to identify steps which may be exploited therapeutically.

The activation of macrophages is coupled to, and highly reliant on, specific reprograming of cellular metabolism (Tannahill et al., 2013; Galván-Peña and O’Neill, 2014; Jha et al., 2015; Kelly and O'Neill, 2015; Cordes et al., 2016; Mills and O'Neill 2016; et al.; Mills et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Lampropoulou et al., 2016; Van den Bossche et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2017). The metabolic reprogramming is wide-spread, involving changes in central metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid remodeling (Galván-Peña and O’Neill, 2014; O’Neill and Pearce, 2016; Van den Bossche et al., 2017). These changes in different pathways are interdependent, allowing cells to produce energy, signaling molecules (e.g., eiconsanoids), and effector molecules (e.g., nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species) for immune functions. Systematic profiling of metabolites and lipids is an important tool to further understand the role these biomolecules play in macrophages.

Cytological analysis to investigate localization and dynamics of meiotic proteins are crucial for understanding details of these processes. In many microscopic slide preparation methods, spatial chromatin organization is damaged by either mechanical processing or chemical solvents. Here, we describe a three-dimensional microscopy protocol to analyze chromatin structure and meiotic protein localization without disturbing nuclear organization.
Bio-protocol-1441	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3690	Calcein Release Assay to Measure Membrane Permeabilization by Recombinant	Alpha-synuclein, Calcein release, Liposome, Membrane permeability, Parkinson’s disease Background Liposomes are nanoscale lipid assemblies formed as a result of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions among lipid head groups and fatty acid side chains, respectively. These biological membrane-mimicking lipid bilayer assemblies are a useful tool for studying membrane interactions of protein biomolecules due to (i) the flexibility of modulating the diameter of the liposomes, and thus the membrane curvature; and (ii) control over the lipid composition (Ahmed et al., 2019; Siontorou et al., 2017). Due to their bilamellar structure, liposomes contain an intralumenal aqueous cavity within which water-soluble reagents can be encapsulated (Duzgunes et al., 2010). This property has been exploited in drug delivery approaches (Alavi et al., 2017) and in studies of membrane permeabilization (Gupta et al., 2013) and vesicle fusion (Duzgunes et al., 2010) involving the encapsulation of fluorescent, hydrophilic (membrane-impermeable) markers.
Bio-protocol-1442	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3689	In vitro Induction and Detection of Acrosomal Exocytosis in Human Spermatozoa	Acrosome, Acrosome reaction, Capacitation, Fertility, Infertility, Spermatozoa Background Unique to the male gamete, the acrosome is a lysosome-like membranous organelle that adorns the anterior region of the sperm head and is delineated by both inner and outer acrosomal membranes (Hermo et al., 2010a and 2010b). The acrosomal vesicle, so formed, encapsulates a myriad of structural and enzymatic components that are compartmentalized into either soluble or insoluble fractions (Guyonnet et al., 2012; Guyonnet et al., 2014). The latter of these, termed the acrosomal matrix, functions as a stable scaffold that allows for the controlled release of matrix associated proteins necessary for fertilization during the acrosome reaction (Guyonnet et al., 2014). This reaction is a distinctive exocytotic event that is initiated by the formation of multiple sites of fusion between the outer acrosomal membrane and the overlying plasma membrane. As this vesiculation process propagates across the anterior region of the sperm head, it destabilizes the acrosomal vesicle leading to the formation of hybrid membrane vesicles and the concomitant release of acrosomal contents (Barros et al., 1967). This, in turn, renders the fertilizing spermatozoon competent to penetrate the formidable outer vestments of the oocyte and access the underlying oocyte plasma membrane (Buffone et al., 2008).

Bio-protocol-1444	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3687	Intestinal Enteroid Culture for Human Astroviruses	Astrovirus, Enteric virus, Enteroid, Infection, VA, MLB, HAstV Background Human astroviruses (HAstV) are enteric viruses that are highly prevalent, causing widespread  infections  ranging  from  diarrhea  to  encephalitis.  Asymptomatic,  systemic  and extra-intestinal infections are common (Madeley and Cosgrove 1975; Bosch et al., 2014; Kolawole et al., 2019). Despite their medical importance, HAstV are some of the least characterized enteric viruses. Currently, three groups of human AstV are recognized: classic HAstV, and non-classic HAstV-MLB (Melbourne), and HAstV-VA/HMO (Virginia/Human-Mink-Ovine-like) with each group containing multiple strains. Several immortalized cell lines have been developed for successful propagation of multiple HAstV strains. Human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells are commonly used to propagate all eight serotypes of classic HAstV. As for the non-classic HAstV, Caco-2 cells, human embryonic kidney HEK293T, adeno-carcinomic human lung epithelial A549, and primary astrocytes were only recently described to support VA1 propagation (Janowski et al., 2017 and 2019). In addition, A549 and human liver Huh7 were developed to propagate MLB1 and MLB2 (Vu et al., 2019). However, no single culture system supports the replication of all tested species. The lack of a robust, physiologically relevant viral propagation system for genetically diverse viruses from all clades has created a fundamental gap in our understanding about the biology of HAstV. For example, little or no information is available on the in vivo cell tropism, pathophysiology, and host responses to HAstV infection.
Bio-protocol-1445	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3686	Isolation, Culture, and Differentiation of Primary Myoblasts Derived from Muscle Satellite Cells	Satellite Cell, Myoblast, Self-renewal, Differentiation, Skeletal Muscle, Pax7, MyoG Background Muscle homeostasis, maintained by diverse cellular functions, is vital for preserving muscle integrity. Tissue specific adult stem cells are capable of regenerating local tissues continuously throughout life. In adult skeletal muscles, a population of stem cells called muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) possess a robust regenerative capacity that is key for muscle homeostasis (Yin et al., 2013; Dumont et al., 2016). Quiescent MuSCs reside in a niche beneath the basal lamina juxtaposed to the muscle fiber and are responsible for growth and regeneration of muscle (Yin et al., 2013; Dumont et al., 2016). MuSCs are a heterogeneous population with diverse cellular and molecular profiles. Quiescent MuSCs, identified by the expression of Pax7, are activated and enter a proliferating stage in response to external stimuli such as growth factors, injury, or pathological conditions (Kuang et al., 2008). The proliferating myoblasts undergo several rounds of cell division and terminally differentiate into mononuclear myocytes, which fuse into myotubes to mediate muscle repair (Rudnicki et al., 2008). A dynamic balance between asymmetric and symmetric division is also important for determining the fate of myogenic cells in terms of self-renewal and expansion (Kuang et al., 2007).

These crystals have varied applications, such as cargo delivery (Ijiri et al., 2009) or x-ray structure determination (Baskaran and Ang, 2015). The properties of the crystals vary, but they are generally quite large relative to the cell, ranging from 12 um up to hundreds of mu m in size (Schönherr et al., 2015). In our recent work, we modified inka-PAK4 crystals to create ftn-PAK4, which is a ferritin-containing crystal that can mineralize enough iron to be attracted to a nearby permanent magnet (Li et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1449	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3682	A CRISPR Competition Assay to Identify Cancer Genetic Dependencies	Cancer, CRISPR, Genetic dependency, Cell fitness, Essential genes, Cell competition Background The CRISPR/Cas9 system is believed to have evolved as an adaptive prokaryotic viral defense (Mojica et al., 2005; Makarova et al., 2006). Soon after its discovery, it was co-opted by researchers and modified for laboratory use in genome editing (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; Hsu et al., 2014). By transgenically expressing the Cas9 nuclease along with a short guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to the target sequence, double-stranded breaks (DSBs) can be introduced at a locus of interest in a variety of cells and organisms (Cong et al., 2013). Mammalian cells typically repair these DSBs through the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in insertions or deletions (indels) at the targeted locus (Bothmer et al., 2017). These indels can disrupt coding sequences and result in the generation of null alleles.

Bio-protocol-1459	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3672	Gas Chromatography Detection Protocol of Short-chain Fatty Acids in Mice Feces	Short-chain fatty acids, Acidification, Extraction, Gas chromatography, Biological samples Background Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are important molecules that regulate and control biological functions (Siri-Tarino et al., 2015). SCFAs typically refer to volatile organic fatty acids with less than six carbon atoms (Wong et al., 2006; Marette and Jobin, 2015). They mainly include acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid. SCFAs are mainly produced by the intestinal microbiota, which ferments undigested carbohydrates and dietary fiber in the colon. (Henningsson et al., 2001). Many studies have shown that branched fatty acids are derived from branched-chain amino acids and leucine (Koh et al., 2016). A small amount of branched-chain fatty acids are generated by fermenting undigested proteins (Cummings and Englyst, 1987), such as isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid. Numerous types of SCFAs are present in the colon, and have different functions, because bacteria are complex and fermentation substrates vary in the colon (Topping and Clifton, 2001). These metabolites are formed and absorbed in the colon and then transported through the hepatic vein to the liver. Only approximately 5% of SCFAs are excreted in feces and the remaining are absorbed by colon cells (Ruppin et al., 1980; Hu et al., 2010; Stumpff, 2018). SCFAs play an important role in maintaining the normal function of the large intestine and the morphology and function of colonic epithelial cells. Among other features, SCFAs contributes to the main role of the intestinal flora in the homeostasis of the host. Studies have shown that propionic acid, butyric acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acid, which are signaling molecules, play important roles in activating G protein-coupled receptors and inhibiting histone deacetylase activity (Johnstone, 2002; Xiong et al., 2004). The most abundant molecules in SCFAs are acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which are usually present in deprotonated form. SCFAs are quickly absorbed by the hindgut and store energy. Acetic acid provides 10% of the body’s energy expenditure and is an important component of the collective energy source (Hu et al., 2010). The close relationship between SCFAs content in the human body and human health has always been the focus of research (O'Keefe, 2016). Therefore, a method for the rapid qualitative and quantitative analyses of SCFAs in complex biological matrices is needed to be developed (Fiorini et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-1466	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3665	Microscopy-based Methods for Rosetting Assay in Malaria Research	Malaria, Rosettes, Wet mount, Microscope, Live intracellular parasite staining Background Malaria remains a serious healthcare problem in many countries across the tropical and sub-tropical regions (World Health Organization, 2019). As the parasite matures within the host’s erythrocyte, substantial changes happen to the architecture of the infected erythrocyte, giving rise to altered cytoadherence of the infected erythrocytes, which is believed to be an important player in pathogenesis of severe malaria (Craig et al., 2012). One of the cytoadherence characteristics of infected erythrocyte is the rosetting phenomenon, where a late-stage parasite-infected erythrocyte stably adheres to at least an uninfected erythrocyte (Figure 1). Since its discovery in the late 1980s (David et al., 1988), various methods have been used to visualize rosettes. Most of these methods are microscopy-based, using wet mount prepared with malaria-infected blood samples. These include unstained wet mount (Udomsangpetch et al., 1992), Giemsa-stained wet mount (Chotivanich et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2013 and 2014), and fluorescent dye Acridine Orange-stained wet mount (Udomsangpetch et al., 1989; Treutiger et al., 1998; Ribacke et al., 2013). These methods were easy to use and can be conducted even in less-equipped laboratories. Here, we have provided protocols for the three methods, along with the steps of sample preparation for these techniques. When done properly, these methods can be used interchangeably according to the resources available in the work place.

Bio-protocol-1473	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3658	Quantification of Protein Kinase A (PKA) Activity by An in vitro Radioactive Assay Using the Mouse Sperm Derived Enzyme	Protein Kinase A (PKA), Capacitation, Sperm, Kinase activity assay, Fertilization Background Mammalian sperm are not able to fertilize an oocyte immediately after ejaculation. In order to acquire fertilization competence, they must undergo a series of cellular changes collectively known as capacitation (Stival et al., 2016). This process takes place within the female reproductive tract but can be emulated in the laboratory by incubating spermatozoa in a defined medium containing Ca^2+ , albumin and H C O_3^- , i.e., the “capacitation medium” (Visconti et al., 1995). Both H C O_3^- and Ca^2+ act synergistically on a soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), producing an elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. Among different targets, cAMP directly activates the Ser/Thr Protein Kinase A (PKA), which acts as a central player orchestrating capacitation signaling events (Buffone et al., 2014). Usually, two different approaches can be used to analyze its activity. One of them relies on western-blots, using commercially available antibodies that detect a consensus phosphorylation sequence of PKA (Krapf et al., 2010). However, the steady-state phosphorylation status of any protein depends on the relative activities of both kinases and phosphatases acting on it. Thus, this approach fails to directly analyze actual PKA activity. A second approach involves measuring in vitro PKA activity by direct quantification of ^32P incorporated into a peptidic substrate, in a controlled reaction mixture containing phosphatase inhibitors (Stival et al., 2018). This allows analysis of PKA independently of other factors that could modulate the phosphorylated state of the substrate. The chemical nature of the peptidic substrate named Kemptide, named after Dr Kemp, who first synthesized it in 1977 (Kemp et al., 1977), includes a phosphorylable serine residue and two arginine on positions -3 and -2, allowing high PKA specificity. In addition, the Kemptide possesses high relative positive charge which accounts for its strong binding to the negatively charged Whatman P81 cellulose paper, simplifying washing of excess radioactive material (Kemp et al., 1977). The enzyme PKA is composed by two regulatory and two catalytic subunits (Akamine et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2012). Both types of subunits can be found in Triton X-100-soluble and –insoluble fractions of mouse sperm (Visconti et al., 1997). The activity of PKA within the soluble fraction increases during sperm capacitation. However, the activity of PKA that remains in the insoluble fraction does not change during the course of capacitation, and thus, acts as an excellent source of PKA for enzymatic studies (Visconti et al., 1997).

Generally, HLA-I are found on all nucleated cells and bind to T cell receptors of C D8^+ T cells, whereas HLA-II are found on specialized immune cells called antigen presenting cells and bind to T cell receptors of C D4^+arT cells. The major receptors for HLA-I and HLA-II proteins are T cell receptors in conjunction with the co-receptors CD8 or CD4, although other receptors, proteins, and antibodies are known to functionally interact with both sets of molecules. HLA-I molecules comprise a highly polymorphic heavy chain, an invariant light chain (β2-microglbulin), and a short peptide. Solid phase bead arrays containing HLA molecules are widely used to screen patient sera for monitoring the presence of antibodies against specific HLA-I and HLA-II allotypes (Lachmann et al., 2013), as such antibodies mediate transplant rejection in organ and bone marrow transplantations. Solid phase bead arrays containing individual HLA-I (or HLA-II) proteins can also be used to identify HLA interactions with various receptors and assembly factors (for example, Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016 and Ilca et al., 2019). In Yarzabek et al. (2018), monoclonal antibodies against known epitopes on HLA-I heavy chains, called Bw4 or Bw6 epitopes (Müller et al., 1989; residues 77-83 of the HLA-I heavy chain) were bound to purified HLA-I-containing solid phase beads, with the goal of determining each antibody’s selectivity for Bw4 or Bw6 epitopes on individual HLA-I molecules. W6/32, a pan HLA-I antibody (Barnstable et al., 1978; Raghavan et al., 2019), was used to account for potential variations in HLA-I protein levels on the beads. Here we describe the detailed procedures for using HLA-I bead arrays to measure anti-Bw4 and anti-Bw6 selectivity and specificity for various HLA-I molecules, expanding on the protocols used in Yarzabek et al. (2018).

A variety of mechanisms regulate RNAPII activity to confer specificity to gene expression and facilitate biological processes. Among these is the direct post-translational modification of RNAPII itself in the form of phosphorylation (Mayfield et al., 2016), prolyl isomerization (Mayfield et al., 2015), methylation (Dias et al., 2015), and acetylation (Schroder et al., 2013). Some of the best-studied modifications are phosphorylations of the C-terminal domain of RNAPII’s largest subunit RPB1 (CTD). This domain is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and composed of a species-specific number of repeats of the consensus amino acid heptad YSPTSPS (conventionally numbered as Tyr1, Ser2, Pro3, Thr4, Ser5, Pro6, and Ser7). Phosphorylations of specific heptad residues act to recruit transcription factors and coincide with distinct stages of the transcription cycle. For instance, Ser5 phosphorylation hallmarks transcription initiation while Ser2 phosphorylation is apparent during the transition from promoter escape to productive elongation. These dynamic post-translational modifications and precisely recruited protein factors constitute the ‘CTD Code’ for eukaryotic transcription and ensure the production of mature and functional transcripts (Jeronimo et al., 2013; Mayfield et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-1489	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3642	Determination of Ureides Content in Plant Tissues	Allantoin, Allantoate, Ureides, Purine, Plants Background Determination of ureides is important for characterizing N_2 fixation and assimilation in legume plants as well as stress and nutritional responses of non-ureidic plants like Arabidopsis (Brychkova et al., 2008; Watanabe et al., 2014; Irani and Todd, 2016 and 2018). The formation of allantoate is also useful for in vivo and in vitro determination of allantoinase activity (Duran and Todd, 2012). Techniques requiring expensive equipment, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are commonly used for ureide quantification while ethanol extraction is mostly employed for ureide recovery from plant tissues. The present protocol is based on flexible spectrometry that uses low volume of cheap reagents. The use of phosphate buffer instead of ethanol for ureide extraction and quantification greatly improved the reproducibility of the measurements, possibly by decreasing the interfering compounds that abound with the ethanol extraction.
Bio-protocol-1490	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3641	FRET Reporter Assays for cAMP and Calcium in a 96-well Format Using Genetically Encoded Biosensors Expressed in Living Cells	FRET, cAMP, Ca^2+ , GPCR, High-throughput screening Background Live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays in combination with microscopy and digital imaging technologies are commonly used to monitor the kinetics with which levels of cAMP and Ca^2+ fluctuate in response to GPCR agonist stimulation. Here, we report an alternative approach that does not use microscopy but that instead enables FRET-based detection of cAMP and Ca^2+ in a 96-well format using an automated microspectrofluorimeter and monolayers or suspensions of living cells. The protocol uses genetically encoded biosensors so that averaged kinetic data for pharmacological studies can be obtained in real time using a microplate reader under conditions in which GPCR agonists are applied at known concentrations. These FRET assays use cell lines stably expressing the cAMP biosensor H188 (Klarenbeek et al., 2015) or the  C a^2+ biosensor YC3.60 (Nagai et al., 2004), both of which exhibit superior dynamic range in comparison to earlier FRET reporters. Our protocol describes how H188 or YC3.60 can be expressed stably with recombinant GPCRs so that precise dose-response analysis is achievable. This protocol builds on our published studies, whereby novel dual agonist and triagonist properties of synthetic GPCR agonist peptides (e.g., EP45 and GGP817) were discovered (Chepurny et al., 2018 and 2019).

The circadian clockwork consists of cell-autonomous and clock gene-driven negative feedback loops of transcription (Dunlap, 1999). In mammals, the transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the transcription of clock and clock-related genes such as Period (P e r) and Cryptochrome (C r y) via E-box elements. PER together with CRY, a potent transcriptional inhibitor, subsequently functions to negatively regulate this complex (Reppert and Weaver, 2002). The in vivo evaluation of individual intrinsic circadian characteristics in humans, either with a constant routine or forced desynchrony protocol, is expensive and labor-intensive. Therefore, evaluation using ex vivo culture assays to estimate in vivo circadian characteristics could present important advantages. For example, several studies have concluded that circadian characteristics in peripheral cells reflect individual circadian preferences, known as chronotype (Brown et al., 2005; Hida et al., 2013). For a simple and non-invasive evaluation of cell-autonomous circadian performance in humans, including intrinsic period length, we developed a method to monitor clock gene expression in real time using an ex vivo culture of hair follicles (Yamaguchi et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-1499	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3632	Barley Transformation by Particle Bombardment Using Callus	Barley, Particle bombardment, Immature embryo, Transformation Background Tissue culture based Agrobacterium transformation is commonly used for introducing vector DNAs into plant cells, but it is often genotype dependent. The availability of an efficient transformation protocol is thus crucial for the success of genome editing via Agrobacterium transformation. Barley is one of the economically important cereal crops, unfortunately, Agrobacterium transformation is in principle only working for the cultivar ’Golden Promise’. Developing alternative transformation methods is thus required to facilitate genetic improvement by genome editing of the crop. Particle bombardment can deliver vector DNAs into plant cells directly, which could be an alternative transformation method for barley. Here we report a particle bombardment protocol for barley transformation modified according to wheat particle bombardment using callus (Tian et al., 2019).

During this process excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens, are deposited and accumulate. If progressive, fibrosis becomes chronic, ultimately leading to organ failure and even death (Rockey et al., 2015). Several types of fibrotic diseases have been described in humans, many of which are of unknown etiology. The organs most commonly affected are the lungs, kidneys, liver, heart and skeletal muscle (Hinderer et al., 2019; Majo et al., 2019; Mahdy, 2019). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for instance, is a common, progressive and often fatal disease associated with scarring of the lung tissue that gradually looses the capacity to oxygenate, leading to the patient’s inability to breathe properly (Lederer et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-1503	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3628	Isolation of Tumor Cells Based on Their Distance from Blood Vessels	Blood vessels, Tumor angiogenesis, Spatial transcriptomics, Tumor heterogeneity, Hypoxia Background Tumor dependence on adequate blood supply has provided a rationale for antiangiogenic cancer therapy (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000; Vasudev et al., 2013). Traditionally attributed to provision of oxygen and other blood-borne substances, the roles of the tumor vasculature in tumor biology were recently extended to include perfusion-independent, paracrine inputs exerted by secreted endothelial-produced angiocrine factors (Butler et al., 2010; Beck et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2013), as well as via direct tumor-BV contacts mediated by reciprocal Notch signaling (Cao et al., 2014; Wieland et al., 2017). Because tumor neovascularization often fails to fully match increasing perfusion demands imposed by continual tumor growth, the relative distance of a tumor cell from the nearest perfused vessel is likely to greatly impact the nature and magnitude of vascular inputs operating through all indicated modes of tumor-BV communication. Correspondingly, differential exposures to vascular signals might facilitate emergence of certain tumor phenotypes and generate intra-tumor cell heterogeneity. To determine how vascular cells may impact tumor cells, tumor-endothelial cell (EC) co-cultures in both 2D and 3D configurations have been used (Khodarev et al., 2003; Timmins et al., 2004). However, because ex-vivo systems do not reveal perfusion-dependent effects and are also unable to recapitulate the complex interactions prevailing in the tumor microenvironment, in vivo approaches are clearly needed. The latter has thus far been limited to using EC-specific manipulations of selected candidate genes (Beck et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2014 and 2017). The need still existed for an integrative, high-throughput approach for unraveling the whole spectrum of genes, pathways and phenotypes affected by the vasculature and, moreover, a general approach to determine spatial ranges of vascular influences per each of these phenotypes.

Physical avoidance of pathogens is one of the various defense strategies used by the host (Medzhitov et al., 2012; Kavaliers et al., 2019; Singh and Aballay, 2020). Different sensory mechanisms, including chemosensation and elicitation of pain by nociceptor neurons upon detection of bacterial toxins, lead to avoidance behaviors. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms leading to pathogen avoidance holds the potential to uncover conserved host defense responses that are important against pathogen infections.
Bio-protocol-1509	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3622	Evaluation of the Efficiency of Genome Editing Tools by a Frameshift Fluorescence Protein	Insertion-deletion, In-del, Reporter, CRIPSR-Cas9, Genome editing, NHEJ Background Genome editing tools are very important for the investigations of biological mechanisms and prevention and/or treatment of genetic diseases (Maeder and Gersbach, 2016). In the last couple of decades, several genome editing tools have been introduced, which include the meganucleases (Epinat et al., 2003), zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Kim et al., 1996), transcription activator-like effectorbased nucleases (TALEN) (Christian et al., 2010), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated genes (Cas) (Jinek et al., 2012; Cong et al., 2013; Sander and Joung, 2014). In general, these tools create DNA double stranded breaks (DSB) to trigger genome editing in vivo (Maeder and Gersbach, 2016). The evaluation of the efficiencies and specificities of genome editing tool is essential for their applications and further developments. In our recent published study, we described a reporter that can generate quantitative readout for genome editing efficiency (Kumar et al., 2019). In this system, a 20 bp target sequence is placed in a multiple cloning site (MCS)

Bio-protocol-1529	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3602	Evaluation of B Cell Proliferation in vivo by EdU Incorporation Assay	EdU, Proliferation, Flow cytometry, B cell, Germinal center, Subepithelial dome Background Long-lived antibody producing cells, also known as plasmablasts or plasma cells (PCs) primarily originate from germinal centers (GCs), microanatomical sites that form within lymphoid organs following infection or immunization. Entry into the GC reaction involves affinity-based competition of B cells, each expressing an antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) with a given affinity and specificity towards the antigen. Upon antigen encounter, B cell activation takes place, which is accompanied by extensive clonal expansion through rapid proliferation. Peyer’s patches (PPs) are lymphoid organs located along the small intestine and are the main site where B cells class switch their immunoglobulins to IgA. The subepithelial dome (SED) is a small niche within the PP wherein immune cells, including B cells, interact with gut-derived antigens. During pre-GC events in PPs, B cells bearing high affinity BCRs do not show preferential advantage in colonization of the SED and formation of PCs, indicating that affinity-based competition does not take place at this site (Biram et al., 2019). Nonetheless, only high affinity clones progress into the GC structures and enter the germinal center reaction. Massive proliferation is a major aspect of the GC reaction in peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and PPs (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). During the GC response, B cells undergo iterative cycles of migration between the dark zone (DZ), where they proliferate and mutate their antibody-encoding genes and the light zone (LZ), where the high affinity varaiants are selected by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells for preferential expansion and differentiation into plasma cells. B cells in the GC rapidly divide, and the magnitude of this proliferation is proportional to the strength of T cell help (Gitlin, Shulman and Nussenzweig, 2014). Although B cell proliferation can be induced in vitro by LPS and anti-IgM stimulation, analysis of GC B cell proliferation in culture is currently not possible. In particular, analysis of B cell proliferation in specialized immunological niches such as the SED, can be only examined in vivo.

Moreover, these viruses have been described as potential virulence factors (Fichorova et al., 2013; El-Gayar et al., 2016; Rath et al., 2019). Of particular note, the presence of the endosymbiont Leishmania RNA virus (LRV), a Totiviridae double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, in Leishmania guyanensis (Lgy) exacerbates leishmaniasis disease (Ives et al., 2011; Rossi et al., 2017), favors metastasis by inducing interleukin17 (Hartley et al., 2016) and also increases the risk of treatment failure (Adaui et al., 2016; Bourreau et al., 2016; Vieira-Gonçalves et al., 2019). This shows the importance of viral dsRNA detection in parasites. The technique presented here is sequence-independent, in comparison to quantitative real-time PCR, so it can be applied widely to RNA viruses. This dsRNA detection protocol can also, and is recommended, to be used to confirm (or be confirmed with) other methods of detection that are sequence-independent or -dependent, as for example dot blot or PCR (Zangger et al., 2013). The technique is presented here with LRV, however its application is possible for other RNA viruses and in other parasites (Grybchuk et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-1536	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3595	Examining Cocaine Conditioning Place Preference in Mice	Mouse, Behavior, Cocaine, Reward, Conditioned place preference Background The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm has been used for decades to examine the role of genes, histone modifications, signaling pathways, and brain regions in drugassociated memory and reward (see Tzschentke, 1998; Malvaez et al., 2009). It incorporates classical conditioning to assess the rewarding effects of contextual cues that have been associated with a drug (for reviews see Schechter and Calcagnetti, 1993; Everitt et al., 1999; Bardo and Bevin, 2000). There are various CPP chamber designs and configurations, depending on the specific research question being addressed (Bardo and Bevin, 2000). However, the most commonly used designs are the twocompartment or three-compartment chambers. Both chambers types rely on the ability of mice to differentiate between two compartments that contain distinct olfactory, tactile, and visual cues. The three-compartment design contains an additional compartment, between the two larger compartments, that does not contain olfactory or tactile cues, and is used only for the entry and removal of mice at test. Here, we describe the equipment setup, key parameters, and data collection in the three-compartment CPP paradigm using adult mice. The focus of this protocol is on cocaine CPP. However, this paradigm can be used for other drugs of abuse (e.g., other psychostimulants, opioids, and nicotine).

Bio-protocol-1538	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3593	In vivo Quantification of Alkanes in Escherichia coli	ADO, Alkanes, Enzyme assay, Biochemistry, Biofuels, Gas chromatography Background Research on alkane production using engineered microbes has gained significant popularity as it provides an attractive alternative to reduce dependence on fossil fuels while mitigating the climate change effects (Lee et al., 2008; Knothe, 2010; Lu, 2010; Schirmer et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2011). Various pathways have been uncovered or artificially assembled for the production of alka(e)nes in microbes (Schirmer et al., 2010; Mendez-Perez et al., 2011; Rude et al., 2011; Akhtar et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2013; Rui et al., 2014). However the highest reported titres for alkane production so far have been in E. coli using the AAR-ADO pathway (Figure 1) (Fatma et al., 2018). AAR catalyzes the reduction of fatty acyl-ACP or fatty acyl-CoA into fatty aldehydes using NADPH which is subsequently converted into alkanes by ADO (Marsh et al., 2013). E. coli is the most widely used host for heterologous production of biofuel candidates due to a broader knowledge of its cellular metabolic network as compared to other hosts. Heterologous co-expression of cyanobacterial AAR and ADO in E. coli results in production and secretion of alkanes (Schirmer et al., 2010). However, quantification of alkanes by the ADO enzyme and determination of the in vivo efficacy of the ADO enzyme cannot be determined due to the variation in the substrate availability by the first enzyme AAR of the pathway. Reports on differences in the solubility of AAR and hence its activity (Kudo et al., 2016) indicate that using AAR as a source of substrate for measuring in vivo activity of ADO is not a suitable approach. Hence, we developed an in vivo enzyme assay, which involves addition of the substrate aldehyde exogenously to the medium that is taken up by the growing cells and gets converted to alkane by the heterologously expressed intracellular ADO enzyme, thus giving a more reliable and accurate measurement of its in vivo efficacy.
Bio-protocol-1539	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3592	Environmental Conditioning and Aerosol Infection of Mice	Influenza, Humidity, Environment, Mouse, Infection, Aerosol challenge Background Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are one of the major causes of seasonal respiratory infections in the world, resulting in half million deaths annually (Johnson et al., 2014). IAV outbreaks occur during the winter season in temperate regions, peaking between November and March in the Northern Hemisphere and between May and September in the Southern Hemisphere (Tamerius et al., 2013; Alonso et al., 2015). Virological research in guinea pigs shows that low temperature and humidity enables better aerosol transmission of influenza virus (Lowen et al., 2007). In addition, epidemiological studies demonstrate that a drop in absolute humidity correlates closely with the rise in influenza-related deaths in humans (Shaman et al., 2010). It is worth noting that in tropical and subtropical climate regions, which are wet and warm, the virus can thrive on surfaces of objects and cause fomite transmission (Shek and Lee, 2003, Moura et al., 2009).

Current degron methods include ZF1 (Armenti et al., 2014; Sallee et al., 2018), auxin-inducible degron (AID) (Zhang et al., 2015; Martinez et al., 2019), and GFP nanobody-mediated protein degradation (Wang et al., 2017). Originally, the auxin-based degron method was co-opted from plants and transplanted into nonplant systems such as yeast, chicken and mammalian cell culture (Nishimura et al., 2009). This method was recently optimized for use in C. elegans due to advances in CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology (Zhang et al., 2015; Dickinson and Goldstein, 2016). In the presence of the plant hormone auxin, C. elegans proteins tagged with an AID are rapidly degraded by a heterologously expressed plant-specific F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). TIR1 functions as a substrate-recognition component of the CUL-1-based SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex consisting of SKR-1/2, CUL-1 and the RING component RBX-1 (Martinez et al., 2019). In as little as 30 min, C. elegans proteins exposed to auxin can be precisely degraded in a tissue- and cell-specific manner (Zhang et al., 2015; Martinez et al., 2019).

The microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that induce such immune responses are often broadly conserved structural components of microbes, such as chitin from fungi and flagellin from bacteria (Cook et al., 2015). Recognition of MAMPs by extracellular plant receptors leads to MAMPtriggered immunity (MTI), which contributes to halt microbial invaders and maintain plant health (Böhm et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-1544	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3587	An in vitro Assay to Screen for Substrates of PKA Using Phospho-motif-specific Antibodies	Protein Kinase A (PKA), Kinase activity, In vitro, Western blot, Protein phosphorylation Background Hormones and other factors that cause activation of adenylate cyclase through G-linked G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and subsequently promote generation of second messenger cAMP can affect cellular processes like cell migration. Elevation of cAMP level leads to activation of PKA, a serine-threonine kinase that plays an important role in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in migrating cells. PKA influences different facets of actin cytoskeleton-regulatory processes including modulation activities of a) Rho-family GTPases (Rho, Rac and Cdc42), b) actin-binding proteins (e.g., VASP vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein), c) kinases which indirectly control the function of actinbinding proteins (e.g., p21-activated kinase) and d) myosin (Howe, 2004). PKA and other kinases, however, can also modulate other proteins by phosphorylation that are currently unknown.

Cell motility is a highly orchestrated event that can be summarized as a cycle of four basic steps: i) membrane protrusion driven by actin polymerization, ii) stabilization of protrusion through integrinmediated cell-matrix adhesion, iii) cell-body translocation driven by actomyosin contractile force, and finally, iv) rear release as a result of the mechanical action of contractile force and/or proteolysis of cellmatrix adhesion components (Sheetz et al., 1999; Ridley et al., 2003; Panetti et al., 2004; Stradal and Scita, 2006; Tomasevic et al., 2007; Le Clainche and Carlier, 2008). These processes involve dynamic remodeling of actin cytoskeleton which is dependent on de novo synthesis as well as regulation of important structural and regulatory components of actin cytoskeletal system.

The lipid bilayer structure of these exosomes can prevent the degradation of encapsulated biomolecules (such as miRNAs) from complex conditions (as in feces) (Koga et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2013). This protective function of exosomes is especially useful, as these protected contents can be used to diagnose the diseases, such as colitis and colonic cancer. Importantly, reengineered exosomes can also efficiently deliver therapeutic biomolecules to some specific disease targets without generating immune toxicity to the host (Sun et al., 2010; Johnsen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Kim and Kim, 2018).
Bio-protocol-1548	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3583	A Triple-challenge Mouse Model of Allergic Airway Disease, Primary Influenza Infection, and Secondary Bacterial Infection	Asthma, Allergic airway disease, Influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Co-infection Background The global prevalence of individuals with asthma is increasing, with 300 million presently suffering and an additional 100 million new incidences predicted by 2025 (Nunes et al., 2017). Because of the altered immune system, asthmatic individuals are believed to have an increased risk of susceptibility to influenza infection. Seasonal and pandemic influenza infection can result in concurrent bacterial infection which can lead to airway respiratory distress syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition (Gilca et al., 2011). Whether or not asthmatics are more susceptible and have reduced protective anti-influenza immune responses, is controversial. During the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic, asthmatics were more likely to be hospitalized due to influenza. However, clinical data also suggest that asthmatics were less likely to die or require ICU admission than those without asthma. The majority of deaths during influenza pandemics are not caused by the viral infection per se, but instead, are due to complications from secondary bacterial infections (Morens et al., 2008; MacIntyre et al., 2018). We previously reported that mice with AAD are resistant to a single infection with influenza virus or S. pneumoniae (Furuya et al., 2015; Sanfilippo et al., 2015). However, there was no murine model that addressed the influence of allergic airway disease (AAD) on immunity to influenza virus and bacterial co-infection. Thus, we have developed a triple challenge model in mice to test the hypothesis that asthmatics are protected from severe influenza because they are less likely to develop severe secondary bacterial pneumonia (Roberts et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1553	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3578	Spectrophotometric Assessment of Heme Oxygenase-1 Activity in Leishmania-infected	Heme oxygenase-1, Macrophage, Leishmania, Spectrophotometry, Bilirubin, Hemin Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the major host defense arsenals against invading pathogens used by macrophages (Missall et al., 2004). On the other hand, intra-macrophage pathogens neutralize early oxidative burst for their successful persistence within macrophages (Paiva and Bozza, 2014). In response to such oxidative stress, organisms can deploy antioxidant enzymes of host cells such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to scavenge ROS (Kathirvel et al., 2010). Intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani could effectively exploit host antioxidant enzyme HO-1 for ROS neutralization (Saha et al., 2019). HO-1 is a potent anti-oxidant enzyme catalysing the oxidative cleavage of heme to generate carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron (F e^2+) , and biliverdin (BV). The biliverdin is further acted upon by another enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR) to produce bilirubin (BL) (Tenhunen et al., 1969).There are several techniques to quantify the activity of HO-1 based on detection of one of its ultimate reaction product bilirubin via high-performance liquid chromatography (Lincoln et al., 1988; Ryter et al., 1999), visible spectrophotometry (Schacter, 1978; Tenhunen et al., 1969) and radiochemical methods (Sierra and Nutter, 1992). Detection of CO by gas chromatography (Vreman and Stevenson, 1988) has also been used to assay HO-1 activity, but because of its complexity and subsequent product analysis steps the protocol is not variedly applicable. Now, biliverdin is the primary metabolite of the heme degradation by HO-1. However, it has poor spectral properties with an extinction coefficient (ε) of 8 to 10 mM^-1 c m^-1 (Kutty and Maines, 1981). Thus, most common HO-1 activity assays rely on the reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin. Original spectrophotometric quantification of bilirubin for detection of HO-1 activity was outlined  by  Tenhunen  et  al.  (1969).  In  the  method,  bilirubin  formation  was  monitored spectrophotometrically by the increase in absorbance at 468n m ^Sigma_^E468=43.5Pi_^m M^-1c m^-1) , which is approximately 5-fold higher than that of biliverdin. Modifications of this main spectrophotometric assay for assessment of HO-1 activity was carried out and HO-1 activity was determined by monitoring bilirubin formation using the difference in absorbance at 464 to 530n m (E464-530=40mM^-1Lambdac m^-1) (Maines, 1996; Maines and Kappas, 1974).The current protocol (Figure 1) utilises the same principle but are performed with certain minor modifications to make it much more convenient.

Bio-protocol-1555	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3576	Isolation, Purification and Characterization of Exosomes from	Fibroblasts, Cell culture, Exosomes, Ultracentrifugation, Sucrose gradient, Western blot Background Exosomes are single-membrane, heterogeneous nanovesicles ranging in diameter from 30 to 150~n m , secreted by all cells and present in virtually all body fluids. The spectrum of soluble and membrane macromolecules, mRNAs, microRNAs present in exosomes depends on the metabolic status as well as the developmental origin of the cell(s) secreting these nanovesicles. Owing to their cargo composition, exosomes can initiate signaling pathways in the receiving cells and have been involved in development, immunity and in the maintenance of normal tissue physiology. In disease conditions, like neurodegeneration, fibrosis and cancer, they have been shown to trigger and propagate pathological stimuli (Rackov et al., 2018; Gurunathan et al., 2019; van de Vlekkert et al., 2019). Here we describe a protocol for the purification of exosomes from fibroblast cultures established from adult mouse gastrocnemius (GA) muscle (van de Vlekkert et al., 2019). These purified exosomal preparations can be subjected to mass spectrometry. The advantage of this method is that is scalable and cost effective. Primary mouse fibroblasts are kept in culture for no more than 4 passages to preserve their primary status, and their conditioned medium is then processed by differential centrifugation to obtain crude exosomal preparations that are further purified by sucrose density gradients. This protocol has been successfully used to assess and compare the protein composition of exosomes released by normal mouse fibroblasts and by activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) cultured from the GA muscle of WT and Neu L^-/- mice, respectively (van de Vlekkert et al., 2019). The Neu1–/– mouse is a model of the lysosomal storage disease sialidosis, caused by deficiency of the sialidase neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) (de Geest et al., 2002; d’Azzo et al., 2015). Mouse cells deficient for Neu1, including primary myofibroblasts, have excessive exocytosis of soluble lysosomal contents as well as increased release of exosomes (van de Vlekkert et al., 2019). Exosomes purified from Neu L^-/- myofibroblasts were shown to be potent carriers of fibrotic signaling molecules and to be responsible for eliciting a pathogenic cascade, which ultimately led to muscle fibrosis and degeneration (van de Vlekkert et al., 2019).

Additionally, these species are capable of modulating host immunity via flagella (Neville et al., 2013). The lack of genetic modification techniques for these organisms has prevented a more complete understanding of the complex interactions between these bacteria and their human host.

Loss of function homozygous, and compound heterozygous missense mutations in GBA1 are associated with the accumulation of glucosylceramide and the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher’s disease (Sidransky, 2012). Whereas heterozygous mutations in GBA1 are associated with increased risk of developing the neurodegenerative movement disorder Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Sidransky and Lopez, 2012). While GBA1 mutations occur in approximately 5-15% of PD cases (Neumann et al., 2009; Sidransky et al., 2009; Lesage et al., 2011), reduced GCase activity is also observed in PD patients without GBA1 mutations (Murphy et al., 2014; Alcalay et al., 2015; Atashrazm et al., 2018), and there is increasing evidence supporting the notion that restoring GCase function is a valid therapeutic option for PD (Schapira 2015; Sardi et al., 2018). Subsequently, a number of small molecule chaperones have been described that can restore GCase function (Khanna et al., 2010 and 2012; Patnaik et al., 2012; McNeill et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-1560	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3571	Determination of Flavin Potential in Proteins by Xanthine/Xanthine Oxidase Method	Flavin, Flavoprotein, Reduction potential, Xanthine oxidase, Midpoint potential Background Several biophysical methods can be used to measure the reduction midpoint potential (E_m) of flavins in a protein. These potentiometric methods usually rely on the electrochemical coupling between the protein of interest and an electrode. For example, in complex flavoproteins harboring additional cofactors such as iron-sulfur centers and quinones, electrochemical methods and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are often used to determine the E_m of the redox centers (Kowal et al., 1995; Saenger, et al., 2005; Hudson et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2015). However, in simple flavoproteins that contain only flavin redox centers, the co-factor can be directly studied by conventional optical spectrophotometry which does not require special electrochemistry equipment or expensive EPR instrumentation. In 1990 Vincent Massey introduced a simple method that allows determination of the flavin reduction potential from the equilibrium concentrations of the oxidized and reduced partners, i.e., flavoprotein and a reference dye (Massey, 1991). The method does not directly measure the reduction potential of the flavin but rather determines a difference between E_m values of the flavin and a reference dye. The scheme in Figure 1 describes the method. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase system provides a slow continuous reduction of the indicator dye and the flavin in the presence of benzyl viologen (BV) or methyl viologen (MV) which ensures the rapid equilibration of reducing equivalents. This allows slow changes in equilibrium of the reduced and oxidized forms of the protein and dye until both are completely reduced. A series of spectra recorded over the course of the reaction is used to calculate the ratio of the oxidized and reduced forms of flavin and dye. The Nernst plot of an equilibrium concentration, the dye against the flavoprotein allows determination of the shift in the E_m of the protein in comparison with the dye. Because some of the components used in this method are low potential chemicals and proteins (viologen, reference dyes, and many flavoproteins) that are readily oxidized by even trace amounts of oxygen, a requirement for this system is that strict anaerobiosis be maintained.

The ability of sarcomeres to produce muscle contractions relies on two myofibril components: thin filaments and thick filaments. Myosin thick filaments are anchored at the M-line, located at the center of the sarcomere, whereas actin thin filaments are anchored at the Z-discs, which border either side of the sarcomere. Z-discs are therefore essential to the maintenance of myofibril structure and contractility and their failure to form can result in drastic defective muscle phenotypes underlying various human myopathies (Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017).

Bio-protocol-1565	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3566	High-resolution and Deep Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Ancestral	Phylogenomics, OneKP, MMETSP, Plants, Phylogenetics, Evolution, Transcriptome Background Phylogenetic trees are fundamental to understanding the evolution of genes, gene families, species, phyla and even kingdoms. They help to depict the diversity and also resolve the differences at various levels. For example, at protein level, they help us to identify orthologous groups based on amino acid differences across various species. Earlier, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on few gene/protein sequences from limited numbers of species. With the ever-growing sequencing data, as more and more genomes and transcriptomes are becoming accessible, there is tremendous potential for e.g., discovery of new lineages, ‘gap-filling’ in phylogenies and hence, an improved understanding of biology (Levy and Myers, 2016; Burki et al., 2019).

Generally, rats can relay information through ultrasonic vocalizations and pheromones. Given their highly developed olfactory systems, a wide array of information may be conveyed through the sense of smell. Releasing and receiving pheromonal signals play critical roles in both neurobiological and ethological aspects of rodent behaviour. These include but are not limited to the selection of mating partners (Kumar et al., 2014), spreading alarm signals (Kiyokawa et al., 2013), novel food acquisition (Posadas-Andrews and Roper, 1983), territory marking (Brain et al., 2009), demonstrating social status (Krames et al., 1969), and maternal interaction (Bind et al., 2013). Pheromonal signaling can actually interfere with several biological functions in a laboratory setting; the presence of unfamiliar males can prevent pregnancy (Bruce, 1959), female estrous cycles may become prolonged when exposed to urine from a lactating female (Hoover and Drickamer, 1979), and male urine can cause acceleration of puberty in females (Vandenbergh, 1975). It has been known for some time that certain pheromones can carry information regarding sexual behaviours (Hayashi and Kimura, 1974; Gawienowski et al., 1975), but more recently it has been conclusively shown that mammals can also communicate information about stress via alarm pheromones (Inagaki et al., 2014; Kiyokawa, 2017).

Increase in antibody affinity is mediated through iterative cycles of somatic hyper mutation and affinity-based selection, a process which is orchestrated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Kepler and Perelson, 1993; Oprea and Perelson, 1997; Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). The GC is comprised of two microanatomical sites; the dark zone, where B cells proliferate and acquire somatic hypermutations, and the light zone, where B cells interact with cognate antigen and T cells. Although intravital imaging techniques were able to define immune cell dynamics in GCs (Allen et al., 2007; Hauser et al., 2007; Schwickert et al., 2007), transition between the GC zones remained in question. This problem was later solved by the generation of mice expressing photoactivatable GFP (PA-GFP) (Victora et al., 2010).

Bio-protocol-1571	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3560	Testing Bone Formation Induction by Calvarial Injection Assay in vivo	Osteoblast, Osteocyte, Bone formation, Cytokines, Growth factors Background Bone formation is a fundamental process required for the development of the skeleton, for the progression of skeletal growth and to maintain bone structure throughout life as the skeleton is constantly remodeled. Bone formation is a process that occurs by three steps: (1) deposition of collagenrich osteoid, (2) mineralization of that osteoid which occurs by deposition of bioapatite crystals around the collagen fibres, and (3) maturation of the mineralized bone substance (Blank and Sims, 2019). These three steps are mediated by two cell types derived from a common progenitor. Osteoblasts deposit osteoid and initiate mineralization, and as the osteoid is deposited, some osteoblasts become embedded within the bone matrix and differentiate into osteocytes (Dallas and Bonewald, 2010); these embedded cells also control the extent and nature of mineralization of bone (Vrahnas et al., 2019).

Each adult Drosophila compound eye is made up of roughly 800 single eye units called ommatidia. The ommatidia reside in the most distal portion of the visual system, called the retina. Each ommatidium is composed of 8 light-sensitive photoreceptors (R cells), with the motion-sensitive outer R1-R6 cells forming a stereotypical horseshoe shape around the color-sensitive inner R7 and R8 cells. The R7 cell body lies in the distal retina, directly above the more proximal R8 cell body. The R1-R6 cells are responsible for motion detection and express rhodopsin(Rh)-1 which detects light in a broad spectrum (Montell, 2012; Behnia and Desplan, 2015). R7 and R8 photoreceptors are responsible for color vision and express Rh3 or Rh4 and Rh5 or Rh6, respectively (Rister and Heisenberg, 2006; Morante and Desplan, 2008).

Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, containing salts, amino acids and vitamins, is one of the most commonly used plant growth medias (Murashige and Skoog, 1962). MS was originally developed for tobacco but has since been used to grow other plant species including Arabidopsis and maize. This growth media does not readily react with phytohormones unlike other soilless media such as peat, perlite and vermiculite (Best et al., 2014 and 2017; Malik et al., 2014). Therefore, hormones can be added to the growth media to compare responses between wild-type and mutant growth.
Bio-protocol-1577	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3554	Method for Measuring Mucociliary Clearance and Cilia-generated Flow in Mice by ex vivo	Cilia, Biophysics, Mucociliary clearance, Lung, Ex-vivo imaging Background The composition of diverse biophysical properties, each aiding a specified function, make up the human body. A key example of this is the generation of flow in many different organ systems, including the central nervous system (Olstad et al., 2019), reproductive tracts (Afzelius et al., 1978; Yuan et al., 2019) and the pulmonary system (Satir and Sleigh, 1990), made by specialized ciliated cells. Understanding how the environment or external stimuli affect these processes can give us insights into disease. In our recent study (Kudo et al., 2019), we explored how humidity affects influenza infections in a mouse model. By using this method of ex-vivo measurement of cilia-generated flow in mice, we were able to visually measure how ambient humidity altered the rate of virus clearance (Figures 1 and 2). Previous studies have used radiolabeled particles to measure mucociliary clearance using a noninvasive method (Hua et al., 2010; Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017). However, this requires the use of radioactive materials and SPECT or other machines to measure radioactivity that may not be readily available. Measurements like this can be made more accessible using ex vivo imaging of particles in tissue (Nance et al., 2012; Francis and Lo, 2013; Mastorakos et al., 2015 and 2016). Here, we describe a detailed method of measuring the flow generated by cilia in upper airway tissue, adapted from Francis and Lo (2013). Our method is easy to perform and allows for measurement of large numbers of mice at a relatively low cost. This protocol can also be performed in a short time, allowing for the preservation of biological differences and measurement in a large number of animals. Finally, it can be adopted for other organ systems or tissues, measuring various biophysical properties, as shown by Nance et al. (2012), in identifying what criteria drug loaded particles must meet to navigate through brain parenchyma. Altogether, this protocol will provide researchers with an easy to follow, step-by-step methodology to measure properties of biological tissues ex vivo (Figure 3).
Bio-protocol-1578	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3553	Using Seed Chipping to Genotype Maize Kernels	Zea mays, Maize, Seed chipping, Kernel chipping, Genotyping Background Maize is an agriculturally important crop that is grown throughout the world. It has many uses including human consumption, animal feed, and ethanol production (Ranum et al., 2014). Maize is also a useful model for investigating a wide range of biological questions including plant domestication, monocot growth and development, pest resistance, and genome evolution (Strable and Scanlon, 2009). Although maize has many scientific and industrial uses, it is a large plant that requires significant space in either a greenhouse or field to grow. In addition to the cost of maintaining a greenhouse or field, considerable effort is required to perform directed crosses and collect plant material for genotyping and other analyses. Due to these factors, the ability to genotype maize kernels prior to planting is valuable. This protocol describes the process of seed chipping, where a small piece of endosperm is removed with a razor blade to be used for DNA extraction and genotyping. This protocol is a modification of a method where kernels are soaked in water prior to chipping (Gao et al., 2008). We use fully dried maize kernels for chipping to prevent problems we encountered using pre-soaked kernels such as fungal contamination and unanticipated germination. This method is also useful when genotyping a large number of kernels, because the dry kernel chips do not have to be processed immediately for DNA extraction.

Polysaccharide and cell wall protein interactions provide structure to plant cells, while also actively playing important biological roles during growth and adaptation to diverse external conditions (Cosgrove, 2005 and 2016; Kesten et al., 2017). The plant cell wall acts as an important physical barrier during biotic or abiotic interactions, but can also provide an endogenous source of signaling molecules released during stress response (Cosgrove, 2005 and 2016; Kesten et al., 2017 and 2019). These cell wall-derived molecules can activate signaling cascades to alert the plant host of an invading pathogen or a need to redirect growth resources. Cell wall polysaccharides are also important for industrial uses–pectins are widely used in the food and cosmetics industries, while cellulose is important for the food, paper, and textile industries (Pettolino et al., 2012). As such, efficient and informative methods for characterizing plant cell wall polysaccharides are vital in both academia and industry to further understand the biological role of the plant cell wall and improve ease of polymer extraction while reducing waste during industrial applications.

Bio-protocol-1589	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3542	Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Activity Assay in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Superoxide dismutase, Yeast, Manganese, Sod2p, Nitroblue tetrazolium, Redox state Background SODs are defined as metal-containing antioxidant enzymes that reduce harmful free radicals of oxygen formed during normal aerobic metabolism to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. These enzymes are classified based on the metal required as cofactor for proper enzymatic activity: CuZnSODs, MnSODs, FeSODs, and NiSODs. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two SODs: the CuZn-Sod1p and the Mn-Sod2p (Abreu and Cabelli, 2010). This protocol focuses on the determination of the enzymatic activity of the Mn-Sod2p, found in the yeast mitochondrial matrix. In this protocol, activity of Sod2p is visualized through nitroblue tetrazolium staining. According to this method, the excitation of riboflavin by light, catalyzed by tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), generates superoxide radicals, which convert the yellow nitroblue tetrazolium into blue formazan. In the regions in which Sod2p is present, the superoxide radicals are rapidly removed and formazan formation is prevented. Sod2p is thereby revealed in clear bands on a blue background (Packer, 2002). The method described here includes inhibition of the CuZn-Sod1p by potassium cyanide and thereby enables to determine specifically for the enzymatic activity of the Mn-Sod2p. Apart from providing a method to quickly determine the enzymatic activity of Sod2p, this protocol can be used to correlate the activity of the mitochondrial Sod2p to the bioavailability of manganese cations required for proper activity, a decreased manganese content in the close vicinity of Sod2p resulting in a lower enzymatic activity (Thines et al., 2018). Besides, due to the implication of both Sod2p and manganese cations in resistance against oxidative stress, this protocol can be used to assess the redox state of yeast cells, a decreased enzymatic activity reflecting a reduced ability of the cell to neutralize free radicals.

Bio-protocol-1594	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3537	Cell-free Reconstitution of the Packaging of	TGN, Reconstitution, Budding, Cargo sorting, Vesicles, Secretion Background The trans Golgi network (TGN) is an essential transport hub in the secretory transport pathway. To ensure the fidelity of vesicular trafficking, eukaryotic cells employ a variety of protein sorting machineries to accurately package specific cargo proteins into transport vesicles at the TGN which are then delivered to specific destinations (Guo et al., 2014). To deepen our understanding of the specificity of the TGN sorting process, it is important to develop an assay that can faithfully reconstitute the vesicle formation and cargo sorting process at the TGN. This assay can be utilized to directly and quantitatively measure the roles of a specific factor in regulating the packaging of a specific cargo protein into transport vesicles. Cell-free reconstitution of the packaging of cargo proteins into COPII vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been well established (Kim et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Merte et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019;). An in vitro assay that reconstitutes the release of a specific cargo protein, TGN46, into transport vesicles at the TGN has been developed (Ponnambalam et al., 1996; Wakana et al., 2012). TGN46 is mainly localized at the TGN, although it can cycle between the TGN and the plasma membrane (Ponnambalam et al., 1996). Recently, we devised an alternative vesicle budding protocol to reconstitute the packaging of non-Golgi resident cargo proteins into vesicles at the TGN (Ma et al., 2018). We performed the vesicle formation assay by incubating cells at ^20^°C to accumulate newly synthesized cargo proteins at the TGN and performed the budding reaction in the presence of the GTPase defective mutant, Sar1A(H79G), to inhibit packaging of cargo proteins into Coat Protein Complex II (COPII) vesicles at the ER. Moreover, we utilized floatation to efficiently remove cytosolic proteins that are not associated with vesicles (Figure 1). Using this assay, we have reconstituted release of planar cell polarity proteins, Vangl2 and Frizzled6, from the TGN (Ma et al., 2018). Our assay indicates that the tyrosine sorting motif on Vangl2 and the polybasic sorting motif on

Multiple aspects of both the host and pathogen need to be considered to determine potential risk factors in the host and key virulence factors in the pathogen. Innate immunity represents the first line of defense against infections, triggering a cascade of responses, including inflammation, neutralization and recruitment of components of the adaptive immune system (Akira et al., 2006). Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the site of bacterial infection in response to chemoattractant gradients of host chemokines released from damaged cells as well as bacterial products themselves, where they initiate the immune response by phagocytosis and netolysis (Renshaw and Trede, 2012; Deng et al., 2013). Macrophage recruitment follows, with these cells focused on removing dead cells, remodeling injured tissue and coordinating adaptive immune cells (Weiss and Schaible, 2015).

It has been previously described to be applicable for plant cells in a study using tobacco BY-2 cell suspension cultures (Hanamata et al., 2013; Klionsky et al., 2016). Here we provide a detailed protocol for in planta quantification of autophagic flux in epidermal root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Figure 1). The TT assay employs ratiometric quantification of red and green fluorescence and allows to quantify relative induction or inhibition of autophagy. Another advantage of this method is that it provides valuable information on subcellular localization of ATG8, i.e., translocation of ATG8 from the nuclei to cytoplasm (Zhou et al., 2012), incorporation into puncta of different morphologies and motility, and its accumulation in the vacuole.

Bio-protocol-1598	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3533	Induction of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in Mice with Pilocarpine	Hippocampus, Seizures, Neurodegeneration, Epileptogenesis, Pilocarpine Background The mouse pilocarpine model of TLE is an experimental paradigm that has been widely used as an animal model of human mTLE. This model has been used for testing long-term efficacy of novel therapies for suppressing SRS and improving cognitive and neuropathological changes associated with severe mTLE. This rodent model of TLE recapitulates many of the neuropathological hallmarks in mTLE, including severe seizures, loss of GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus, Ammon’s Horn sclerosis, and cognitive impairments (Swartz et al., 2006). Although some patients with mTLE can be treated successfully anti-convulsant medications, about one-third experience intractable pharmaco-resistant seizures and surgical removal of the seizure foci are required. If the foci are located in the mesial temporal lobes, surgical removal may not be feasible due to the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and consolidation. For these patient populations, novel treatments are needed. The cost-effective pilocarpine model of TLE in rodents provides an experimental system for testing novel therapies because a high percentage of rodents develop SRS that can be monitored by video electroencephalography (v-EEG) for weeks or months. Novel treatments that suppress seizures can also be studied for their effects on the neuropathological changes observed in this model, including mossy fiber sprouting (Henderson et al., 2014), dispersion of the granule cell layer (Scharfman et al., 2000), and aberrant neurogenesis (Parent et al., 1997).

The abnormality of epithelia is the main cause for many mammary diseases, like mammary tumors (Prat and Perou, 2009). So, it is of great significance to study the cellular heterogeneity of mammary epithelia in normal and disease conditions. And the single cell RNA sequencing is one of the methods used to study the cellular heterogeneity. The mammary epithelium is mainly composed of two distinct lineages, the basal and luminal cells (Shackleton et al., 2006). According to previous studies, these two cells populations could be well distinguished through flow cytometry analysis for the mouse mammary cells by using cell surface markers CD24 and CD29 (or CD24 and CD49f), as the basal and luminal cells are characterized with C D24^M i dC D29^H i cells and CD24HiCD29Lo, respectively (Shackleton et al., 2006). Still little attention was paid on the cell numbers, viability and the separation degree of the cells in the flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting. But the cell quality is very important for the single cell RNAseq experiments. To meet this end, we devised a protocol with the combination of the red blood cells’ removal, epithelial cells’ enrichment, and futher cell sorting to separate basal and luminal cells with high cell viability. It’s a better approach to prepare single cells suspension for single cell RNA sequencing. Besides, the protocol has been verified for its adaption towards other solid organs, like liver and brain, as well as tumor/cancer tissues from breast, liver, colon and other organs of mouse and human.

To have these molecular machines assembled in a timely manner in a precise cellular location is critical for cellular activities, including protein synthesis, chromosome segregation, nuclear transport, signaling, motility and other diverse functions. Typically, the formation of many multimeric complexes is thought to occur in a stepwise manner via recruitment and integration of subunits or subcomplexes, which are bridged to existing molecules within the larger assembly by a physical proteinprotein contact. Understanding the assembly of large macromolecular complexes is historically the job of biochemists and crystallographers who employ an arsenal of techniques: purification of complexes to determine the identity of subunits, co-purification of proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening, in vitro binding assays, chemical cross-linking studies and structural analysis to understand protein-protein interactions, and finally, reconstitution of the complex to determine the hierarchy of assembly.

However, only 1% of the microbial communities can be cultured in the laboratory conditions while 99% are still unexplored because they are non-culturable. Total soil DNA extraction potentially onsets the journey of revealing hidden microbial diversity (Robe et al., 2003; Fatima et al., 2011 and 2014; Lamizadeh et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1612	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3519	Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of the Protein-protein	SPR, EhP3, 14-3-3, Entamoeba histolytica, Cytoskeleton/actin Background Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has emerged as one of the most promising screening tools to study macromolecular interactions, since its inception in the early 1990s (Nguyen et al., 2015). It helps determine binding affinities, kinetic parameters, and specificity of these interactions in real-time. This technique is simply based on the optical property of light and principally measures the change in the refractive index upon binding of any molecule to the surface. Surface Plasmon Resonance utilizes the interaction occurring between light and matter. The SPR signal is determined at the surface of the sensor, thus it can be easily correlated to the macromolecules bound on it. This technique captures the real time binding between interacting molecules in a label-free manner, thus making it easy to perform and analyze. Moreover, unlike ITC, this technique is not solution based and uses solid surface for ligand immobilization. SPR uses low quantities of reagents, thus working with small sample size is not an issue.

Bio-protocol-1619	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3512	Rapid Nickel-based Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles from Different Biological Fluids	Extracellular vesicles, OMVs, Nickel, Biomarkers, Liquid biopsies Background Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous membranous structures that cells release in the extracellular fluids. Besides the generation of apoptotic bodies, we now recognize at least two mechanisms that generate EVs, comprising the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in mature endosomes that fuse with the plasma membrane and discharge exosomes, and the direct release of membrane-budding vesicles known as microvesicles or ectosomes (van Niel et al., 2018). EVs are increasingly referred to as intercellular communicators which are able to influence the metabolism of recipient cells through the horizontal exchange of different components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013; Hirshman et al., 2016; Jeppesen et al., 2019). Besides the research efforts aiming to convert EVs into novel carriers of therapeutics, the incredible density and heterogeneity of EVs present in biological fluids hold promise for the interception of pathological conditions such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases (Schiera et al., 2015; Bandu et al., 2019; Latifkar et al., 2019). Especially in cancer, this perspective is nowadays expanding the field of liquid biopsy tests, where the non-invasive detection of biomarkers through a systematic screening of circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA, and EVs could advance early detection and monitoring, with novel opportunities for patients’ stratification and prediction of disease progression.
Bio-protocol-1620	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3511	Structural Alignment and Covariation Analysis of RNA Sequences	RNA, Sequence, Structure, Alignment, Covariation, Comparative analysis Background Biological RNA molecules fold into specific secondary (2D) and tertiary (3D) structures that are critical for their function. Therefore, for comparative analysis, which usually requires sequence alignment, it is desirable to take structure information into account in order to obtain a more reliable and meaningful alignment. Numerous computational algorithms and tools have been developed to generate alignments based on secondary structure, such as MAFFT (Katoh and Toh, 2008), TurboFold (Tan et al., 2017), R-Coffee (Wilm et al., 2008), locARNA (Will et al., 2007), ProbCons (Do et al., 2005), MXSCARNA (Tabei et al., 2008), and LaRA (Bauer et al., 2007). In a benchmark comparison of these leading tools (Tan et al., 2017) TurboFold and MAFFT were shown to have comparable and highest accuracies. The running time of TurboFold is considerably longer than that of MAFFT (Katoh and Toh, 2008; Tan et al., 2017), thus in this protocol we use MAFFT because its speed, which can be further augmented by parallel processing (Katoh and Standley, 2013), allows alignment of a large number (>00) of sequences in a limited amount time. Like several of the other tools MAFFT employs an iterative strategy where pairwise structural alignments are first computed and are then progressively combined into a multiple alignment through several rounds of refinement.

Bio-protocol-1622	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3509	Visualization of Actin Organization and Quantification in Fixed Arabidopsis Pollen Grains and Tubes	Arabidopsis, Pollen germination, Pollen grain, Pollen tube, Actin, Phalloidin staining Background Pollen germination and subsequent pollen tube growth is the critical step during sexual plant reproduction, as it provides passage for the delivery of two non-motitle sperm cells to finally effect double fertilization in flowering plants (McCormick, 2013). How pollen germination and pollen tube growth are regulated has been subject to intensive scrutiny in the past several decades. It was shown that actin is an essential regulator of pollen germination and pollen tube growth and morphogenesis (Gibbon et al., 1999; Vidali et al., 2001). As pollen germination and pollen tube growth are very sensitive to the perturbation on the actin cytoskeleton (Gibbon et al., 1999; Vidali et al., 2001), and considering along with the fact that Arabidopsis thaliana is amenable to genetic analysis, Arabidopsis pollen has increasingly becoming the great cellular system in documenting the organization and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton toward understanding how actin performs functions in pollen (Qu et al., 2015). Arabidopsis pollen cell is an excellent cellular system to study the organization and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is also because the spatial organization of actin is very regular in pollen cells (Ren and Xiang, 2007; Cheung and Wu, 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Staiger et al., 2010; Fu, 2015; Qu et al., 2015), and it is therefore comparatively easy to quantify the organization of actin in pollen cells (Fu, 2015; Qu et al., 2015). The colleagues in this field have developed different methods in revealing the organization of actin in pollen cells, including staining with fluorescent-phalloidin or immune-staining probed with anti-actin antibody in fixed Arabidopsis pollen cells as well as decoration with different actin markers in living pollen cells. Compared to immuno-staining with anti-actin antibody in fixed pollen cells, actin staining with fluorescent phalloidin can yield more cleanly filamentous images as phalloidin specifically binds to actin filaments with high affinity that reduces the background noise, which will facilitate subsequent analysis and quantification of actin organization in pollen cells. In addition, the procedure of actin staining with fluorescent phalloidin is comparatively simple and straightforward. Furthermore, the whole procedure was completed on solid pollen germination medium, which minimizes the effect of various treatments on the morphology of pollen tubes. This method has been carried out routinely and successfully in our laboratory. The detailed method can be found in series of our previously published papers (Wu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2013; Chang and Huang, 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Qu et al., 2017; Lan et al., 2018; Diao et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019) and the papers from our colleagues in this community (Gebert et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017).

There is estimated to be 357 million new infections annually and STIs have been identified by the WHO as a global priority for elimination (WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Sexually Transmitted Infections 2016-2021). Among the various bacterial STI, Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common STI (Starnbach, 2018) and stands first with a 131 million new infections annually worldwide (Poston et al., 2017). High reinfection in the genital tract is exacerbated by chronic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, and fallopian tube scaring (O’Connell and Ferone, 2016) resulting in infertility and other malignancies. The major hurdle in controlling chlamydial spread is that the infection remains asymptomatic, thus leading to chronic, recurrent and persistent infections, with no vaccines developed so far.

Many researchers have investigated such behaviors by pioneering methods to record neural activity in freely moving rodents, including static electrode arrays or microdrives (Vandecasteele et al., 2012; Voigts et al., 2013; Okun et al., 2016). However, these techniques are not at pace with recent advancements in the spatial and temporal resolution of recording devices such as Neuropixels probes (Jun et al., 2017). Although previous studies have demonstrated the use of silicon probes in freely moving animals (Okun et al., 2016), we sought to design a device that would also enable the recycling of valuable Neuropixels probes. Our device, the AMIE, can be used to implant Neuropixels probes for experiments that record neural activity over weeks of behavior. After experiments, the AMIE can be explanted and used in additional experiments (Juavinett et al., 2019). Importantly, the AMIE can also be adapted for similar recording devices and for recording from various parts of the brain. As we have previously demonstrated, this device can empower researchers to use and reuse these probes to simultaneously record hundreds of neurons in freely moving animals (Juavinett et al., 2019). Here, we provide a detailed protocol for other researchers to do the same.

Bio-protocol-1630	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3501	A Simple and Efficient Method for Concomitant Isolation and Culture of Enriched Astroglial and Microglial Cells from the Rat Spinal Cord	Primary cultures, Microglia, Astrocytes, Astroglia, Spinal cord Background Astrocytes and microglial cells play a crucial role during the development, as well as in the normal physiology and pathology of the nervous system. These include structural, vascular, metabolic and neuro-regulatory functions like modulation of transmission by forming ‘quad-partite synapses’, release of gliotransmitters and trophic factors, and integration of neuronal-glial networks (Parpura et al., 1994; Araque et al., 1999; Schafer et al., 2013; Michell-Robinson et al., 2015; Rossi, 2015). Microglia, in addition to the canonical immune functions, also plays an important role in adult neurogenesis, differentiation, maturation and integration within the neuronal circuitry (Rezaie and Male, 2002; Polazzi and Monti, 2010; Michell-Robinson et al., 2015; Ransohoff and El Khoury, 2015). In response to a pathological insult, the glial cells react by undergoing morphological and physiological changes and rescue the vulnerable neurons from the insult (Ferraiuolo et al., 2011; Pekny et al., 2014; Mishra et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017). At the tissue level, astrocytes undergo morphological transformation from protoplasmic to fibrillary phenotype and move to the site of injury to create a physical barrier between damaged and healthy cells, or by forming glial scars in a process called reactive gliosis. In a similar manner, microglia undergo morphological transformation from the resting/ramified phenotype to the activated/amoeboid phenotype, via intermediate activation stages, (Rezaie and Male, 2002; Michell-Robinson et al., 2015; Ransohoff and El Khoury, 2015). Both the glial cell types thus promote neuronal repair through acute inflammation, which modulates the microenvironment by regulating production and release of trophic factors, gliotransmitters, cytokines and chemokines (Raivich et al., 1999; Parpura et al., 2012; Verkhratsky and Butt, 2013; Pekny et al., 2014). Reactive gliosis is reversible and beneficial during the acute insult. However, in response to prolonged insult or genetic dysregulation, the balance is disrupted and may lead to irreversible and erroneous activation resulting in chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration (Lobsiger and Cleveland, 2007). Therefore, delineating the precise glial response as well as their role in modulating neuronal physiology becomes relevant. However, an in vivo approach may present with a disadvantage owing to the complex neuron-glial and glial-glial interactions, which dynamically modulate these changes at the tissue level. Primary glial cultures help us to overcome this issue, by enabling observations in an isolated cell-type model system. In vitro experimentation also widens the scope for further comparing the effect of neuron-glial/glial-glial interactions through a co-culture model system.

Bio-protocol-1635	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3496	Low-cost and Multiplexable Whole mRNA-Seq Library Preparation Method with Oligo-dT Magnetic Beads for Illumina Sequencing Platforms	RNA-Seq, mRNA, Multiplexing, Transcriptome, Illumina Background In the last decade, sequencing cost has been reduced drastically thanks to the advance in massive parallel sequencing technologies (Muir et al., 2016). On the other hand, the cost at library preparation step stands out. For example, commercial kits for RNA-Seq library preparation such as TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit (illumine, USA) and NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) cost around 40-60 dollars per sample. Recently, several studies have developed cost-effective RNA-Seq library preparation methods (Kumar et al., 2012; Nagano et al., 2015; Townsley et al., 2015; Alpern et al., 2019; Kamitani et al., 2019). Particularly, 3′ RNA-Seq protocols (Lasy-Seq and BRB-Seq), enable early-pooling of samples resulting in reducing the cost into about two dollar per sample (Alpern et al., 2019; Kamitani et al., 2019). While z^ RNA-Seq is economically superior to whole mRNA-Seq method, whole mRNA-Seq can sequence full-length of RNA. Thus, whole mRNA-Seq is good for detection of splicing variants and novel transcripts. Although our previously-developed protocol of whole mRNA-Seq using rRNA depletion is cheap (Nagano et al., 2015), it requires many kinds of antisense oligo against rRNA and enzymes for reverse transcription, 2^n d strand synthesis, end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation and library amplification. In this protocol, (1) we replaced rRNA depletion against mRNA-purification using oligo-dT beads in order to reduce initial cost. (2) Enzymes required for end-repair to library amplification were replaced with KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche, Switzerland); this simplification increases reaction efficiency as well as reduce labor. (3) We saved reaction volumes throughout all steps (eq20ul) , which saves cost and enables handling even with 384-well plates. The required cost is approximately one-third of the golden standard kits. (4) We designed 300 kinds of z^ PCR primers with barcode sequences for multiplexing, which enabled us to sequence 300 samples at a time with a cost-effective and ultra-high-throughput sequencer such as NovaSeq.

The proliferating phase contains immature vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2)+ cells that appear to be in the process of vasculogenesis–the assembly of new vessels from stem/progenitor cells (Yu et al., 2004; Boscolo and Bischoff, 2009). The involuting phase begins after 12 months of age; well-defined vascular channels become evident yet little is known about mechanisms of involution except that endothelial apoptosis increases in the involuting phase (Mancini and Smoller 1996; Iwata et al., 1996; Razon et al., 1998). The residuum in the involuted phase is characterized by sparse vessels, adipocytes and connective tissue. This natural life-cycle of endothelial maturation and involution distinguishes IH from other vascular tumors and malformations, which do not regress and can grow at any time in a patient’s life. In 2008, we isolated a primitive mesenchymal cell from proliferating phase IH that can differentiate into endothelial cells, pericytes and adipocytes and form hemangiomalike (GLUT1-positive) vessels within 7 days after being implanted sub-cutaneously into immune-deficient mice (Khan et al., 2008). We designated these hemangioma stem cells (HemSC); subsequent studies validated HemSCs as the IH-initiating cell (Greenberger et al., 2010; Itinteang et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; Mai et al., 2013; Harbi et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2017). Here we describe in detail how to isolate HemSC from proliferating phase IH, and at the same time isolate GLUT1-positive HemEC, GLUT1- negative HemEC and HemPericytes; this allows detailed studies on patient-derived cells that represent the vascular cellular constituents of IH. In principal, the strategy could be broadly applied to other types of vascular tumors and vascular malformations, in particular isolation of endothelial cells from venous malformations (Goines et al., 2018), capillary malformations (Huang et al., 2017), arteriovenous malformations (Couto et al., 2017) and lymphatic malformations (Boscolo et al., 2015).

Therefore, the level of available NADP+ in photosynthesis is quite important for autotrophic growth (Hashida and KawaiYamada, 2019).
Bio-protocol-1652	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3479	The Mouse Gambling Task: Assessing Individual Decision-making Strategies in Mice	Decision-making, Mouse, Inter-individual differences, Gambling, Reward, Maze, Strategies Background Decision-making is a cognitive process which consists of choosing one option among several alternatives. It progresses from the exploration of unknown options to the exploitation of preferred ones (Bechara et al., 1994). During this cognitive process, the decision maker evaluates the value of each option regarding his/her own preferences and the probability to get it. This computation brings him/her to select one strategy among others. Such strategies are featured in the Iowa gambling task (IGT), a decision-making task that mimics real life situations by reproducing uncertain conditions based on probabilistic rewards or penalties (Bechara et al., 1994). During this task, subjects have to implicitly discover (through somatic markers) which option is advantageous in the long term, with the progressive discovery that options are not available under fixed and predictable contingencies. Several authors adapted the IGT in rodents (de Visser et al., 2011a; van den Bos et al., 2014) to study neurobiological substrates of decision-making (non-exhaustive exemples: Homberg et al., 2008; Pais

Arrhythmias as result of changes in the structure, rate and rhythm of the cardiac conduction system underlie many cardiac disorders. In the past, a lack of availability of homogenous conduction system cell lines has proven to be a hindrance to investigators wishing to study the function of conduction system cells in health and disease. The emergence of transgenic animal models of cardiac abnormalities provides an even greater impetus to reliably isolate healthy conduction system cells. Intact nodes allow investigations into expression profiles of important signaling proteins and genes using immunohistochemistry and qPCR approaches. More detailed functional analysis is possible on isolated single nodal cells using patch-clamp for example. The SAN tissue and the cells it consists of were first isolated many decades ago (Noble and Tsien, 1968). However, the cell population isolated was generally a mixed population. SAN specific cells were first isolated from rabbit SAN by DiFranscesco et al. (1986) in the mid-1980s to allow study of ion channel expression. More recently, the protocol was adapted for isolation of SAN cells from mice by Mangoni and Nargeot (2001). This has allowed transgenic mouse models specific to the SAN to be studied in greater detail. We describe the procedure for isolating the SAN tissue and single SAN cells. The intact node can be used for investigation of gene and protein expression as well as for tissue histology, whilst acutely isolated cells can be interrogated in detail for their electrophysiological properties.

Thermospore represents resting phase/form of thermophilic bacteria which has the ability to survive under adverse conditions over a long time period and revive after arrival of favorable conditions. According to the thermophilic nature of these Bacilli, these spores are named “thermospores”. Thermophilic bacteria Gram-positive and few Gram-negative would initiate process of formation of endospores upon onset of adverse conditions such as high or low temperature, salt, nutrients, water activity, oxic and anoxic conditions. Thermospore can survive in natural harsh environment (hot springs, hydrothermal areas, acid mines, alkaline lakes, salt lakes, ocean waters and sun-heated soils) and artificial extreme environments (xenobiotic environments, dumping sites, heaters, geysers, compost piles and dry areas). According to the growth temperature, microorganisms can be classified into psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles, extreme thermophiles and hyperthermophiles.

Bio-protocol-1659	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3472	Unbiased and Tailored CRISPR/Cas gRNA Libraries by Synthesizing Covalently-closed-circular (3Cs) DNA	CRISPR/Cas, gRNA library, 3Cs technology, 3Cs gRNA, Gene editing, CRISPR screen Background CRISPR/Cas gene editing has developed to be the gold standard for tailored and unbiased high-throughput screening (Doench, 2018). Unbiased pooled screening enables the simultaneous testing of thousands of individual genetic perturbations in a single experiment. However, a prerequisite is the presence of a gRNA library, in which each individual construct defines a specific genomic target site (gRNA sequence), at which the gene perturbation is desired, with a library’s gRNA distribution and diversity dictating the experimental scale (Sanson et al., 2018). Classically, protocols to generate CRISPR/Cas gRNA libraries for arrayed or pooled applications contain T4 ligase or recombination-based ligations steps, requiring DNA polymerase-dependent amplification of the gRNAencoding oligonucleotides coupled with restriction enzyme-digested plasmid DNA for subsequent gRNA cloning (Koike-Yusa et al., 2014; Shalem et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015; Vidigal and Ventura, 2015; Arakawa, 2016; Ong et al., 2017). Due to these technical limitations, the resulting gRNA libraries contain undesired PCR and cloning-dependent sequence biases in their gRNA sequence distribution that directly affects the experimental scale needed for robust hit calling (Shalem et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Unbiased and tailored CRISPR/Cas gRNA screening is becoming more ubiquitous, highlighting the need for novel protocols to generate gRNA libraries that can readily be established in non-expert laboratories.
Bio-protocol-1660	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3471	A Yeast Chromatin-enriched Fractions Purification Approach,	Chromatin, Proteins, Yeast, Mass spectrometry, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Background DNA-protein macrocomplexes are usually insoluble and lost while obtaining chromatin fractions (Lambert et al., 2009). To maximize DNA-protein recovery, cellular fractionation has been used in several organisms, such as Xenopus (Liang and Stillman, 1997; Khoudoli et al., 2008), Caenorhabditis elegans (Chu et al., 2006), humans (Du et al., 2006; Foltz et al., 2006; Foltz et al., 2009), rice (Tan et al., 2007) or budding yeast (Frei and Gasser, 2000; Kubota et al., 2011). In most cases, these studies have been accompanied by proteomic analyses conducted by mass spectrometry, including quantitative mass spectrometry (Kubota et al., 2011; Lambert et al., 2012). The chromatin immunoprecipitation method (ChIP) emerged as an alternative to the above-mentioned approaches and allows interactions to be identified between protein and genomic DNA regions (Aparicio et al., 2004). However, the use of formaldehyde for in vivo crosslinking renders this method less efficient for proteomic analyses (Metz et al., 2004). ChIP combined with mass spectrometry has also been used in mouse embryonic stem cells or other model organisms (Lambert et al., 2010; Engelen et al., 2015). Notably a method based on ChIP, termed mChIP, has also been developed including protein affinity purification from chromatin that is most useful for mass spectrometry analyses (Lambert et al., 2009 and 2010).

Bio-protocol-1663	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3468	Protocol for Ribosome Profiling in Bacteria	Ribosome profiling, Ribosome pausing, Translational efficiency, Gene expression, Bacteria Background mRNAs are translated at varying efficiencies depending on properties inherent to the mRNA such as initiation rates, mRNA structure, and codon usage. In addition, physiological changes in the cell can alter how efficiently mRNAs are translated. Ribosome profiling was developed to monitor gene expression at the level of protein synthesis, making it possible to ask global questions about which regions of the genome are translated, when they are translated, and how translation is regulated. First developed by Ingolia and Weissman in yeast (Ingolia et al., 2009), ribosome profiling utilizes nuclease digestion to degrade regions of mRNA that are not occupied by ribosomes, generating ribosome-protected mRNA fragments that are isolated, cloned, and sequenced. When the reads are mapped back to the genome, they reveal the position of ribosomes throughout the transcriptome, providing a powerful tool to monitor translation and its regulation in vivo. Our focus here is the application of ribosome profiling to bacteria, first reported by Weissman and Bukau (Oh et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2013). Our protocol is derived from these pioneering studies and incorporates recent improvements described by Ingolia for yeast and mammalian cells (McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017).

Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms in this fundamental process. To elucidate  the molecular mechanisms  involved in  the  regulation  of  IL-10  gene  expression  in macrophages upon interaction with apoptotic cells, we developed this protocol to explore key regulators of IL-10 production induced by apoptotic cells.

In the course of evolution higher vertebrates have lost the regenerative potential while primitive vertebrates have enormous capability to regenerate their lost vision. Studying the regenerative events in primitive organisms such as zebrafish can be a hope for mammalian regeneration studies. Zebrafish have been used for retina regeneration studies with various injury paradigms being used. The photobleaching method damages the photoreceptor cells, while chemical methods damage the ganglion cell layer. Mechanical injury by the stab wound method maintains a uniform injury to all retinal layers. Various approaches including transgenic approaches have been used to find the relevance of genetic events during retina regeneration. Here we are describing the in vivo method for mRNA transfection which allows manipulation of gene expression levels above endogenous levels.
Bio-protocol-1666	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3465	Semi-quantitative Determination of Protein Expression Using	Immunohistochemistry, Semi-quantification, Fiji ImageJ, DAB staining, Hematoxylin Background Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been widely used for investigating protein expression and localization within tissues (Matkowskyj et al., 2000; Cregger et al., 2006; Taylor and Levenson, 2006; Braun et al., 2013; Fedchenko and Reifenrath, 2014; Bauman et al., 2016; Pike et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018; Crowe et al., 2019), and various software and methods have been used in semi-quantiative IHC to conduct deconvolution and downstream analysis. Some methods require advanced coding/mathematical experience or the use of subscription-based software that may not be feasible for every scientist (Matkowskyj et al., 2000; Shu et al., 2016; Guirado et al., 2018). Fiji (ImageJ) is a freely available software (version 1.2; WS Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Publications using ImageJ for image quantification are often directed towards the creation of specific plugins for ImageJ or lack a step-by-step protocol (Varghese et al., 2014; Chen Y, 2017; Guirado et al., 2018). However, there is no integrated protocol that includes a detailed but simple procedure of conducting such steps, including the use of ImageJ software. There are many open online forums where users post their questions about using Fiji ImageJ for image quantification purposes. This is often due to publications not providing sufficiently detailed methods sections, which makes it difficult for the reader to reproduce the data. It is also time-consuming for researchers who are not initially familiar with ImageJ software to figure out how to use this software. The current protocol provides an example for conducting semi-quantitative analysis of IHC images using ImageJ.

Although zoospores are often described as a kind of spore because of their function in the life cycle of producing organisms, attention must be paid to the fact that they are not dormant cells when they are swimming. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms produce zoospores, but eukaryotic zoospores produced by protists and fungi are more well-known compared with prokaryotic zoospores. Members of a fungal phylum of chytridiomycota, as well as oomycetes (which are pseudomycetes), are known to develop zoospores (Sharma et al., 2015; Letcher and Powell, 2017). Zoospores of these microorganisms swim in aquatic environments and adhere to the surface of organic substances, including parasitism hosts and dead bodies of animals and plants. In bacteria, several rare actinomycetes are known to produce zoospores, which are developed in a sporangium or by the fragmentation of aerial hyphae. A wide variety of bacterial zoospores have been isolated from natural environments by taking advantage of their chemotactic property (Hayakawa et al., 1991). Importantly, bacterial zoospores arise from dormant sporangiospores or arthrospores. A rare actinomycete Actinoplanes missouriensis produces terminal sporangia that contain a few hundred flagellated spores. The spores are dormant in a sporangium and, are activated and released to external environments when the sporangium is immersed in water. Although the presence of pili had not been reported in bacterial zoospores, we recently found a biosynthetic gene cluster for functional type IV pili in the A. missouriensis genome sequence, genetically analyzed the gene cluster, and successfully observed the unprecedented zoospore pili in A. missouriensis (Kimura et al., 2019). Furthermore, we developed an adhesion assay for A. missouriensis zoospores to characterize the function of the zoospore pili to attach the zoospores to solid surfaces. A similar adhesion assay for Mycoplasma has already been published by Kasai and Miyata (2013). The adhesion assay described in this protocol can be used not only for zoospores of other species but also for swimming cells of other microorganisms.
Bio-protocol-1674	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3457	cDNA Display Mediated Immuno-PCR (cD-IPCR): A Novel PCR-based Antigen Detection Method	Immuno-polymerase chain reaction, Immuno-detection, cDNA display, qPCR, VHH Background Immuno-PCR, often abbreviated as IPCR, is an extremely powerful method in detection and quantification of low abundance biomarkers that exist in biological samples (e.g., serum and urine). It acts as a bridge between immuno-reaction and signal amplification. In most cases, IPCR relies on the use of a detection antibody which has been conjugated to a reporter oligonucleotide, followed by the quantification of the analytes using real-time PCR of the reporter (Sano et al., 1992). However, in the development and application of IPCR, the difficulty associated with appropriately conjugating antibodies to oligonucleotides has become the most challenging issue (van Buggenum et al., 2016). Strategies available to conjugate the antibody and the DNA include non-covalent conjugation such as coupling via biotin-streptavidin  (Sano  et  al.,  1992)  and  covalent  conjugation  using  chemical  crosslinkers (Hendrickson et al., 1995). However, the tetrameric nature of streptavidin leads to the formation of heterogeneous DNA-antibody conjugates, which may decrease the reproducibility of IPCR. At the same time, conventional crosslinking chemistry reacts with the cysteine/lysine in the antibody, and the modification may compromise binding affinity of the antibody.

Several protein-protein interaction assays have been adopted for studying intramolecular interaction such as co-immunoprecipitation and protein complementation assays (PCAs). Despite being widely employed, there are known limitations of these conventional assays. For instance, co-immunoprecipitation is not ideal for detecting low-affinity interaction. Even though PCAs provide good sensitivity, the reporter fragments may hinder the interaction of interest (Ohad et al., 2007; Miernyk and Thelen, 2008). Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is an innovative technology that allows in situ detection of protein-protein interactions. The protein targets are first labeled by their specific primary antibodies from different species, followed by the recognition of species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotides (PLA probes). Proximity ligation of the oligonucleotides generates the templates for single-stranded rolling circle amplification. The resultant products are detected with fluorescence-labeled complementary oligonucleotide detection probes. PLA offers exceptional specificity and sensitivity as target-specific antibodies and singlestranded rolling circle amplification are involved. The resultant products are detected with fluorescencelabeled complementary oligonucleotide detection probes, and PLA signals can be visualized and quantified by using fluorescence microscopy (Weibrecht et al., 2010). Although the technology has been available for over a decade, the possibility of using PLA for investigating protein intramolecular interaction has not been explored.
Bio-protocol-1683	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3448	Detection of in vivo Protein Interactions in All Bacterial Compartments by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer with the Superfolder mTurquoise2 ox-mNeongreen FRET Pair	Bacteria, Protein interactions, FRET, Cytoplasm, Periplasm, sfTq2ox, mNG Background Determining how and which proteins interact to sustain life is at the core of molecular biology research. Many in vitro methods exist but may result in false positives as the interactions are taken out of their biological context. An in vivo method is crucial for the verification of in vitro obtained results. Moreover, in vivo methods allow for the observation of the often, dynamic processes that take place in the cell. Fluorescent proteins (FP)s are ideal for in vivo experiments as they can be fused to proteins of interest, making it possible to microscopically track the localization and dynamics of the fused proteins in living cells. Energy can be transferred between FPs by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) provided they have compatible physical properties. The emission spectrum of a donor FP must overlap with the excitation spectrum of an acceptor FP and the physical distance between the chromophores within the folded FPs should be less than 10n m . The larger the spectral overlap and the smaller the distance between the donor and acceptor FP the more FRET can occur. The stringent distance dependence for FRET is ideal to detect direct protein-protein interactions as they also occur in the nanometer range, whereas indirect protein interactions are usually on a larger distance scale and not detectable by FRET. For this reason, it gives very few false positives but due to the physical requirements of the involved fluorophores, negative results could be false negatives. The advantage of using FPs for FRET measurements is that the chromophore is enclosed in a protein barrel and therefore much better protected from the environment than chemical chromophores. The fluorescence of the latter is extremely sensitive to environmental changes such as pH, salt, and solvents. Consequently, they often cannot be used reliably to measure FRET in a complicated environment like the living cell. A drawback of the 3–4n m in diameter protein-barrel that encloses the chromophore in FPs is that it reduces the detectable distance between proteins to 1-6 nm. Since 5-7 nm is the typical size of proteins, it usually does not pose a problem, but can again result in false negatives. For a recent perspective on FRET as a biomolecular research tool see Alger et al. (2019). We have used a spectroscopy based FRET method to analyze the interaction between proteins in the cytoplasm and in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (Alexeeva et al., 2010; Fraipont et al, 2011; van der Ploeg et al, 2013 and 2015; Meiresonne et al, 2017 and 2019) and showed that the technique is suitable for mode of action studies of antibiotics (van der Ploeg et al., 2015) and medium throughput screening (Meiresonne et al, 2017 and 2019) using various FP FRET pairs. Building on our experience with bacterial FRET and fluorescent proteins in challenging compartments, we preferentially use the FRET-pair that gives the highest rates of energy transfer in the cytoplasm as well as in the periplasm.

Effects sizes can range from mild to severe. It can be congenital or develop later in life, often in a frequency-dependent age-related progressive manner. Numerous and varied pathologies can contribute to or be responsible for hearing loss (Davis 1995; Fortnum et al., 2001). Environmental conditions, such as noise exposure or drug-toxicity, can also have profound effects on hearing ability. Genetics is known to play many crucial roles in the early development of hearing and in the maintenance of hearing function into old age, as well as in predisposing the auditory system towards pathology or protecting the system against pathological decline. With the development of molecular methods to target the function of specific genes in the mouse and the emergence of phenotyping programs to investigate the systemic roles of these genes, it became necessary to develop a sensitive, rapid, robust and reproducible method to screen hearing function in these mutant animals.

This process is called ‘incubation’ (Neisewander et al., 2000; Grimm et al., 2001 and 2002; Lu et al., 2004a). Incubation has been demonstrated in both preclinical (Shalev et al., 2001; Bienkowski et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2004b; Shepard et al., 2004; Abdolahi et al., 2010) and clinical (Bedi et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Parvaz et al., 2016) studies, and is a target for development of novel treatments for the prevention of drug relapse. In preclinical models of incubation, animals are first trained to self-administer a given drug of abuse and then, following successful learning of operant responding, tested for drug seeking under extinction conditions (i.e., in the absence of drug reward) at different time points during abstinence. To date, incubation studies have focused on how discrete cues paired with drug delivery during training (i.e., conditioned stimuli, CSs) can potentiate drug seeking during abstinence. Another type of cue critical to performance of drug-taking behavior has been overlooked:

Worldwide, it has a seroprevalence of approximately 67% that varies from 30% to more than 90% in different human groups, depending on the age, the socio-economic status, and the geographical region (Nahmias et al., 1990; reviewed in Smith and Robinson, 2002; Looker et al., 2015). HSV-1 shares several features with all herpesviruses: (i) a conserved virion architecture, (ii) productive and lytic infection of cells and (iii) establishment of life-long-latent infection in the host (Whitley and Griffiths, 2002; Schleiss, 2009).

The myelination of axons provides electrical insulation and thus facilitates saltatory impulse propagation in a highly efficient manner (Tasaki, 1939; Hartline and Colman, 2007). In addition to insulation, myelinating cells may provide trophic support for myelinated axons (Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003; Nave, 2010; Funfschilling et al., 2012; Joseph et al., 2019).

The disease outcome varies depending on different factors including the infecting species, the immune response of the host, the presence of an endosymbiotic virus within Leishmania parasites (Ives et al., 2011), or the co-infection with viruses such human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV) which can be detrimental for disease exacerbation (van Griensven et al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2017). Therefore, the study of parasite persistence using murine models has emerged in the past years (Eren et al., 2016). The quantification of parasite burden in experimental models of Leishmania infection has been commonly quantified by either Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) or by limiting dilution assays upon euthanasia of animals (Hartley et al., 2016). In this protocol, we report a non-invasive technique for the quantification of parasite burden during the disease progression using luciferase expressing parasites (Ives et al., 2011; Hartley et al., 2018). Moreover, this approach can also be applied for the in vivo detection  of  other  chemiluminescent  agents  such  as  luminol  that  is  used  as  a  readout  of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, or for any other organism expressing luciferase.
Bio-protocol-1701	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3430	ELISA Based Protein Ubiquitylation Measurement	Ubiquitin, ELISA, Poly-ubiquitylation, Protein degradation, CFTR, Membrane protein Background Protein ubiquitylation facilitates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations of misfolded proteins such as ∆F508 CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), resulting in the genetic disease, Cystic Fibrosis. In addition, protein ubiquitylation regulates selective autophagy, receptor  endocytosis,  and  intracellular  signal  transductions.  K48-linked  poly-ubiquitylation  and K63-linked  poly-ubiquitylation  facilitates  proteasomal  and  lysosomal  degradations,  respectively. Therefore, quantitative analysis of protein ubiquitylation and specific poly-ubiquitin chain configurations of the protein-of-interest present as significant information in understanding the ubiquitylation-mediated processes.

For example, cell movement allows embryonic and tumor development, wound healing and immune responses. Morphology reflects different stages of cell growth, differentiation and disease. Cell-to-cell contacts or distance to sources of chemical cues are involved in chemokinesis, differentiation, neural function, and immune responses. Finally, fluorescent protein fusions reveal interesting molecular behavior, such as protein relocalization within cells upon various stimuli. Using smMOCa, these cells can easily be isolated for their extensive characterization. Other approaches that allow the identification of cells without knowledge of a specific marker are based on photoactivated fluorescent proteins (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002;

Bio-protocol-1707	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3424	SarkoSpin: A Technique for Biochemical Isolation and Characterization	TDP-43, Aggregation, SarkoSpin, ALS, FTLD Background Protein aggregation in affected neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (Soto et al., 2003). In two of the most devastating forms, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the principal aggregating protein is TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) (Ling et al., 2013). Under pathological conditions, TDP-43 is abnormally ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved, and is sequestered in insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions that include both the full-length protein as well as its highly-aggregation prone C-terminal fragment (Neumann et al., 2006; Arai et al., 2006). TDP-43 inclusions account for virtually all ALS patients and for up to 45% of FTLD patients, suggesting that ALS and FTLD are the two ends of a single clinical, genetic and pathological spectrum (Ling et al., 2013). FTLD cases can be subdivided into at least three subtypes (A, B and C) based on the shape and location of the aggregated TDP-43 (Lee et al., 2017), and it was recently shown that different biochemical features of the pathological TDP-43 may underlie this heterogeneity (Laferriere et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1712	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3419	F-actin Bundle Sedimentation Assay	Actin crosslinker, Actin bundle, Dynamin, GTPase, Invadosome Background Dynamin is a membrane remodeling GTPase best-known for catalyzing membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis to release vesicles from the plasma membrane (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Schmid and Frolov, 2011; Antonny et al., 2016). In addition to its indispensable role for membrane fission, dynamin is also localized to actin-rich structures, such as lamellilpodia, dorsal membrane ruffles, and invadosomes, where it regulates actin reorganization via interacting with other actin polymerization factors (Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012). It has been discovered that the neuronal isoform of dynamin, dynamin-1 (Dyn1), could directly interact with actin filaments and facilitate the rate of actin polymerization (Gu et al., 2010). Subsequently, the ubiquitously expressed dynamin isoform, dynamin-2 (Dyn2), was also proved to be equipped with actin bundling activity and to affect the structure and stiffness of the protrusive actin-based structure, invadosome (Chuang et al., 2019). Here we detail the simple method to quantitatively analyze the actin bundling activity of Dyn1 and Dyn2. Dynamin may be substituted with other actin-binding and crosslinking proteins with proper adjustments of protein concentration, incubation time, or buffer composition in order to test their actin bundling activity.

Bio-protocol-1718	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3413	Implementing VIPER for Imaging Cellular Proteins by Fluorescence Microscopy	Protein tag, Fluorescence, Labeling, Microscopy, Cell biology, Peptide, Biochemistry Background Fluorescence microscopy (FM) enables researchers to observe the architecture and assembly of proteins in cells dynamically and in multicolor (Liu et al., 2015; Valm et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Fluorescence imaging relies on strategies for labeling target proteins with bright, fluorescent reporter molecules. Labeling can be achieved in a number of ways (Giepmans et al., 2006; Crivat and Taraska, 2012; Vandemoortele et al., 2019), including immunolabeling, fluorescent proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein) (Shaner et al., 2005; Snapp, 2009), chemical stains (e.g., DAPI, MitoTracker, or phalloidin conjugates) (Cottet-Rousselle et al., 2011; Bucevičius et al., 2018), and self-labeling tags (Keppler et al., 2003; Gautier et al., 2008; Los et al., 2008). The most useful tags can be used to deliver diverse chemical reporters with optimal properties, such as spectrally-distinct  colors,  high  quantum  yield  and  extinction  coefficient  (“brightness”),  and photostability (Dempsey et al., 2001; Li and Vaughan, 2018). Tags that can bind to a variety of bright fluorophore ligands include the SNAP tag (Keppler et al., 2003; Gautier et al., 2008), Halo tag (Los et al., 2008), TMP tag (Miler et al., 2005), and FAPs (Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2008). However, these protein tags are large ( 18-33k D a) , which can change protein folding, trafficking, and function (Brock et al., 1999; Costantini and Snapp, 2013; Huang et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2015). A few peptide tags have been described for cell imaging, as exemplified by the tetracysteine tag, but these can have non-specific interactions and limited color choices (Griffin et al., 1998; Gaietta et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-1719	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3412	Generation of CoilR Probe Peptides for VIPER-labeling of Cellular Proteins	Peptide, Bioconjugation, Genetic tag, Microscopy, Chemical biology, Fluorescent Background Fluorescence microscopy (FM), electron microscopy (EM), and correlative light and EM (CLEM) enable investigations into the multi-protein complexes and macromolecular interactions that mediate normal and disease-associated cellular functions. However, multiscale microscopy is restricted by the shortage of methods for attaching FM-, EM-, and CLEM-compatible reporter chemistries to target proteins. Additionally, there are few methods for protein labeling that facilitate switching between imaging systems. As a result, most multiscale imaging studies obtain protein-specific contrast with immunolabeling. However, there are known drawbacks to immunolabeling. The large size of antibodies reduces localization precision, and labeling protocols can disrupt cellular ultra-structure (Schnell et al., 2012). Scarce proteins and rare interactions can elude detection unless immunolabeling is efficient (Griffiths and Hoppeler, 1986; Schnell et al., 2012; Griffiths and Lucocq, 2014). Many antibodies have poor target specificity and cross-reactivity (Berglund et al., 2008; Bordeaux et al., 2010; Baker, 2015; Bradbury and Pluckthun, 2015), which can result in misleading observations.
Bio-protocol-1720	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3411	Model of Chemotherapy-associated Mucositis and Oral Opportunistic Infections	Oral mucositis, Organotypic, Candida, Chemotherapy, BrdU, Caspase 3 Background Candida albicans is a fungal commensal of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract implicated in opportunistic mucosal and disseminated infections  in immunocompromised hosts (Westbrook et al., 2013). Clinical studies have shown that risk factors associated with candidemia go beyond the frequently described use of central venous catheters; they are also associated with the use of high dose chemotherapeutic agents. Under this scenario, the mucosal barrier integrity is decreased, resulting in life threatening systemic dissemination (Nucci et al., 1998; Lalla et al., 2014). We have recently started to explore the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy in Candida albicans mucosal infection. We showed that this fungus can amplify the proinflammatory epithelial response to the cytotoxic drug 5- FU in vitro, (Sobue et al., 2018) and it can promote a dysbiotic state in vivo, that causes increased oral mucosal barrier breach (Bertolini et al., 2019). 5-fluorouracil is a chemotherapeutic agent used for treatment of a variety of metastatic cancers including breast, gastrointestinal tract and head & neck. In this patient population oral thrush and/or candidemia with disseminated multi-organ infection are prevalent and most frequently attributed to C. albicans (Teoh and Pavelka, 2016).
Bio-protocol-1722	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3409	Amplex Red Assay for Measuring Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Caenorhabditis elegans	Amplex, Hydrogen peroxide, C. elegans, ROS, NADPH oxidase, Oxidative burst, Pathogen Background Interest in developing assays to study the amount and type of reactive oxygen species produced by C. elegans was primarily driven by the use of this model organism in studies focused on aging and infection. Oxidative damage caused by ROS has long been hypothesized to contribute to aging, and therefore measuring the intracellular oxidative environment and how it changes over time and in various aging mutants is relevant. Likewise, ROS are generated during the C. elegans immune response where they are capable of acting as signaling or effector molecules. Understanding the sources of ROS and being able to measure their magnitude is therefore of key importance (reviewed by Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; McCallum and Garsin, 2016; Miranda-Vizuete and Veal, 2017). Commonly used methods to measure ROS in C. elegans include dihydrofluorescein dyes, the genetically encoded HyPer probe, and the Amplex® Red assay. Additional methods with more specific applications include MioSox, a modified dihydroethidium (DHE) that is specific for measuring ROS in the mitochondria, and the Grx1-roGFP2 genetically-encoded probe that measures changes in redox potential (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). All current methodologies that measure ROS have caveats that must be carefully considered when deciding what method to use and how to interpret the results.

Bio-protocol-1725	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3406	Optogenetic Food Odor Avoidance Assay	Mouse, Optogenetics, Olfactory, Feeding, Circuit, Neuroscience Background Sensory cues can dramatically influence feeding behavior. Apart from taste, olfaction is a predominant sensory modality in feeding. The scent of food can override homeostatic mechanisms to influence or diminish the drive to eat (Li and Liberles, 2015). Furthermore, olfaction has been shown to impact both food intake and metabolism (Riera et al., 2017). Interestingly, hypothalamic feedingassociated regions–such as the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)–are modulated by olfactory perception of food (Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Jennings et al., 2015). Connected brain regions also integrate sensory information to regulate feeding. These regions include the anterior portion of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), hindbrain (including the nucleus tractus solitarius), parabrachial nucleus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Waterson and Horvath, 2015; Rossi and Stuber, 2018). However, the circuit mechanisms by which olfactory information is relayed to the hypothalamus and other feeding-associated nodes are not well understood. To interrogate the circuitry relaying sensory cues to the hypothalamus, we must be able to manipulate circuit activity in a cell-type specific manner. Previous experiments have utilized a variety of methods to manipulate neurons to assay food intake such as toxin mediated ablation, and chemogenetics (Luquet et al., 2005; Herman et al., 2016; Stamatakis et al., 2016). Optogenetics allows for precise spatial and temporal control of neuronal activity when combined with conditional viral genetic approaches (Adamantidis et al., 2007; Jennings et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2019). Previous optogenetic assays have shown particular neural circuits are capable of modulating food intake and appetitive behaviors, however, they do not investigate the sensory component of feeding behaviors (Jennings et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2016).

Although these two retroviruses have similar life cycles, they differ in that HIV-2 displays lower pathogenicity, translating into longer progression time to AIDS and reduced transmissibility (Marvin et al.,2015; Azevedo-Pereira and Santos-Costa, 2016). Another distinct feature of HIV-2 is that the plasma viral RNA load of infected individuals is significantly lower, compared with those infected with HIV-1 (Berry et al., 1998; Popper et al., 1999; Andersson et al., 2000). The cellular viral DNA load in peripheral blood has, instead, been suggested to be similar between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections (Ariyoshi et al., 1996; Popper et al., 2000; Damond et al., 2001). However, others have indicated that also the DNA load is lower in HIV-2, compared with HIV-1, infection (Gueudin et al., 2008). Overall, HIV2 DNA load quantification studies are relatively few, and most studies have not considered a protocol for a house-keeping gene to quantify the number of cells used in the reaction (Ariyoshi et al., 1996; Gomes et al., 1999; Popper et al., 2000; Damond et al., 2001; Soares et al., 2006; Gueudin et al., 2008; Bertine et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-1733	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3398	Cell Wall Compositional Analysis of Rice Culms	Xylan, Pectin, Cellulose, Acetylation, Cell wall, Rice Background The plant cell wall represents one of the most complicated cellular structure in nature and is essential for plant growth and adaptations to environments. Besides presenting multiple polysaccharide components and phenolic compounds, acetylation is a prevalent modification on most cell-wall polymers, which alters the physicochemical properties and increases the complexity of cell wall structure. Establishment of the effective analytic platform for cell wall composition is always a challenging task. The previous analytic method often uses alkali to extract cell wall residues, but removes acetate. Recent works have revealed that acetate patterns on xylan determine the folding of this polymer and impact the binding to cellulose or lignin, indicating its importance in cell wall formation and plant growth control (Grantham et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). The method that can simultaneously examine the composition of diverse cell-wall polysaccharides and their acetyl modifications needs to be developed. It becomes realizable as solvent dimethyl sulfoxide has been found extracting xylan without trimming acetyl esters (Goncalves et al., 2008). Rice culms are representative for cell wall composition methodology analysis because this organ is rich of secondary wall-bearing fiber cells and also contains multiple cell types. In addition to abundant materials, acetylation level varies on different wall polymers and during the culm development. By using rice culms as analytic samples, we developed a protocol for cell wall composition and acetyl modification analyses with some changes from the previous method (Foster et al., 2010). This protocol offers a widely used way to examine the composition of diverse cell wall polymers and determine the acetate content in

One to five percent of AD cases are familial and all the other cases are late-onset also known as sporadic AD. The understanding of sporadic AD has progressed substantially from studies using an AD animal model created by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (Mayer et al., 1990; Lannert and Hoyer, 1998).
Bio-protocol-1735	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3396	Immunofluorescence-based Determination of Centrosome Number in Tissue Samples	Centrosome, FFPE, Cancer, Tissue, High resolution immunofluorescent microscopy Background The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in cells and is crucial in defining mitotic spindle poles and forming cilia (Conduit et al., 2015). A centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles that serve as the duplicating elements of the centrosome and organize surrounding layers of pericentriolar material (PCM), a protein matrix with microtubule-nucleating activity (Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007; Lawo et al., 2012). Centrosome numerical abnormalities, especially centrosome amplification, have been reported to be commonly present in a variety of human tumors and are correlated with advanced tumor grade, metastasis, recurrence, and poor survival (Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011; Chan, 2011; Godinho and Pellman, 2014; Gonczy, 2015). Furthermore, centrosome numbers display both inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity in a broad range of tumors (Chan, 2011). Thus, a method to accurately quantify centrosome numbers on a single cell level in human tissue sample is useful to identify cancer cells with centrosome amplification, to study tumor heterogeneity, and to identify patients that might benefit from therapies that target cells with centrosome amplification.

Among those behaviors, sociability  is  defined  as  the  tendency  to  seek  out  social  interaction  (Caldwell,  2012).  Some neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) display a marked alteration in sociability combined with other features (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This characteristic highlights the need for experimental behavioral settings in animal models to address the research on such complex multi-facetted disorders (Caldwell, 2012). Mus musculus is a social specie showing reciprocal social interactions, sexual and parenting behaviors, territorial scent marking and aggressive behaviors (Ricceri et al., 2007; Silverman et al., 2010). The wide repertoire of mouse behaviors makes this specie suitable for modeling human disorders characterized by disruptions in social recognition and social behavior (Crawley, 2004; Yang et al., 2007). Such rodent models warrant the evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches for treatment (Moy et al., 2004). Commonly, mice conserve a characteristic pattern of social behavior, initiating social contact and approach when exposed to an unfamiliar conspecific (Moy et al., 2004).
Bio-protocol-1739	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3392	Reconstituting Breast Tissue with Organotypic Three-dimensional Co-culture of Epithelial and Stromal Cells in Discontinuous Extracellular Matrices	ECM, Organotypic 3D co-culture, Glandular epithelia, Mammary gland, Cell culture stamp Background Three-dimensional (3D) co-culturing of cells in the extracellular matrix (ECM) substratum allows for the reconstruction of the in vivo-like tissue architecture and behavior, as well as the analysis of cellular interactions within the tissue microenvironment (Langhans, 2018). Furthermore, the advent of synthetic ECM materials and micropatterning techniques in the 2000s has enabled the regeneration of optimal ECM composition and spatial orientation for each tissue type in co-culture (Hotary et al., 2000; Gudjonsson et al., 2002; Carey et al., 2017). In these 3D co-culture systems, fibroblasts form a layer of the connective tissue while epithelial cells grow on top of the connective tissue or on the plastic surfaces exposed by micropatterning the ECM ( Stark et al., 2004; Kalabis et al., 2012; March et al., 2015). This method enables the reconstruction of 3D architecture of surface (stratified) epithelia, such as skin and esophagus. Such 3D co-culture technique has been utilized in generation of the transplantable skin organoids (Kim et al., 2018), disease modeling (e.g., psoriasis, esophagitis) and drug screening (Klicks et al., 2017; Whelan et al., 2018; Sarkiri et al., 2019). On the other hand, this technique is not suitable for the reconstruction of glandular epithelia that have more intricate ECM organizations. The glandular epithelium is enclosed by the basement membrane, which is, in turn, embedded in the connective tissue encompassing fibroblasts and other stromal cells.

Reitzel and Andrew W. Truman*	Hsp70, Molecular chaperones, Nematostella, Plasmid swap Background Hsp70 is a molecular chaperone that plays a role in protein folding of newly synthesized and misfolded proteins (Rosenzweig et al., 2019). It also controls the activity of regulatory proteins that contribute to cell cycle progression, protein degradation, apoptosis and resistance to anticancer therapeutics. Hsp70 is highly conserved throughout nature and is essential for cell viability. Organisms can express several highly similar Hsp70 isoforms. For example, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses 4 cytosolic isoforms, Ssa1-4 (Lotz et al., 2019). In order to characterize Hsp70 function, we can express different Hsp70 isoforms, paralogs, point mutations and truncations as the sole cytosolic Hsp70 protein in S. cerevisiae using a 5-FOA plasmid swap strategy (Boeke et al.,1987).
Bio-protocol-1743	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3388	Experimental Setup for a Diffusion Bioreactor to Isolate Unculturable Soil Bacteria	Diffusion bioreactor, Unculturable bacteria, Microbial ecology, Cultivation technique, Soil Background The metagenomic analysis has shown an overwhelming number of bacterial populations which are beyond the cultivation in the normal laboratory conditions (Gans et al., 2005; Pham and Kim, 2012). These bacteria which are not-yet cultured and not able to grow on synthetic media are known as unculturable bacteria. The “unculturable” does not imply that these bacteria can never be cultured, but instead, it indicates the absence of information on their natural habitat and growth requirements (Stewart, 2012; Chaudhary et al., 2019). The molecular analysis has reported that uncultured bacteria possess novel biological and chemical properties, produce secondary metabolites, and comprise a diverse functional role (Ferrari et al., 2005; Vartoukian et al., 2010; van Dorst et al., 2016). The secondary metabolites such as novel antibiotics, enzymes, toxins, alkaloids have potential use for human welfares. Due to these beneficial aspects, several studies have attempted to explore and cultivate the hidden uncultured bacteria from the environments (Sait et al., 2002; Ferrari et al., 2005; Davis et al., 2005; George et al., 2011; van Dorst et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-1745	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3386	3D Organoid Formation from the Murine Salivary Gland Cell Line SIMS	Salivary gland, Epithelial, SIMS, Differentiation assay, Mouse cell line Background In vitro differentiation assays are a remarkable tool that enables us to analyze the potency of cells without relying on in vivo models. Cells in these assays can be manipulated for gene expression to, for instance, analyze their differentiation ability. While previous protocols have described the differentiation potential of primary salivary gland cells in vitro, our protocol is optimized for the use of the SIMS cell line (Laoide et al., 1996; Maimets et al., 2016). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found in vivo to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure et al., 2015; Song et al. 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells in vivo, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific in vitro controlled conditions. Our recent work shows that SIMS cells have the ability to differentiate into unique populations of acinar, myoepithelial, and duct cells in 3D differentiation conditions, that normally produce, modify and secrete saliva in vivo (Lombaert et al., 2011; Athwal et al., 2019). This protocol describes the workflow necessary for the generation and analysis of 3D differentiated SIMS cells. SIMS cells are cultured in a 3D matrigel/collagen matrix over a period of 7-9 days. Matrigel is a solubilized basement membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, which is rich in several growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin-1, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans (Patel et al., 2016). Matrigel has been shown to induce differentiation of stem/progenitor cells and outgrowth of already differentiated cell types by causing polarization of cells embedded in or on top of it. For SIMS grown in this 3D matrix, organoid formation post single cell culture is apparent around day 5 of culture. These organoids are also stained either via cryosectioning or in 3D to analyze for differentiation markers and cell populations. Alterations, such as cell transfections, transductions and/or media changes, to this condition can easily be made to address specific research questions (Athwal et al., 2019). The media components were adjusted using literature from both existing salivary and mammary gland differentiation protocols, which deemed necessary to induce differentiation of the SIMS cells in vitro. Here we show the robust use of this cell line to address specific research questions without having to rely on primary salivary gland cells.

Bio-protocol-1749	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3382	ATAC-seq on Sorted Adult Mouse Neurons	ATAC, Neuron, Chromatin, Tn5, Transposase Background The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin coupled with next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming a widely used method to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility (Buenrostro et al., 2013; Corces et al., 2017). A major advantage of ATAC-seq over older methods such as DNase I hypersensitivity mapping, is that it can produce high-quality data from significantly smaller input. This allows chromatin and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to be explored in previously inaccessible populations of rare or sparse cell types. This is particularly useful in the nervous system where cellular diversity is incredibly high and cells of interest are post-mitotic and often sparse. While single cell methods play an important role in identifying heterogeneity and defining certain characteristics of cell types, they are often not suitable for deeper, reproducible characterization, or targeted manipulation and comparison of cell types. The growing number of marker genes and other genetic strategies to label restricted neuronal populations (Shima et al., 2016) is increasing the depth and breadth of molecular and biochemical assays, including ATAC-seq, used to study diverse types of neurons. However, isolation of healthy, high-quality neurons from live tissue requires special considerations. Here we adapt an earlier protocol for isolating neurons from live, adult brain tissue (Hempel et al., 2007) to generate ATAC-seq profiles from sorted populations of 20,000-50,000 cells expressing a fluorescent marker. We successfully used this method to generate ATAC-seq profiles from a diverse range of adult neuronal types (Sugino et al., 2019).

Bio-protocol-1757	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3374	Using indCAPS to Detect CRISPR/Cas9 Induced Mutations	CRISPR, Restriction digest, PCR, CAPS, dCAPS, indCAPS Background Detecting mutations in biological samples is a common task in biological research. This is often performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, where a sample’s genotype at one locus is determined by examining the size or sequence of amplified DNA. This protocol is a practical guide  to  using  the  indCAPS  tool  (Hodgens  et  al.,  2017)  available  at http://indcaps.kieber.cloudapps.unc.edu/ to generate primers for PCR-based genotyping tasks. The indCAPS tool relies on a pair of techniques known as Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPS) and derived CAPS (dCAPS) (Neff et al., 1998), in which the genotype of a biological sample is determined by amplifying a region of DNA and assaying a diagnostic restriction site with a restriction enzyme. In a CAPS assay, the mutation of interest disrupts a known restriction site or creates a restriction site where one did not exist. In a dCAPS assay, a diagnostic site is created by introducing an intentional mismatch to one of the primers used to amplify the DNA, creating a restriction site in one genotype but not the other. Tools for generating primers for CAPS and dCAPS assays have been developed (Neff et al., 1998 and 2002) but are not compatible with insertion/deletion (indel) alleles such as those commonly acquired through CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis (Hodgens et al., 2017). With the recent rise of indel alleles in the literature due to CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, a tool capable of generating dCAPS primers for indel alleles would make genotyping tasks easier. The indCAPS tool was developed to provide a tool for generating CAPS and dCAPS primers compatible with indels (Hodgens et al., 2017) and is intended to be easy to use and interpret for biologists designing genotyping assays.

Therefore, to preserve normal cellular function, oxygen levels need to be maintained within a relatively narrow ‘normoxic’ range. This applies both to cells in vivo and to cell lines used in cell culture (Hunyor and Cook, 2018).
Bio-protocol-1761	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3370	A PhoA-STII Based Method for Efficient Extracellular Secretion and Purification of Fab from Escherichia coli	Fab, PhoA, STII, Extracellular production, Secretion Background Due to its clear genetic background, easy manipulation, and cost-effective production, E. coli is widely employed for exogenous gene expression, especially those of lower molecular weight and simpler conformational structures (Gupta and Shukla, 2017). The expression of foreign proteins in E. coli is mainly divided into three categories, inclusion bodies expression, intracellular soluble expression in periplasmic space, and extracellular secretion into medium (Jalalirad, 2013; Gupta and Shukla, 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). At present, most of mammalian-sourced foreign proteins are expressed in E. coli intracellular region, either in the form of inclusion bodies or soluble. But both forms have their respective disadvantages for subsequent processes. The inclusion bodies need to be tediously denatured and renatured to recover the target proteins with correct refolded structures, and the processes tend to cause reduction in the biological activity and yield (Panda et al., 2003; Nelson and Reichert, 2009). The periplasmic space of E. coli can provide an oxidative environment conducive to the formation of disulfide bonds, but the yield is usually limited by the capacity of the periplasmic space as Copyright  2019 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.
Bio-protocol-1762	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3369	Quantitation of TLR4 Internalization in Response to LPS in Thioglycollate Elicited Peritoneal Mouse Macrophages by Flow Cytometry	TLR4, LPS, TRIF, CD14, Endocytosis, Peritoneal macrophages Background Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is unique among the Toll-like receptors in that it can deliver qualitatively different signals from two distinct cellular locations (reviewed in Takeda and Akira, 2004). Cell surface TLR4/MD2 is initially ligated by extracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and engages the intracellular adaptor MAL and MyD88. Subsequently a fraction of cell surface LPS bound TLR4/MD2 will undergo CD14 and clathrin dependent internalization and translocation to an early endosomal compartment (Zanoni et al., 2011). In this endosomal compartment TLR4, engages the signaling adaptors TRAM and TRIF. Much of the regulation of TLR4 internalization and transport remains to be discovered. A flow cytometric method for quantifying loss of TLR4 surface expression, as a metric for endosomal translocation was first described in Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) by Jonathan Kagan and colleagues (Kagan et al., 2008). Here we describe a modified version of this protocol to enable quantitation of TLR4 internalization in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages on which we have published (Rajaiah et al., 2015; Perkins et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-1765	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3366	Production of Quantum Dots-containing Influenza Virus Particles	Influenza A virus, vRNP, Quantum dots, Viral assembly, Uncoating Background Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most important human pathogens. Viral entry before virus-endosome fusion has been widely studied by various methods, including single-particle tracking. However, the viral uncoating process following endocytosis remains elusive. Robust live imaging strategies that offer high temporal and spatial resolution are essential to study this dynamic and transient event. However, the influenza RNA genome is intolerant to insertion of large genetic materials, and rescue of viruses using fluorescent protein fused to viral genomic core proteins have been limited (Lakdawala et al., 2014). This has delayed progress in the field of influenza-uncoating and vRNPsdynamics live-imaging studies. Although purified vRNPs have been dye-labeled and microinjected into cells to track their intracellular transportation and nuclear import process in living cells in real time (Babcock et al., 2004), this method cannot capture the real infection process of incoming virions or determine  vRNP  behaviors  during  uncoating.  Fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH)  and colocalization analyses with single-molecule resolution have also been used to study the behavior of vRNPs in infected cells (Chou et al., 2013), but the fixation procedures are not compatible with imaging vRNP dynamics in living cells. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have unique optical properties, such as remarkable brightness and superior photostability, and are well-suited to single-particle tracking of viral infection. Single-particle tracking of virions with QDs-labeled genetic material provides an opportunity for tracking viral uncoating and post-uncoating genetic behaviors in real time. As a subunit of polymerase complex, PA protein participates in the composition of vRNP-genetic core of IAV. In PNAS, Qin et al. (2019) developed a nanotechnology that labels IAV viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) with QDs. Briefly, the biotin acceptor peptide (AP tag) was genetically fused to the PA protein to construct a recombinant PR8 strain. The rescued rPR8-PA-AP virus was then cultured in BirA-expressing MDCK cells in the presence of biotin. Streptavidin-coated QDs (SA-QDs) were introduced into these cells by lipofection to allow noncovalent binding of the QDs to biotinylated PA. QDs-containing influenza virus particles were thus generated. This approach will advance the mechanistic understanding of influenza virus uncoating using live fluorescence microscopy.

Additionally, treatments for these injuries have not much changed in the last 100 years (Mundie, 1920; Taylor et al., 2008). As such, models of PNI have become important to understand potential barriers to regeneration and treatments for enhancing it. While in humans and larger mammals, such as cats, suturing through the epineurium is a common mechanism of repair (Lundborg, 2002; Grinsell and Keating, 2014; Raslan et al., 2014), this treatment is not reliably performed in mice. First, the diameter of the sciatic nerve is less than 2 mm making the placement of epineurial sutures technically challenging. Second, in comparison to nerves in larger animals, axons in mouse nerves are more likely to exude from cut nerves or “mushroom out” when the epineurium is penetrated during placement of sutures, making clean repair of the cut nerves difficult. Finally, placement of sutures in small rodents can interfere with the blood supply of regenerating nerves. One method that can overcome these challenges is the use of fibrin glue, a tool that  was first  utilized  in human patients (Egloff  and Narkas, 1983; MacGillivray, 2003). The implementation of fibrin glue in experimental animals (as models to assess its benefits for human nerve repair) also has a long history; decades ago it was found to be as effective as epineurial sutures for repair of the rat sciatic nerve (Nishihira, 1988). We describe a method to repair a mouse sciatic nerve injury that facilitates nerve regeneration in experimental situations. First, we use a fibrin glue formula, derived from human and bovine blood components, that was previously found to enhance repair in central nervous system axon tracts (Guest et al., 1997). Second, we secure the nerve by adhering it to a silastic mat prior to transection. This ensures a minimal gap between the proximal and distal nerve stumps and enhanced stability, without having to leave a piece of the epineurium intact, which is a technically difficult approach and can result in leaving some axons uninjured. The improved coaptation and increased stability diminishes the incidence of dehiscence reported without suture stabilization (Cruz et al., 1986). While the components of fibrin glue may interact with the immune system (Schoenecker et al., 2001; Mosesson, 2005; Kelsh et al., 2014), this strategy has been used extensively in both rats and mice with great success. Comprehensive comparisons of nerve repair efficiency using fibrin glues compared to epineurial sutures have been recently published (Adel et al., 2017; Koulaxouzidis et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018). In our hands, the protocol described facilitates sciatic nerve reformation in mice by two months following injury as quantified by complete motor muscle reinnervation assessed by re-occupancy of neuromuscular junctions and electromyography with an almost 100% success rate (Wilhelm et al., 2012; Rotterman et al., 2019). As a further advantage, drugs or other compounds can be added to the glue to test how different factors administered peripherally (and directly on the nerve) may impact regeneration (Wilhelm et al., 2012). These nerve repair surgeries are all done in adult ( ^3+ month) C57Blk/6 mice, but can easily be transferred to other species and ages.

Respiration inhibitors may be considered for use as antifungals, as they can limit growth, promote cell death and in some cases act in co-operation with current antifungals such as fluconazole (Vincent et al., 2016). Therefore, characterization of C. albicans respiration in response to different environments, nutrients and inhibitors is important to understand pathogenicity and may also prove useful for future drug development.

Although other sequences are also likely to be targeted by heparanase (Peterson and Liu, 2013), substrate specificity studies indicate that heparanase preferably cleaves the +1-to4 -inter-glycosidic bond between a glucuronic acid (GlcA) and glucosamine-N,6-disulfate (GlcNS6S) residues.

Death typically occurs 2-3 years post-symptom onset, due to a lack of effective therapies. Although death of motor neurons is a key feature of ALS, the disease is non-cell autonomous with neighboring cells such as astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes playing a key role (Ferraiuolo et al., 2011b; Ferraiuolo et al., 2016; Frakes et al., 2017; Vandoorne et al., 2018). Astrocytes play a crucial metabolic role in the CNS as they are the major source of brain glycogen, and astrocyte lactate can be taken up by motor neurons and used as a source of energy (Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994). Several mechanisms have been implicated in astrocyte-mediated motor neuron death, including release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2, altered glutamate transporter expression, reduced lactate release and reduced extracellular vesicle mediated release of miRNA (Lin et al., 1998; Ferraiuolo et al., 2011a; Ferraiuolo et al., 2011b; Allen et al., 2019; Varcianna et al., 2019).

The human brain also contains a high white matter content, which is suggested to account for higher brain functions, such as social and cognitive learning (Maldonado and Angulo, 2015; Almeida and Lyons, 2016; Kougioumtzidou et al., 2017). Single cell expression studies in animals indicate that oligodendrocytes form heterogeneous populations of cells (Marques et al., 2016). This supports the notion that oligodendrocytes fulfill more complex functions than solely isolating axons. As the human comprises of higher diversity of neurons compared to rodent brain, and considering the role of white matter in complex functions in learning and cognition, we could expect an even more complex diversity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the human brain. Therefore, we need to identify oligodendrocyte-neuron crosstalk in the human brain. Next to the classic white matter disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and the leukodystrophies (van der Knaap and Bugiani, 2017), white matter abnormalities are consistently been found in psychiatric disorders (Haroutunian  et  al.,  2014).  Increasing  evidence  shows  that  crosstalk  between  neurons  and oligodendrocytes is important for proper neural network functioning (Bergles et al., 2000; Velez-Fort et al.,  2010;  Maldonado  and  Angulo,  2015)  and  myelin  formation  (Almeida  and  Lyons,  2016; Kougioumtzidou  et  al., 2017). Therefore, to study  the involvement of neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions in the normal and diseased brains, we are in need of human-based model systems. As current assays mostly involve non-human cells (Cui et al., 2010; Hill et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2017; Pang et al., 2018; Treichel and Hines, 2018), we developed human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based co-culture models to study crosstalk between human neurons and human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). The presented co-culture method was used to study neuron-OPC interactions in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) (Nadadhur et al., 2019), a genetic multisystem disorder that shows both grey and white matter abnormalities in the brain. Although some neuronal abnormalities were present in mono-cultures of TSC neurons, in the presence of OPCs increased axonal density and hypertrophy became apparent (Nadadhur et al., 2019). This suggests that specific neuronal phenotypes can only be studied when oligodendrocytes are present. Vice versa oligodendrocyte maturation is highly dependent on neuronal signaling. Therefore these culture systems can be applied to study multiple processes in health and disease in which complex neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions are involved, and provide prospects for the development of drug screening platforms for all-human cells, e.g., patient iPSCs. To conclude, this novel human neuron-OPC co-culture model can be used to study neuron-OPC crosstalk in health and disease.

Approaches to induce gene expression have typically relied on the use of transgenic animal models (Ericsson et al., 2013) and viral overexpression vectors (Prelich, 2012). These techniques are resource and time-consuming to make, neglect the endogenous gene locus, are limited by viral cargo capacities, and generally only target one gene at a time. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has been adapted to recruit effector proteins, such as transcriptional activators, to enable precise control over transcription (Chavez et al., 2015; Savell and Day, 2017). We recently optimized a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for robust, specific, titratable, and multiplexable gene induction in neurons both in vitro and in vivo by adapting available CRISPRa tools to be expressed with a dual lentivirus approach (Savell et al., 2019). This dual lentivirus system is composed of lentiviruses containing a gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) and the dCas9-VPR (a strong transcriptional activator). Multiplexing at a single gene involves recruiting multiple dCas9-VPR effectors to a single gene’s promoter to boost transcription of that gene by pooling sgRNAs targeting the same gene. Multiplexing multiple genes is possible through combining sgRNAs targeting each of the desired genes.

Expression of ERV families is tissue-specific (Faulkner et al., 2009), and many families of ERV are temporally and differentially regulated throughout embryogenesis (Peaston et al., 2004; Rowe and Trono, 2011). We observed that proviral ERV are globally dysregulated in C57BL/6N, but not C57BL/6J, mice, secondary to loss of two transcriptional repressors, suppressor of non-ecotropic ERV (SNERV)-1, and SNERV-2, that promote heterochromatinization at ERV loci (Treger et al., 2019). We observed that in the absence of SNERVs in C57BL/6N mice, ERV are upregulated in a variety of immune cells, as well as in murine embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells. To identify whether ERV dysregulation is similarly present in gametes, we needed a cost-effective method to successfully generate cDNA sequencing libraries from pooled samples of growing oocytes.

The cochlea is an organ in the inner ear that transduces mechanical stimulation into electronic signals. As a result, generated auditory information is transferred to the brain. Hair cells (HCs) in the organ of Corti, an auditory sensory epithelium, are protected by the temporal bone and are precisely disposed to detect every frequency band from the base (high pitch) to the apex (low pitch) (von Békésy, 1990). Functional analysis of the cochlea is limited due to its anatomical specificity. Surface preparation and sectioning (paraffin or frozen sections) are the most popular methods in histological analysis; however, these techniques do not preserve the three-dimensional structure (Fujimoto et al., 2017; Mizushima et al., 2017). To better understand the processing of auditory information, the location and diversity of HCs must be accurately determined. Consequently, a novel technique to identify intact HCs has long been sought. Established optical clearing methods such as CLARITY, 3DISCO, Sca/eS, iDISCO, and CUBIC (Dodt et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2013; Renier et al., 2014; Susaki et al., 2014; Hama et al., 2015) enable imaging of intact brains and other organs, but are not optimized for imaging of all HCs (Urata et al., 2019). Based on recently developed optical clearing methods for hard tissues such as vDISCO, Bone CLARITY, PEGASOS, CUBIC-X, PACT, and PARS (Calve et al., 2015; Treweek et al., 2015; Berke et al., 2016; Greenbaum et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018; Jing et al., 2018; Tainaka et al., 2018), we present a sorbitol-based optical clearing method (modified Sca/eS) that is optimized for intact imaging of all mouse HCs in the cochlea (Urata et al., 2019).

In this test, the mouse is placed in a glass cylinder and the number of times it rears up and touches the cylinder wall is measured. The wall touches are subsequently scored for the left, right, or both paws by an observer in slow motion recorded videos. The results are expressed as the percentage of each paw usage relative to the total number of touches.

PCs are serine endoprotease family enzymes that are known to cleave various growth factors including Epidermal growth factor (EGF), the Transforming Growth Factor beta/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (TGF-β/BMP) family, several Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family proteins, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), all of which play a critical role in development and diseases (Khatib and Geraldine, 2006; Tulin and Stathopoulos, 2010; Rousselet et al., 2011; Künnapuu et al., 2014; Constam, 2014; Anderson and Wharton, 2017; Sohr et al., 2019). Although biochemical and cell culture assays are sufficient to demonstrate a substrate cleavage by individual PC substrate-specificity, their functional characterization in vivo is largely dependent on classical genetic approaches. However, the presence of multiple PCs in different organisms and their functional redundancy can only provide limited information about an individual PC's function. There are nine PCs in vertebrates and three in Drosophila, all expressed broadly, that share a consensus cleavage site (-Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg-) in their substrates.

The conventional techniques such as RNAi-based methods lack cellular specificity and efficiency. On the other hand, recently developed gene editing techniques using the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows researchers efficient gene disruption in a cell type-specific manner. A research group led by Feng Zhang showed the disruption of multiple genes in the adult mouse brain by AAV-mediated delivery of sgRNA (Swiech et al., 2015). Also, the group established cre-dependent spCas9 knockin mice (Platt et al., 2014). In a recent study, we used an AAV vector carrying dual sgRNA to improve the efficiency of biallelic gene targeting (Yamaguchi et al., 2018). We here describe a protocol for the construction of dual sgRNA AAV vector (Figure 1).
Bio-protocol-1798	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3333	Fibroblast Gap-closure Assay-Microscopy-based in vitro Assay Measuring	Fibroblast, Migration, Fibrosis, Gap closure, Chemotaxis Background Few treatments for fibrosing diseases exist because of an incompletely understood and complex etiology (Rockey et al., 2015). Current efforts to develop therapies for organ fibrosis have focused on pathologic fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts (Blackwell et al., 2014). In addition to secretion of matrix proteins such as collagen, which comprise scar, a hallmark of pathologic fibroblasts is their increased proliferative and migratory capacity (Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick, 2014). A number of studies have shown that innate immune cells interact with and mediate fibroblast activation (Desai et al., 2018). Thus, we investigated the effects of lung macrophages on fibroblasts in a recent study, where we found a novel population of macrophages that localizes to fibrotic scar in murine lung (Aran et al., 2019). These macrophages highly expressed PDGF-AA, a secreted factor known for promoting fibroblast migration and proliferation. Thus, we treated mouse 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts with conditioned media from cultured mouse lung macrophages, with and without PDGF-AA blocking antibody, and measured fibroblast gap closure.
Bio-protocol-1799	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3332	A Radioactive in vitro ERK3 Kinase Assay	ERK3, MAPK, Kinase assay, Radioactive assay, ^32P. -ATP Background Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Coulombe and Meloche, 2007). Here we describe an in vitro kinase assay in which ERK3 transfers radiolabeled gamma-phosphate from γ- ^32P -ATP to a purified protein substrate. Excess radiolabeled ATP is then separated from the radiolabeled substrate by gel electrophoresis. The amount of phosphorylated substrate can be quantified by autoradiography, phosphorimaging, or liquid scintillation counting techniques. Radioactive kinase assay provides a direct measurement of kinase activity. It is sensitive, quick, inexpensive, and considered as the 'gold standard' for quantification of protein kinase activity. The major limitations of radioactive kinase assays are the hazards of handling radiolabeled isotopes and unsuitability of this assay format for large scale high-throughput screening.

Oxygen is a changing environmental parameter. Levels change in different tissues and during different stages of infection and immune activation (Carreau et al., 2011; Wenger et al., 2015). The ability to sustain growth and to survive in low oxygen environments has been linked to virulence in several fungi (Shepardson et al., 2013; Gresnigt et al., 2016; Pradhan et al., 2018). We have developed a protocol to follow the generation of hypoxia in a mouse infected with C. albicans (Lopes et al., 2018). We chose subdermal infection as a local, non-disseminated model of mycosis with acute onset which allows analysis of hypoxia in a confined space, where C. albicans and host cells interact (Urban et al., 2009; Santus et al., 2018). Thereby, natural variation of oxygen levels in other tissues can be eliminated and secondary effects from distant locations arising in systemic infection can be avoided. During infection, hypoxia is created mainly by neutrophil influx to the site of infection. Neutrophil extravasation and the activation of oxygen-consuming enzymes create environments with low oxygen levels. In turn, C. albicans exploits this environmental shift to avoid immune recognition by changing cell wall composition leading to masking of recognized entities (Lopes et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-1818	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3313	Isolation and Culture of Single Myofiber and Immunostaining of Satellite Cells from Adult C57BL/6J Mice	Myofiber isolation and culture, Muscle satellite cells, Immunofluorescence staining Background Satellite cells are considered as an adult stem cell because they maintain self-renew and remarkable postnatal regenerative potential of skeletal muscle (Collins et al., 2005). SCs are located between the basal lamina and the plasma lemma of myofibers (MAURO, 1961). Here, to isolate the single myofiber, EDL muscle is digested with the collagenase to release the connective tissue and completely dissociate the connective tissue between fibers. In 1986, it was reported that the proliferation of satellite cells on single muscle fibers were isolated from adult rats and were cultured in cell culture plate (Bischoff, 1986). It was further developed into a tissue culture system that reliably permits isolation of intact, living, single muscle fibers with associated satellite cells from predominantly fast- and slowtwitch muscles of rat or mouse (Bekoff and Betz, 1977a and 1977b; Rosenblatt et al., 1995). There are two main approaches to study SCs: single myofiber culture and primary myoblast culture prepared from mononucleated cells dissociated from whole muscle (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012). Even though, primary myoblast could be split and passaged multiple times, these primary myoblasts retain in proliferation or differentiation states. Freshly isolated single myofiber allows satellite cells to stay beneath the basal lamina at quiescent state, followed with activation by either internal environment or external factors. There are several improvements for myofiber isolation and culture in recent years (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012; Pasut et al., 2013; Gallot et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2018). However, the difficulty of myofiber isolation and ex vivo culture prevent further application of this reliable and practical method. In the current protocol, we optimized reagents used for single myofiber isolation and improved procedures to make it even more simple and easy to repeat from hand to hand. Since satellite cells are sensitive to various factors, we describe a relatively simple, detailed and efficient approach to isolate and culture single myofiber. Based on our protocol, state and function of satellite cells could be analyzed from mice with different genotypes. Different manipulation such as transfection, and drug treatment on myofibers, followed with the downstream procedures including but not limited to myofiber transplantation and immunostaining could be performed. These additional manipulations could not be performed in these approaches such as FASC or cryosection.

Their processes, both dendrites and axons, need to be able to respond to changes in the microenvironment in a manner independent of the soma (Holt and Schuman, 2013). To fully understand neuron biology, it is therefore important to be able to study neurites in isolation, in addition to conducting analysis of the cell bodies. This appears particularly important for neurons where the axon and dendrites constitute the majority of the cellular volume, as is the case for spinal motor neurons where we estimate that they comprise approximately 99% of the cellular volume. To isolate neurites, there are excellent tools such as Campenot Chambers (Boyden, 1962; Campenot, 1977) or microfluidic chambers (Taylor et al., 2005).

Therefore, in the light dark task, rodents often spend more time in the dark compartment (Champagne et al., 2010; Hascoet et al., 2001). Alteration of this natural scototaxic response allows researchers to investigate the anxiogenic and anxiolytic properties of certain pharmacological agents (Sousa et al., 2006; Hascoet et al., 2001). While this paradigm has recently been adapted for use in zebrafish, the transference of this task from rodents to zebrafish has resulted in a number of inconsistencies. Unlike the nocturnal rodent, zebrafish are diurnal which may pose an issue for generalizing scototaxic and phototaxic responses across these species.

Balint-Kurti1, 5 *	Maize, Corn, Sorghum, MAMP, PAMP, ROS Background In plants, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plasma membrane recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs). MAMPs are molecules that are generally highly conserved among large groups of microbes and are not directly associated with pathogenesis (Segonzac and Zipfel, 2011). The most widely studied MAMP is flg22, a 22-amino acid epitope of bacterial flagellin (Zipfel et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2013). Chitin, a component of the fungal cell wall, has also been studied extensively (Newman et al., 2013). MAMP recognition by PRRs leads to a defense response termed the MAMP response or the MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) response. The MAMP response can include phenomena such as cell wall reinforcement by callose and lignin deposition, changes in ion flux across the plasma membrane, changes in phytohormone concentrations, induction or repression of plant defense-related genes, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) (Thomma et al., 2011). Several methods have been used to measure the MAMP response, these include measurement of: ROS production, NO production, growth inhibition, gene expression, MAP Kinase phosphorylation, callose deposition and lignification, seedling growth inhibition, and induced disease resistance (Vetter et al., 2012; Valdés-López et al., 2014; Lloyd et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).

Due to their localization in the airspace of the alveoli, AM are directly exposed to inhaled air and pathogens or other aerosolized particles. Consequently, AM play a crucial role in the initiation or suppression of inflammatory responses and are the subject of investigation in numerous studies that explore mechanisms of pulmonary diseases (Hodge et al., 2007; Sun and Metzger, 2008; Happle et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2014a; Machiels et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017). Interestingly, AM in the mouse originate from fetal monocytes and are able to selfmaintain their numbers in vivo without contribution of bone-marrow-derived monocytes under steady state conditions (Guilliams et al., 2013; Hashimoto et al., 2013). AM are unique in that they reside outside of the body surface and are directly exposed to the external environment. They can therefore be isolated with minimal tissue disturbance using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We previously demonstrated that the self-renewal property of AM harvested by BAL is maintained in culture by growing AM long-term in liquid media or serially re-plating AM in semi-solid media (Soucie et al., 2016; Imperatore et al., 2017). Here, we describe the methodological advancements in BAL and specific culturing conditions optimized for long-term culture and high AM yields.

The barley powdery mildew fungus B. graminis f. sp. hordei, is economically important, and one of the best studied powdery mildews (Both et al., 2005a; Bindschedler et al., 2009). This fungus is an obligate biotroph, which means it can only infect and propagate on living barley plants (Pedersen et al., 2012). Its asexual life cycle involves an intimate relationship with the host plant. Airborne conidia germinate on the host producing first a primary and then a secondary germ tube. The secondary germ tube develops an appressorium, from which a hyphal peg penetrates into an epidermal cell. Inside the cell, a penetration peg enlarges and forms a multidigitate feeding structure: the haustorium. This is surrounded by a plant-derived extrahaustorial membrane (Both et al., 2005b; Bindschedler et al., 2016).

It is a well-known model to study blood vessels and angiogenesis in the context of tumor biology (Kain et al., 2014; Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2014). The chick development in the egg lasts 21 days (Romanoff, 1960). Three days after starting incubating the eggs, we cut a small round window into the eggshell for easy access to the CAM later in the procedure (Figure 1). At this time point the membrane is not yet formed and thus there is no risk to damage it. On Day 7 of embryo development the tumor cells are seeded on the CAM and seven days later (Day 14) the microtumors that developed on the membrane are harvested and analyzed. To this end, the tumors are excised, fixed, dehydrated, embedded and cut to apply immunohistochemical stainings for the autophagy-related markers: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B, short LC3B) and sequestosome 1

During times of airway infection, high-velocity airflow (i.e., cough) represents an effective backup mechanism to clear accumulated mucus. However, abnormalities in mucus properties, which characterize several airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma, lead to a reduction in airflow-mediated cough clearance (Button et al., 2016).

Viral PAMPs, associated with virus invasion, include virus surface glycoproteins, viral DNA and RNAs (Mogensen and Paludan, 2005). In case of RNA virus infection, virus replication generated RNAs are essential PAMPs portion which is able to be recognized by the host intracellular PRRs (Alexopoulou et al., 2001). Two possible candidates for the role of such viral-generated PAMP RNAs have been recently reported. First, classical viral PAMP RNAs are dsRNA replication forms that are recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 and non-capped positive-strand RNAs (polyA+) generated by alphaviruses (Sokoloski et al., 2015) that may be recognized by RIG-I (Akhrymuk et al., 2015). Second, non-classical viral PAMP RNAs are short non-polyadenylated dsRNAs with 5’ triphosphate. They are IFN-inducing RNAs generated by viral replicase using cellular RNA templates (Nikonov et al., 2013). In Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infected cells these RNAs represent the majority of PAMP RNAs (Nikonov et al., 2013).

The development of cytogenetic techniques enables us to gain knowledge about spatial and temporal proceedings of a given protein in the whole cell (Fransz et al., 1998; De Paula and Techio, 2014). Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by affecting chromatin structure and function (Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011). Moreover, a number of studies indicated that pathways and patterns of epigenetic modification exhibit distinct properties in different species, including Arabidopsis, rice, and maize (Kim et al., 2009; Chen and Zhou, 2013; Capuano et al., 2014; Springer and Schmitz, 2017). Immunolocalization techniques benefit greatly to decipher the morphology and structure of chromosomes during each step of plant meiosis (Pawlowski et al., 2013). However, many proteins associated with chromatin are not expressed in tassels or ears during meiosis. Thus, somatic cells as materials were used to analyze the localization of proteins that are expressed in other plant tissues during mitosis. Analyzing the changes in those proteins and in epigenetic modifications between wild type and a mutant allows us to gain a deeper understanding in their functions. In summary, this method allows us to detect the spatial or temporal distribution of a given protein during mitosis, and identify the distribution of various epigenetic modifications attributing to the molecular function via mitotic chromosome spreads.

In contrast to a handful of well-studied modified bases that constitute the DNA epigenome, over a hundred modified ribonucleosides are present in all types of RNA. This diversity offers new possibilities to modulate gene expression, significantly expanding the metabolic and regulatory functions of RNA (Zhao et al., 2017). Mainly studied in abundant transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), ribonucleoside modifications have more recently  been  described  in  messenger  RNAs  (mRNAs),  where  they  form  the  basis  of  the epitranscriptome (Zhao et al., 2017). These epitranscriptomic modifications have the potential to control all steps of mRNA metabolism including structure, stability, location and translation.

It is a leading model system in these fields due to the organism’s well-characterized two apical flagella, inexpensive and simple culture conditions, and a fully sequenced haploid genome allowing for excellent genetic studies. Understanding the Chlamydomonas cytoskeleton will play an important role in advancing these areas of research. However, the filamentous actin network of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii remains uncharacterized, partly due to the difficulties in visualizing filaments in this eukaryotic alga.

Bio-protocol-1865	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3266	Rat Model of Empathy for Pain	Empathy, Prosocial behavior, Altruism, Pain, Rodent, Model Background Empathy for pain is referred to as an evolutionary behavior of social animals and humans associated with the ability to feel, recognize, understand and share the other's distressing (pain, social rejection and catastrophe) states (Chen, 2018). Impairment of empathy can definitely lead to deficits in social communication and sociability (attachment, bond, prosocial reciprocity, altruism and morality) that may be fundamental to some psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychopathy, misconduct, antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia (de Waal and Preston, 2017; Chen, 2018). In humans, empathy for pain has been demonstrated to be processed by a common core neural network mainly involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex which are also associated with direct feeling of emotional pain (Rainville et al., 1997; Singer et al., 2004; Lamm et al., 2011). Psychologically, empathy for pain can be expressed as changes in emotional state (feeling of pain, anxiety, etc.) and cognitive functions (attentional bias) of a subject who is witnessing distressing condition of others, especially his/her familiars (family members, kin, friends, colleagues, etc.), and this can subsequently motivate empathic concern, consolation and help in behavior (Darwin, 1871; Burkett et al., 2016; de Waal and Preston, 2017). Moreover, vicariously felt pain or social transfer of pain from a distressing object to a witnessing subject is frequently evidenced as empathic pain feeling (lowed pain threshold or enhanced pain sensitivity) in humans (Goubert et al., 2005; Williams and Rhudy, 2007; Loggia et al., 2008; Villemure and Bushnell, 2009; Godinho et al., 2012).

Kathiravan et al. (2015) developed a way of extracting total genomic DNA from samples of farmland. However, working with crude oil can be a little bit more problematic. The metagenomic DNA obtained must be purified, since humic acid contaminants and proteins have serious negative effects on the DNA polymerase (Wang et al., 2013). In the same way, hydrocarbon-contaminated soils present an even greater challenge. Because, in addition to the usual soil contaminants, traces of organic substances and heavy metals remain in the DNA extracts and reduce PCR amplification efficiency, by degrading or capturing nucleic acids, or by deactivating DNA polymerase (Fortin et al., 2004). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is used in order to detect genes involved in metabolic pathways of interest and obtain an analysis of soil microbial diversity. The PCR is a necessary study to remedy and restore oil contaminated soils through environmentally friendly biological technologies (Lozano-A et al., 2008).

The developing leaf blade, which is distal to the pre-ligular band or ligule, has three primary developmental zones. Proximal to the base or ligule are undifferentiated cells undergoing symmetric divisions, followed by differentiating cells undergoing asymmetric divisions, and finally cells that are no longer dividing but undergoing rapid cell expansion (Sylvester et al., 1996; Facette et al., 2013). This makes the monocot leaf an excellent model for studying cell division and aspects of leaf development. The developmental progression observed in monocot leaves has been used to study photosynthetic and vascular bundle formation in maize (Li et al., 2010); stomatal divisions in Brachypodium distachyon (Raissig et al., 2016), rice (Wu et al., 2019) and maize (Facette et al., 2015); and cell division in maize (Hunter et al., 2012; Nelissen et al., 2012). Maize leaves have large cells excellent for imaging these processes. Live cell imaging of the immature leaf using fluorescent markers is powerful (Rasmussen, 2016), however this requires that plants express transgenic markers, which can be limiting. We present a whole-mount procedure that does not require difficult and time-consuming sectioning, to observe the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in the developing maize leaf epidermis.

In Drosophila melanogaster, various paradigms have been developed to study habituation to visual, mechanical, gustatory, and olfactory stimuli. The variety of fly responses to odor stimulation led to development of different habituation paradigms, including olfactory jump response habituation (Mihalek et al., 1997; Asztalos et al., 2007a and 2007b; Joiner et al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2009), olfactory startle response habituation (Cho et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2007), unconditioned leg movement habituation (Chandra and Singh, 2005), and olfactory avoidance habituation (Das et al., 2011).

In both humans and mice, the absence of this enzyme results in the accumulation of one of its substrates, CD74 N-terminal fragment (CD74-NTF) in MHC class IIpositive cells (Beisner et al., 2013; Bergmann et al., 2013; Schneppenheim et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2018). This accumulated CD74-NTF is selectively toxic to B cells in mice (Beisner et al., 2013; Bergmann et al., 2013; Schneppenheim et al., 2013) and conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) in both humans C D1c^+ DCs) and mice (CD11c+CD11c+ DCs). We identified the cells most sensitive to CD74-NTF accumulation and gained insight into the mechanism of CD74-NTF-mediated cytotoxicity, using a specific chemical inhibitor of SPPL2a (L-685,458) (Huttl et al., 2015) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Epstein Barr virus-immortalized B cells (EBV-B) from healthy controls. We analyzed CD74-NTF accumulation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or western blotting (WB).

The dithiol/disulfide interconversion of a redox-active Cys pair, referred to as the redox regulation, is involved in a wide range of biological processes. In plant chloroplasts, this regulatory function seems to be strongly influenced by light conditions, because it is driven by a photosynthetically-generated reducing power (Buchanan, 1980). While the molecular machineries for supporting redox-regulatory system in chloroplasts, such as the thioredoxin (Trx), have been well identified so far (Buchanan et al., 2002; Lemaire et al., 2007; Jacquot, 2018), its working dynamics under environmental fluctuations remains poorly characterized. To address this issue, we need a methodology for analyzing the redox state of protein in vivo. To date, the spectrophotometric enzyme assay using a protein mixture extracted from intact chloroplasts or leaves has been often challenged on the assumption that the activation state of redox-regulated proteins is linked to their reduction level (Scheibe et al., 1989; Yoshida et al., 2007; Thormählen et al., 2015; Vaseghi et al., 2018). However, it is difficult from this assay to accurately estimate the redox state of the corresponding protein. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility of nonspecific redox change during sample preparations and/or enzyme assays. To overcome these problems, an alternative approach to discriminate the redox state of proteins in a direct way is highly desirable. Here, we provide a simple protocol for determining protein redox state in a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This method has allowed us to uncover dynamic redox behaviors of several chloroplast proteins under varying light conditions (Yoshida et al., 2014, 2015 and 2018; Yoshida and Hisabori, 2016a and 2018), underpinning high sensitivity and accuracy of this strategy. This method is also applicable to proteins located in other cellular compartments (Yoshida and Hisabori, 2016b).

Bio-protocol-1887	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3244	A Flow Cytometric Method to Determine Transfection Efficiency	Transfection, Flow cytometry, Nucleic acids, Protein expression, DNA labeling Background Transfection is one of the most commonly used techniques in molecular biology (Stoll and Calos, 2002; Kim and Eberwine, 2010). Transfection is the process of introducing nucleic acid (DNA that carries a gene of interest or mRNA) into target cells that then eventually express the desired nucleic acid or protein. There are several biological, chemical, and physical methods for introducing nucleic acids into cells (Stoll and Calos, 2002; Kim and Eberwine, 2010; Zhou et al., 2016). However, all these methods are variable and don’t assess the cell transfection efficiency, cell toxicity and the level of gene expression within the same experiment. To truly optimize cellular transfection, a sensitive and robust detection assay is required to quantify and optimize the efficiency of different transfection methods to deliver the target gene into the cytosol and facilitate protein expression, while reducing cell toxicity.

However its off-target activity causes DNA DSBs at imperfectly matched loci. During the past few years, several methods based on next-generation sequencing have been published to detect off-target sites. LAM-HTGTS (Frock et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016), which is based on chromosomal translocation, makes use of a “bait” DSB to capture “prey” DSBs to sensitively identify off-target hotspots; GUIDE-seq inserts a specific DNA oligo into break site and applies PCR to enrich DSBs (Tsai et al., 2015). In vitro methods such as Digenome-seq (Kim et al., 2015) and CIRCLEseq (Tsai et al., 2017) are more sensitive but often need to be verified in vivo. Though LAM-HTGTS is very sensitive, there is still room for improvement.

Bio-protocol-1905	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3226	Triple Fluorescence Anisotropy Reporter Imaging in Living Cells	Homotransfer, FRET, GFP, Anisotropy, Polarization, Imaging Background  The  timing  and  location  of  cell  signaling  activities  are  frequently  regulated. Genetically-encoded biosensors can reveal the dynamic nature of proteins and second messengers that transduce intracellular signals in living cells and organisms. There are several strategies available for engineering such reporters. Those that are based on FRET offer certain advantages, including design flexibility and a ratiometric readout that facilitates quantitative studies (Mehta and Zhang, 2011). Conventionally, two differently colored fluorescent proteins are incorporated into FRET biosensors (e.g., cyan/yellow or green/red). While effective, the two-color strategy leaves little room in the visible spectrum for multiplexing with other sensors or optical modulators. Recently, we have converted several FRET-based reporters to FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters, or FLAREs, that employ FRET pairs of the same color (Markwardt et al., 2018; Ross et al., 2018; Seckinger et al., 2018), thereby enabling measurement with several biosensors in the same specimen. Homotransfer FRET is measured by fluorescence polarization microscopy. This protocol describes the configuration of a widefield microscope for multiplexed FLARE imaging, sample preparation, experimentation and image analysis. Also, this protocol may be adapted for experiments with FLARE sensors co-imaged with other

From the early steps of PCa initiation, the associated stromal fibroblastic cells begin to co-evolve with cancer progression and are predictive of recurrent disease and survival (Ayala et al., 2003). Studying paracrine signaling from the epithelial cancer cells to the associated fibroblasts and vice versa is imperative to understand the complex interactions during all stages of cancer progression (Bhowmick et al., 2004; Placencio et al., 2008). 2D culture systems where conditioned media from one cell type is incubated with the target cell type as well as those utilizing Boyden chamber cultures enable the exchange of paracrine factors. However, the characteristics of the cells in collagen matrix have documented differences in their responses to hormones and growth factors (Ziaee and Chung, 2014; Naba et al., 2014). Utilizing a 3D co-culture system allows a more representative readout of paracrine interactions between the stroma and epithelia. This system can be adapted for multiple combinations of stromal fibroblasts and cancer epithelial cells. Combinations of mouse and human cells can be used to better differentiate the cell type from which the signals were derived/received. Furthermore, incubation in a hypoxic chamber can more closely model physiologic environments. We have used localized prostate cancer as an example for our studies.

Collagen structure is stabilized by several crosslinks which are found in small amounts in collagen where they are present in different types and varying ratios, depending on the tissue type. Alteration in crosslink types and amount results in several diseases such as bone fragility and skin hyperelasticity (Pinnell et al., 1972 and Arseni et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-1912	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3219	Northern Blot with IR Fluorescent Probes: Strategies for Probe Preparation	Northern blot, Near infrared, irNorthern, RNA detection, Non-radioactive Background Northern blot analysis is one of the foundational techniques available to biochemists and molecular biologists. While newer and more high-throughput techniques have been adopted, the Northern blot remains a powerful and adaptable method of analyzing RNA size and quantity simultaneously. In brief, DNA or RNA oligonucleotides labeled with radioactive phosphorus-32 (^32 P) are hybridized to a membrane crosslinked with RNA and subsequently detected using autoradiography (Alwine et al., 1977). Nonetheless, the use of ^32P is subject to institutional regulation, and safety precautions must be observed during its use (Jones, 2005). Additionally, ^32P probes have short lifespans increasing their cost for use. Alternative protocols using digoxigenin (DIG) conjugated to dNTP or NTP have been developed to replace ^32P (Seibl et al., 1990). While successful, DIG probes require secondary detection by antibodies, more hands-on time and expensive reagents, deterring its wider adoption. Our recently published method, irNorthern, is straightforward and adaptable. It utilizes IR dyes which reduce auto-fluorescent background (Zarnegar et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2018). These IR dyes are conjugated with a dibenzocyclooctyne group (DBCO), which forms a covalent bond with the azide on the probes through copper-free click chemistry. To demonstrate its applications, we performed irNorthern to detect microRNA let-7a and small nuclear RNA U6 in total RNAs extracted from HCT116 wild-type and Drosha knockout cells (Kim et al., 2016). In addition, we provide details on how to generate three different azidecontaining DNA or RNA probes for IR-dye labeling: a chemically synthesized DNA probe with an internal azide modification on dT, a DNA probe labeled with azide-dU by terminal transferase (TdT), and an RNA probe labeled with azide-U by T7 RNA polymerase.

Dysfunction in AMPK signaling is associated with a wide range of pathophysiological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurological diseases, and aging (Ronnebaum et al., 2014). Therefore, identifying activators and inhibitors of AMPK activity are important both in the development of therapeutics and to study off-target effects of other small molecules. We previously determined the chaperone effect of the enzyme CHIP on AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 holoenyzmes by measuring the phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide in the presence of radiolabeled ATP (Schisler et al., 2013). While sensitive, laboratories commonly utilize a spotting technique (each condition must be spotted individually) that is time sensitive (reactions can saturate within minutes), making dose response experiments and the simultaneous screening of multiple compounds difficult (Hastie et al., 2006). In a more recent study, we adapted a commercial FRET-based assay to study the effect of CHIP mutations on AMPK activity (Shi et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-1915	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3216	Unbiased Screening of Activated Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) in Tumor Extracts Using a Mouse Phospho-RTK Array Kit	PDGFRA, Tyrosine kinase, Proteomic array, KSHV, Kaposi’s sarcoma Background Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) (Chang et al., 1994; Ganem, 2010; Mesri et al., 2010; Dittmer and Damania, 2016). KS is a major cancer associated with AIDS (AIDS-KS) and is the most prevalent type of cancer affecting men and children in Africa (Ganem, 2010; Mesri et al., 2010; Cavallin et al., 2014). Although the incidence of AIDS-KS in the western world has markedly declined since the wide-spread implementation of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy), a significant percentage of AIDS-KS patients never achieve total remission (Krown, 2003; Nguyen et al., 2008; Cavallin et al., 2014). Moreover, KSHV prevalence and KS incidence appear to be increasing, even in HAART treated HIV patients with controlled viremias (Maurer et al., 2007; Labo et al., 2015). Understanding the interplay of viral and host factors in KS oncogenesis is critical for the rational development of new therapies (Dittmer and Krown, 2007; Sullivan et al., 2009). Many host signaling cascades co-opted by KSHV including PI3K/AKT/mTORC, NFkB and Notch are critical for cell-specific mechanisms of transformation and their identification is paving the way to therapeutic target discovery (Sodhi et al., 2006; Emuss et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Mesri et al., 2014; Dittmer and Damania, 2016). Analysis of the molecular KS signature common to human KS tumors and our mouse KS-like tumors, showed consistent expression of KS markers VEGFR 1, 2, 3, Podoplanin with upregulation of angiogenesis ligands and receptors in vivo, pointing to the upregulation of various receptor tyrosine kinase signaling axes (Mutlu et al., 2007; Mesri et al., 2010). Thus, we set out to rank the host tyrosine kinase signaling cascades activated by KSHV using a mouse model of KSHVdependent tumorigenesis that helped us to identify PDGFRA as an oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in AIDS-KS (Cavallin et al., 2018).

TBO, also known as Tolonium chloride (C_15H_16N_3S^+) , is a basic (cationic), dye that binds anionic groups in the cell and stains them distinct colors. Polyphenolic substances, such as lignin, are stained green-blue. Carboxylated polysaccharides, such as pectic acid, are stained pink-purple (Yeung, 1998). Nucleic acids are stained blue-purple. TBO has been used by plant biologists to understand the development, cellular anatomy and chemical makeup of cells for nearly one hundred years, but used more commonly after a landmark paper showed that it differentially stained different cell types and cell wall components (O’Brien et al., 1964). In Arabidopsis thaliana, TBO has been used on transverse sections of stems to identify xylem and phloem via differences in relative abundance of lignin in the secondary cell wall (Pradhan Mitra and Loqué, 2014; Verhertbruggen et al., 2017).

Under pathological conditions, podocytes may undergo mitosis and proliferate. For example, crescentic glomerulonephritis is an exceptional condition where podocytes undergo a dysregulation of their differentiated phenotype and start to proliferate and migrate, resulting in the so-called extracapillary glomerulopathy. Several studies have shown involvement of podocytes in crescentic glomerulonephritis (Moeller et al., 2004).

Bio-protocol-1923	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3208	Extraction and Purification of Laccases from Rice Stems	Laccase, Lignin, Cell wall, Phenylpropanoid pathway, Rice, Plants Background Laccases are oxidases ubiquitously present in bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. They are some of the oldest enzymes identified. Laccase is involved in diverse functions such as pigmentation of fungal spores, regeneration of plants, as fungal virulence factors, and in lignification of cell walls and delignification during wood rotting. They oxidize the biosynthesis of secondary metabolite called lignin in vascular tissues of plants. Purification of laccases is very challenging as laccases are expressed in very low amounts. Existing protocols to purify laccases are from either microorganism or softer tissues of plants such as leaves. This protocol provides an efficient approach to extract and purify laccases from harder tissues of plants such as rice stems.

Bio-protocol-1925	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3206	Quantitative Plasmodesmata Permeability Assay for Pavement Cells of Arabidopsis Leaves	Plasmodesmata, PD permeability, GFP, CMV MP-GFP, Particle bombardment Background Plasmodesmata (PD) are plant-specific channels between cells, which are important for plant growth and development as well as the interaction between plants and the surrounding environment (Maule et al., 2011; Lee, 2015; Cheval and Faulkner, 2018). Water and small molecules can pass through PD freely. Other macromolecules, e.g., proteins, RNA, and some pathogens, can also move via PD. However, the mobility of those molecules between adjacent cells is tightly regulated, although the mechanism underlying this transport is not well understood (Sevilem et al., 2015). Currently, there are several approaches reported for measuring the permeability of PD in plant tissues. One of the methods is to visualize the diffusion of fluorescent dextrans or other fluorescent probes from the targeted cells into neighboring cells (Ding et al., 1996). This approach allows the researchers to select fluorescent dextrans of different sizes which will facilitate the study of PD permeability. In addition, this method also allows researchers to perform the coinjection of fluorescent dextrans with special drugs or proteins that allows the colleagues to assay the effect of those drugs or proteins on the permeability of PD. However, this method requires a rigorous experimental system and a highly experienced operator to perform the experiments. The second method is Drop-ANd-See (DANS) which uses the 5(6)-carboxy fluorescein diacetate (CFDA) for the rapid assessment of PD permeability (Cui et al., 2015). DANS is a simple and rapid approach, but it is impossible to trace the spread of CFDA at the single cell resolution. The researchers in this field also used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001; Liarzi and Epel, 2005) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Movement Protein (MP)-GFP (CMV MP-GFP) (Iglesias and Meins, 2000) as probes to assay the permeability of PD. The expression of GFP or CMV MP-GFP was achieved by delivering plasmids expressing them into plant cells via particle bombardment. This method enables the researchers to visualize the diffusion of GFP from targeted cells into adjacent cells or cell-to-cell movement of CMV MP-GFP. Here, we introduce the detailed method of GFP diffusion and cell-to-cell movement of CMV MP-GFP, which is adapted from our recently published paper (Diao et al., 2018).

The disease triangle paradigm requires, among all, a favorable environment for disease to develop (Francl, 2001; Scholthof, 2007). High humidity, for example, represses HR development and negatively regulates ETI (Zhou et al., 2004; Xin et al., 2016; Mwimba et al., 2018). It is, thus, important to quantify the effect of environments on host-pathogen interactions.

This was achieved by (1) genomically integrating the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA; Gossen et al., 1995) from the Tet-On Advanced system (Clontech) into the cell line HEK-293T (Dai et al., 2012); the Tet-On modified HEK cell line (referred to originally as HEK-293T-tet-onLD, and subsequently as HEK-293TLD) was then (2) transfected with episomal vectors (pCEP4 series, Invitrogen; Ostertag et al., 2000; An et al., 2009) containing a tetracycline response element promoter (pTRE-Tight, Clontech), which permitted (3) expression of the L1 cassette in response to the presence of doxycycline in the culture medium (Dai et al., 2012; O'Donnell et al., 2013). More recently, we have used this system to study the compositions of affinity isolated L1 RNPs (Taylor et al., 2016)–including the interactomic consequences of treating them with a mixture of RNases A and T1 while immobilized on affinity medium, revealing which proteins become labile upon the treatment compared to a control (Taylor et al., 2013 and 2018). The following protocol, detailed from Taylor et al. (2018), will enable users to obtain affinity enriched L1 RNPs suitable for the aforementioned RNase-sensitivity assay and can be easily adapted to include treatments with various enzymes not specifically described herein. A schematic diagram of the procedure is presented in Figure 1.

The difficulty is from the induction of behavioral changes associated with the psychiatric condition to the evaluation or measurement of such behavior. Depression is a psychiatric disorder with high prevalence and, as a high cognitive complexity disorder, is hard to be assessed in animal models. Stress (mainly social stress) is already well established in the literature as a key factor for the establishment of depression (Kendler et al., 1999; Gold and Chrousos, 2002; Slavich and Irwin, 2014; Saleh et al., 2017), so it is not surprising that animal models of depression use some kind of stress.

Since these diseases are mainly biofilm-associated, a better understanding of how E. faecalis forms biofilms within the host can enable us to develop novel antibacterial therapies (Dunny et al., 2014).

Bio-protocol-1937	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3194	Peptide Feeding and Mechanical Wounding for Tomato Seedlings	Tomato, Systemin, Peptide signaling, Wounding, Wound response, Plant-insect interaction Background Peptide signaling plays crucial roles in regulating plant growth, development and interaction with the surrounding environment (Tavormina et al., 2015). Perception of the peptide systemin, for example, is critical for resistance against chewing insect larvae (Pearce et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2018). Attack by such larvae and related wounding lead to various immune responses, one of which is the induction of defense-related marker genes. In tomato, the genes encoding proteinase inhibitor 1 (PIN1) and proteinase inhibitor 2 (PIN2) were shown to be highly activated after insect feeding or wounding, and have been extensively used as hallmarks for defense triggered by insects or wounding (Pearce et al., 1991; Ryan and Pearce, 2003). Here we provide a protocol focusing on details of peptide feeding and wounding assays, which can be followed by quantification of PIN1 transcript via qRT-PCR. The protocol has been optimized to minimize variations inherent in these assays and was previously used to assess the function of systemin perception (Wang et al., 2018).

The technique has been widely employed in developmental biology to characterize the spatial and temporal distributions of target mRNAs in fixed embryos (Thisse et al., 2001; Thisse and Thisse, 2004 and 2005). By allowing the comparison of mRNA distributions in wild-type, mutant and experimentally manipulated embryos, in situ hybridization continues to play a vital role in the investigation of gene function in development.

Bio-protocol-1940	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3191	Quantification of Queuosine Modification Levels in tRNA from	Queuosine, tRNA modification, tRNA, Queuine, Microbiome Background Transfer RNAs (tRNA) contain nucleotide modifications that perform a wide range of roles in translation and in the generation of tRNA fragments that are functional small RNAs. Queuosine (Q, Figure 1) is a tRNA modification that occurs in the wobble anticodon position of tRNAs coding for amino acids Tyr, His, Asn, and Asp. All these tRNAs contain G^34U^35N^36 anticodon sequences. In bacteria, G34-to-Q34 modification can be synthesized de novo through a cascade of enzyme reactions (El Yacoubi et al., 2012). In mammals, the G34 base in these tRNAs can be replaced with queuine (Figure 1) derived from either gut microbiome or diet by a two-protein complex enzyme QTRT1 (catalytic subunit) and QTRT2 encoded in the host genome. Q is widely distributed among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, but its cellular roles are still not fully understood (Rakovich et al., 2011; Fergus et al., 2015; Tuorto et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). For example, tRNA Q-modification levels have been correlated with cancer progression and cellular metabolism.

Most of water uptake studies have been made by measuring soil water content variation with time. In the field, such measurements are based on the use of moisture sensors distributed in soil such as neutron moisture meter (Hignett and Evett, 2002) or electromagnetic TDR or capacitive sensors (Li et al., 2002). In a controlled condition, with potted plants, the weight of the pot can be used to determine pot water content. However, if these kinds of measurements are well suited to describe macroscopic soil water behavior, they do not give access to detailed distribution of water around roots and to the interactions for water between roots. Also, they do not reveal the distribution and functioning of roots.

Cells control levels of individual RNA species via regulation of their transcription and RNA decay rates. Hence, measuring those parameters has been a traditional focus area in molecular biology, and numerous techniques have been developed to interrogate them. Among the many methods to measure transcription, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNA polymerase and its higher resolution variant ChIP-exo (Rhee and Pugh, 2011), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq, Core et al., 2008) and its successor ‘Precision nuclear Run On sequencing (PRO-seq, Kwak et al., 2013), and nascent elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq, Churchman and Weissman, 2011) are all readily applicable to genome-wide analysis and have, arguably, received most attention in recent years. RNA stability is usually measured by distinct methodology including pulse-chase type experiments or by following RNA decline after transcription shut-off. More recently, pulse-only application of metabolic labeling (i.e., with 4-thiouridine or 5-bromouridine) has been shown to allow for measurement of RNA stability without employing a chase (Miller et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012, Neymotin et al., 2014; Rabani et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-1943	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3188	Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) into an Effective Model of Forebrain Neural Progenitor Cells and Mature Neurons	iPSC, Forebrain, Cortical, NSC, NPC, Neuron Background Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are stem cells produced from non-pluripotent source cells and tissues (Shi et al., 2017). Due to their ability to differentiate into a wide range of cell types, they are a promising avenue for improving our understanding of human development and treatment of degenerative diseases (Marchetto et al., 2011). Of particular interest are iPSC-derived models of human forebrain neurons, as these cells are known to mediate higher order brain functions, including consciousness (Baxter and Chiba, 1999), emotion (Morgane et al., 2005), and sleep (Schwartz and Roth, 2008). As a result, deficits in these cells can cause a wide range of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s (Auld et al., 2002) and Huntington’s (McColgan and Tabrizi, 2018), as well as neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism (Donovan and Basson, 2017) and epilepsy (Heath, 1976). As there are few effective forebrain models for humans, the discovery of iPSCs spurred a rapid push to develop effective protocols to differentiate iPSCs to forebrain neurons (Srikanth and Young-Pearse, 2014). The first protocols that were developed drew upon previous work using embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which relied upon feeder cell cultures. This complicated the procedure and raised concerns about clinical applications. Later protocols were able to generate forebrain neurons without using feeder cells (Bell et al., 2017), with some eliminating all animal generated products entirely (Yuan et al., 2015). It can be difficult to make an all-encompassing statement about the protocols currently used to generate forebrain NPCs, due to the multitude of labs currently generating forebrain neurons and the many variables that can be changed and optimized. However, many of the recently most cited published protocols for the generation of forebrain NPCs and neurons can be divided into two kinds, monolayer and embryoid bodies (EBs) protocols. In an EB based protocol, iPSCs are dissociated and plated in suspension in a neural induction media to allow them to form EBs, which gradually aggregate over 5-7 days (Pasca et al., 2011). These EBs are then transferred to a plate that supports cell attachment, enabling the embryoid bodies to attach to the bottom of the plate and spread out into a neural rosette. From this rosette, neural stem cells (NSCs) arise, which can be passaged to form relatively stable neural progenitors cells (NPCs) (Shi et al., 2012). NPCs can then be plated in a neuronal induction media to give rise to mature neurons (Bell et al., 2017). Monolayer based protocols chiefly differ in that iPSC colonies are maintained as a monolayer during neural induction, and develop directly into rosettes without aggregation (Chandrasekaran et al., 2017). Using either approach, generation of NPCs from iPSCs is typically reported to require 21-30 days, with electrically active neurons requiring an additional ^30+ days of differentiation from NPCs, for a total time of ^50+ days to generate forebrain neurons from iPSCs (Yuan et al., 2015).

A defining factor of the genetic component for disease inception is the predisposition to developing allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E to common allergens, otherwise known as atopy (Sly et al., 2008). As such, allergic (atopic) sensitization to innocuous perennial aeroallergens during early childhood is now recognized as a fundamental risk factor in the establishment of potentially life-long allergic asthmatic disease (Illi et al., 2006; Sly et al., 2008), particularly when sensitization occurs to multiple aeroallergens (Stoltz et al., 2013).

The classical hallmark features of the disease include elevated antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin E, C D4^+ T-helper (Th) type 2-driven eosinophilic inflammation and reversible airways hyperresponsiveness to innocuous environmental antigens (Bousquet et al., 2000; Holgate, 2008).

Bio-protocol-1953	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3178	Characterization of Mouse Adult Testicular Macrophage Populations by Immunofluorescence Imaging and Flow Cytometry	Macrophage, Testis, FACS, IF, Spermatogenesis, Immune-privilege organ Background The testis is the male reproductive organ where spermatogenesis and testosterone production occurs. tMΦ might be considered as “guardians of fertility” by their immuno-suppressive function to assure the immune-privilege status of the testis and their trophic roles in spermatogenesis and male hormone production, but the distinct functions of these macrophage populations are only starting to be elucidated (Mossadegh-Keller and Sieweke, 2018). Tissue-resident macrophages exhibit tissue-specific functions and gene expression patterns depending of their organs of residency (Gentek et al., 2014; Lavin et al., 2014) but also share common core tissue-resident macrophage markers as F4/80, CD11b, CD64, M-CSFR and for some tissues CX3CR1 (Gordon, 2002; Gautier et al., 2012; Yona et al., 2013; Gentek et al., 2014). Recently, two testicular macrophages (tMΦ) populations have been characterized using IF imaging and FACS (DeFalco et al., 2015; Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2017). Interstitial tMΦ can be identified by microscopy by their rounded morphology and localization in the interstitial space of the testis in close contact with testosterone-producing Leydig cells (Smith and Walker, 2014; DeFalco et al., 2015; Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2017). In contrast, the peritubular tMΦ exhibit an elongated morphology and surround the seminiferous tubules housing spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) (DeFalco et al., 2015; Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2017). Confirming previous observations (DeFalco et al., 2015), we observed that both tMΦ were positive for CX3CR1 and F4/80 by IF. Interstitial tMΦ can be distinguished by the strong expression of M-CSFR from peritubular tMΦ that selectively express high levels of MHCII (Figure 2) (Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2017). We further analyzed in depth the interstitial and peritubular tMΦ populations by FACS. We established an extended antibody panel going beyond previous protocols (DeFalco et al., 2015), excluding monocytes and dendritic cells and including CD64 as a key tissue-resident macrophage (Gautier et al., 2012; Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2017). Within the tMΦ CD45+Ly6C-CD11cloF4/80+CD11b+ fraction, we defined interstitial tM Phi as M-CSFR+CD64hiMHCIIcells and peritubular tM Phi as M-CSFRloCD64loMHCII+ cells (Figure 3).

However, most antibodies generated so far by immunization with a recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli react only with the immunizing recombinant proteins, but not with the native proteins on cell surfaces. The same problems have often been experienced with immunization with peptides as antigens. In order to generate  mAbs  which  could  recognize  the  native  proteins,  we  have  developed  the  original DNA-immunization method in which plasmid DNA is directly transferred into mouse skeletal muscle in vivo utilizing Escherichia coli (E. coli) GroEL (Fujimoto et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2011) and hyaluronidase. E. coli GroEL, is a molecular chaperone that is responsible for the transportation and refolding of proteins and GroEL fusion proteins are highly expressed in the soluble fraction (Furutani et al., 2005). Further, E. coli GroEL also acts as an adjuvant via TLR4 (Fujimoto et al., 2012).

It has also been shown to be distributed widely in plants. In our previous research, we reported that deficiency of serotonin in rice plants enhances its BPH and SSB resistance, and the addition of serotonin in plant growth medium results in a loss of insect resistance in mutants (Lu et al., 2018). Here, we provide detailed protocols for determination of serotonin in rice plants, and in SSB and BPH insects, together with the methods for feeding SSB and BPH in artificial diets (added with exogenous serotonin).

Bio-protocol-1963	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3168	Analysis of Early Phase HIV-1 Replication and Integration Events by Using Real-time PCR	HIV-1, Reverse transcription, 2-LTR cycle DNA, Integration, Real-time PCR Background After binding to the receptor and fusing to the host cell’s lipid bilayers, the HIV-1 nucleoprotein complex first enters the cytoplasm, crosses the nuclear envelope, and finally integrates the reverse-transcribed HIV genome into that of the host cell. During this early phase of replication, HIV1 converts its single-stranded RNA genome into linear double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm by an intricate reverse transcription process (Hu and Hughes, 2012). After nuclear import, some of these linear viral genomes are integrated into the host chromatin. These are termed proviruses. The remaining cDNA that fails to integrate is circularized into either 1-LTR circle DNA or 2-LTR circle DNAs (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011). HIV-1 can counteract various host restriction factors that can interfere with its early phase replication events (Zheng et al., 2012). Molecular assays used to detect and analyze changes in HIV-1 early phase replication events are valuable tools in studying HIV pathogenesis and in developing potential antiretroviral drugs. We report here methods to quantitatively analyze several critical events during HIV-1 early phase replication by using Real-time PCR. The early, intermediate and late stages of reverse transcription events are represented by the initiation of HIV-1 minus strand DNA synthesis, the elongation of minus-strand DNA synthesis following transfer of minus strand DNA, and the synthesis of complete double-stranded linear viral DNA after plus-strand DNA transfer respectively. Given that 2-LTR circles are exclusively found in the cell nucleus, they have become a useful marker of viral nuclear import (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011). As shown in Figure 1, a nested PCR is utilized to quantify HIV-1 integration with increased sensitivity and specificity. Since Alu sequences are the most abundant repetitive DNA, containing over one million copies dispersed throughout the human genome, the 1^st round of PCR is designed to amplify a fragment between the integrated HIV-1 gag gene and the host genomic Alu sequence element. Both forward and reverse Alu PCR primers are used in 1^st round Alugag PCR, since either orientation of Alu sequence can exist in human genome. To avoid the amplification of unintegrated HIV-1 cDNA, the 5’ end of 1^st PCR gag R primer is tagged with a unique R sequence. Only the 1^st round PCR amplicons containing the R sequence can be used as templates in the 2^n d round of Real-time PCR. The optimized TaqMan Real-time PCR reagent is used to increase assay sensitivity and reproducibility. All PCR primers, probe sequences, and their amplicon locations are listed in Table 1.

However, there has been no practical culture system to effectively induce expansion of B cells with high viability and differentiation towards GC B cells. To study the GC B cell biology in vitro, we have developed a novel B-cell culture system that mimics GC B-cell reaction (Nojima et al., 2011). For this system, we generated a feeder cell line named 40LB, a Balb/c 3T3 cell line expressing exogenous CD40-ligand (CD40L) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) that together promote B cell proliferation and survival. When naive B cells are cultured with IL-4 for the first 4 days and then with IL-21 for the second 4 days on the feeder cells, B cells proliferate exponentially up to 10,000 fold, efficiently undergo isotype switching to IgG1 and IgE, the Th2 related isotypes, and express GC B-cell markers such as GL7 and Fas. Thus, we termed the B cells propagated in this system in-vitro-induced GC B (iGB) cells, and this system the iGB cell culture system. Compared to simply stimulating B cells with anti-CD40 antibody and BAFF with IL-4, which can induce only a 20-fold expansion of B cells in 6 days and less efficient isotype switching, iGB cell culture system is very useful. The iGB cell culture system have been widely used to study B cell biology, such as GC B cell expansion and differentiation, signaling from various receptors, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and so on (Fukao et al., 2014; Haniuda et al., 2016). The iGB cells not only phenotypically resemble genuine GC B cells but they functionally mimic some aspects of GC B cells: the iGB cells after the primary culture with IL-4 differentiate in vivo into memory-like B cells when transferred into mice, whereas those after the secondary culture with IL-21 differentiate in vivo into plasma cells that are relatively long-lived (Nojima et al., 2011; Moutai et al., 2014). Hence the iGB cell culture system is also applicable for the studies of molecular mechanisms for their differentiation into memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells, and their responses (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Here, we describe a detailed protocol for the iGB cell culture system.

Since people are living longer, there is an increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with aging (Jaul and Barron, 2017), such as neurodegeneration (Brown et al., 2005). To understand the degree of impairment and to investigate therapeutic options scientists need tools, such as behavioral tests. Assessing behavioral outcomes facilitates this knowledge acquisition, which then gives rationale to study mechanisms and potential therapeutics.

Bio-protocol-1971	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3160	Imaging Higher-order Chromatin Structures in Single Cells	Higher-order chromatin, Epigenetic, Histone modification, Super-resolution, STORM Background Recent advances in super-resolution imaging technique provide new potentials to observe the biological structures at the molecular scale. In particular, single-molecule localization based super-resolution technique such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has become a valuable tool to directly observe higher-order chromatin structure in situ down to ~20-30 nm resolution (Xu et al., 2018). Although many detailed protocols have been devoted for STORM imaging in general, few have been focused on imaging higher-order chromatin structures. Chromatin has densely packed structure, and the nucleus of mammalian cells tends to be thicker than other membrane-based proteins. Such samples tend to give higher background and present more overlapping fluorescent emitters. Therefore, the proper optimization of nuclear staining for STORM imaging is critical to obtain high-quality super-resolution images of chromatin structure. A compromise in any of staining steps may lead to significant image artifacts and degradation in image resolution. Here we provide detailed protocols for STORM-based super-resolution imaging of higher-order chromatin structure marked by either DNA and histone proteins. We also provide detailed procedures on the conjugation of the fluorophores with secondary antibodies, for single-color and two-color STORM imaging. The protocol presented here is optimized for STORM imaging, we believe that this protocol can also be extended to most highresolution fluorescence imaging of chromatin structures or other proteins of interest.

The development and early testing of the method are described in Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2017. Here, we present a protocol for establishment and evaluation of the fly stocks that can be used for functional annotation of genes in a tissue-specific manner throughout the development of Drosophila. The method, called “Flip-flop”, is built upon the versatile Minos mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) platform (Venken et al., 2011; Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015a and 2015b) and involves genomic integration of the “Flip-flop cassette” that contains two modules: a protein-trap (PT) module and a genetrap (GT) module (Figure 1A). The PT-module tags the gene of interest with EGFP at the endogenous locus, whereas the GT module facilitates generation of truncation mutants that express mCherry under the control of the natural regulatory elements of the gene. Once the cassette is inserted in a coding intron in the PT orientation, it can be reversed into the opposite GT-orientation in vivo with the help of FLP. The inversion marks the mutant cells, as they express mCherry under the endogenous gene’s control, and helps distinguish them from the rest of the tissue expressing EGFP tagged protein (Figure 1B). There are several advantages of Flip-flop over the traditional method MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker; Lee and Luo, 1999): First, the control cells and the mutant cells are marked with EGFP and mCherry respectively, and the reporters are expressed at the endogenous level. This removes the need for introducing additional fluorescent reporters and GAL4 drivers required in

Acute loss of one-tenth of body water can result in death in humans, while chronic water imbalance causes multiple disorders and accelerates the aging process (Minassian et al., 1989; Dmitrieva and Burg, 2011 and 2015; Hbibi et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Water-seeking behavior has been well studied in a number of animal groups, but the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms involved in water-seeking are still poorly understood. The experimental method described below could be used to study the genetic mechanisms and neural circuits that regulate hygrotactic behavior, drinking motivation, thirst perception and water sensation in Drosophila.
Bio-protocol-1978	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3153	Induction and Analysis of Anti-CD40-induced Colitis in Mice	Anti-CD40, Colitis, IBD, Innate immunity, Inflammation, IL-23, IL-22 Background Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis, affects about 1.5 million people in the United States (Ng et al., 2017). To better understand the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of IBD, a number of pre-clinical models (i.e., DSS, TNBS, anti-CD40, etc.) have been developed to address various aspects of immune response during tissue injury over the last two decades. CD40 is highly expressed by the colon lamina propria antigen presenting cells. We have demonstrated that activation of CD40 signaling using an agonist anti-CD40 antibody can trigger colitis in T and B cells deficient mice (here referred as R a g^-/- mice) driven by excessive production of IL-23, IL- 1 and IL-12 by myeloid cells (Uhlig et al., 2006). Anti-CD40 model is a unique model of colitis driven by IL-23-producing gut resident C X3C R1^+ macrophages and IL-22-producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) (Bauche et al., 2018). This model of colitis is restricted to the proximal colon and is a potent model to study the role of innate immunity in colon inflammation.  Here,  we  describe  a  robust  and  reproducible  method  to  induce  and  analyze anti-CD40-induced colitis in mice. Anti-CD40-treated R a g2^-/- mice lose up to 20% of their initial weight within three days post injection, and then return to their initial weight by Day 7 post induction (Figure 1A). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can be detected in the proximal colon as soon as Day 1 post induction (Cayatte et al., 2012) (Figure 1B) but maximal disease–characterized by massive infiltration of innate immune cells, loss of goblet cells and development of mitotic figures–is observed in the proximal colon at day 7 post disease induction (Figure 1C). Immune cell infiltration in the proximal colon and cytokine production, such as IL-22, by innate lymphoid cells can be measured by flow cytometry (Figure 1D).

Protein microarrays used to be generated with proteins that were isolated from recombinant cellular libraries. This approach is work-intensive, time-consuming and costly, however, since it requires the individual handling of very many cells. Each gene of interest is amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by cloning into an expression vector. After transformation into a cellular system–frequently Escherichia coli (E. coli)–the cell clones are grown separately from others and characterized. Subsequently, the respective overexpressed protein is isolated and purified, followed by immobilization on the microarray. Our largest array of a non-mammalian gene set consisted of 14,000 proteins (Syafrizayanti et al., 2017), for example. Therefore, producing this array would have required going through the above process 14,000 times.

Xanthi Leaf Explants Ana Lilia Rosales-Campos and Abel Gutiérrez-Ortega*	Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Genetic transformation, In vitro culture Background Plants have been exploited as expression bioreactors for vaccine antigens, antibodies for immunotherapy, nutritional supplements, enzymes, and even peptides of interest with industrial applications (Sharma and Sharma, 2009). They require relatively low financial investment to conduct initial studies, constituting a large advantage for biotechnology entrepreneurs (Yao et al., 2015). After the first plant transformation reports (Fraley et al., 1983; Herrera-Estrella et al., 1983), protocols have not changed a lot using Agrobacteria as a method for this purpose; nevertheless, other methods have been developed to enhance transformation efficiency, such as biolistics. Currently, tobacco is among the most important plant platforms for protein expression; its cells, as other eukaryotic cells, can perform post-translational modifications to the proteins of interest and tobacco plants can be easily regenerated by organogenesis or embryogenesis; additionally, its genome is completely sequenced. Current protocols allow for the insertion of multiple transgenes, requiring only one selectable marker (Wang, 2015). Our protocol is based on Curtis et al. (1995) and involves co-cultivation Agrobacterium-Nicotiana tabacum, like another protocol with algae (Pratheesh et al., 2014) or fungi. We were able to transform Nicotiana tabacum with a binary plasmid that contained two expression cassettes for the simultaneous expression of two viral antigens and confirmed that both genes were expressed by RT-PCR analysis in transformed plants.

Bio-protocol-1984	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3147	flySAM Transgenic CRISPRa System Manual	CRISPR-Cas nuclease, dCas9, Drosophila, CRISPRa, flySAM Background Currently, most of the genes in Drosophila can be knocked down or knocked out through powerful genetic tools and several loss-of-function (LOF) resources have been established based on these tools (Ren et al., 2013; Qiao et al., 2018). A similar gain-of-function (GOF) resource is valuable to study gene function as it can be a complement to LOF. However, we do not have a genome-wide GOF resource until now mainly because of technical difficulties. The traditional gene overexpression system in Drosophila is the Gal4/UAS:cDNA system. It needs to clone the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of a gene downstream of the upstream activation sequence (UAS) which can be controlled by Gal4 transcription factor. It is laborious, expensive and sometimes unachievable. Therefore, an easier way to realize GOF is urgently needed. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is an effective genome-editing tool. The transcriptional activation system in Drosophila based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, termed “CRISPR transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system”, has been developed in recent years (Konermann et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Ewen-Campen et al., 2017). Cas9 has HNH and RuvC nuclease domains which are responsible for the cutting of complementary and non-complementary DNA strand, respectively. Through introducing single amino acid mutation within HNH and RuvC domains of Cas9 (dCas9), nuclease activity of Cas9 is abolished without affecting its DNA binding ability (Dominguez et al., 2016). The CRISPR transcriptional activation CRISPRa system is generated by fusing several activation domains to dCas9 and can be recruited to the upstream of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) through single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The specificity of CRISPRa system is controlled by 20 bp guide sequence in sgRNA, thus one can simply use the 20 bp guide sequence against different targets. Previously, VPRbased CRISPRa system has been built in Drosophila in vivo and in vitro (Lin et al., 2015; Ewen-Campen et al., 2017). In this system, three activation domains, VP64, P65, Rta (VPR), tandemly following the dCas9. However, due to low efficiency, this system relies on two sgRNAs to boost gene transcription, which not only increased the complicacy and cost of the cloning procedure, but also increased toxicity and the chances of off-target effects. In addition, although it works both in vitro and in vivo, it often produces weaker phenotypes than the traditional Gal4/UAS:cDNA system.
Bio-protocol-1985	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3146	Insulin Tolerance Test under Anaesthesia to Measure Tissue-specific	Insulin, Adipose tissue, Muscle, Glucose transport, Glucose uptake, Insulin tolerance test Background Surrogate measures of whole-body insulin sensitivity such as homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) often do not reflect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues of the mouse (Lee et al., 2008; Mather, 2009). Ex vivo adipose tissue explants or isolated skeletal muscles preparations (Burchfield et al., 2018; Fazakerley et al., 2018b) can allow direct measurement of insulin responses in specific tissues if they are amenable to these procedures, but do not preserve the organism environment where finely articulated delivery of glucose and insulin via the vasculature, uptake into cells and intracellular metabolism may all contribute to the overall rate of tissue glucose uptake (Wasserman et al., 2011). Commonly employed methods to assess whole-body insulin action in mice include intraperitoneal (IP) or intravenous insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) and, the gold standard, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (Ayala et al., 2010; Brandon et al., 2016). These techniques can assess whole-body insulin action by measuring either changes in blood glucose (ITT) or  changes in  the  amount  of  glucose  required  to  maintain glycemia (glucose  infusion  rate; hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp) and can be adapted to measure tissue-specific insulin responses. For example, glucose tracers such as radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG), which is often used as a surrogate for glucose in assessing glucose uptake as it is not metabolized through glycolysis and is ‘trapped’ in the cells following uptake, can be introduced to permit assessment of glucose uptake into specific tissues during these tests. Note that 2-DOG is only trapped in tissues that do not possess significant glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and so 2-DOG tracer is therefore not useful for assessing glucose disposal in the liver.

Bio-protocol-1988	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3143	Intracellular Invasion and Killing Assay to Investigate the Effects of Binge Alcohol Toxicity in Murine Alveolar Macrophages	Alcohol, Burkholderia, Macrophage, Binge drinking, Phagocytosis, Virulence Background Alcohol is widely accepted as the most popular recreational drug with well-documented adverse effects associated across geographic and social boundaries (Jones and Holmgren, 2009; Pruett et al., 2010). Studies in both human and animal models indicate that acute alcohol or binge alcohol  intake,  which  is  characterized  by  consumption  of  alcohol  reaching  a  blood  alcohol concentration of at least 0.08% within ^2-3~h~ , may be associated with increased health risks over the lifetime of the individual (Wechsler and Nelson, 2008; Moreira et al., 2009). We and others have demonstrated that excessive alcohol consumption is linked to impairment of macrophage function and increased risk for pulmonary infections and sepsis (Bhatty et al., 2011). Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first line of defense during pulmonary infections, typically located in the distal respiratory tract (Knapp et al., 2003), and are capable of detecting, capturing, and eliminating invading pathogens while being responsible for initiating the early host immune response (Renwick et al., 2001; Qiu et al., 2012). Moreover, alcohol toxicity suppresses bacterial phagocytosis and killing in J774.16 macrophages when infected with Acinetobacter baumannii (Boé et al., 2001; Asplund et al., 2013). Additionally, chronic alcohol increases expression of virulence factors during infections and decreases pulmonary immune defenses in infections caused by Mycobacterium avium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (Bermudez et al., 1993; Gordon et al., 2000; Goral et al., 2008; Camarena et al., 2010). The present assay was designed to investigate the effects of a single binge alcohol exposure on AM engulfment and intracellular killing of less virulent Gram-negative Burkholderia thailandensis. Our results indicate that a single binge alcohol episode can increase opportunistic bacterial infectivity while decreasing host innate immune responses to infection. Understanding the modulating capacity of very low alcohol exposure to alter the initial interaction between host immune mechanisms and pathogens during infection, provides important new insights into how risk factors such as alcohol can increase the infectivity of other non-virulent pathogens in otherwise healthy human hosts.

These two elements can form a complex where the sgRNA guides the Cas9 protein to the specific DNA sequences, resulting in the double-stranded DNA break. Compared with the traditional gene editing system like ZFN and TALEN, the efficient CRISPRCas9 system is simpler to design and easier to manipulate, which greatly expands its applications.

Endochondral ossification is required for proper skeletal development during embryogenesis and has been recently demonstrated to be involved in the bone regeneration and joint diseases postnatally (Kawaguchi, 2008). Mesenchymal cells could be used as a regenerative therapy for these diseases. To study the mechanisms regulating endochondral skeletal development, we have examined high-density micromass cultures of embryonic limb-bud mesenchymal cells (Gay and Kosher, 1984; Iezaki et al., 2018). The in vitro chondrogenic cell culture system is useful for the analysis cartilage nodule formation that results from the condensation of mesenchymal cells and differentiation into chondrocytes.

It was introduced as a new model organism by Sydney Brenner in the 1960s to study neural development. Since then, it has been extensively studied because of the simple anatomy, the easy cultivation, and the rapid growth. The reproductive life cycle of C. elegans, which takes only three days, consists of the embryonic stage, four larval stages (L1-L4), and the adult stage. After 14~h~ of embryogenesis, C. elegans grows in size during the four larval stages which are divided by each molt, then it reaches the adult stage which can produce the next generation. In unfavorable conditions, C. elegans larvae can choose the alternative developmental pathway, so-called “dauer”, which can survive a few months in the adverse conditions. When the environment becomes favorable, C. elegans exits the dauer stage and develops into the L4 stage.

Several major events occur in mitochondria, of which, the most significant is the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (_M) (Green and Reed, 1998). Throughout the life of a cell, the mitochondria uses oxidizable substrates to produce an electrochemical proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane which is used to produce ATP. The direction of the mitochondrial membrane potential (with the interior of the organelle being electronegative) is such to produce inward transport of cations and outward transport of anions, thus promoting accumulation of cations in the mitochondria (Zorova et al., 2018). This electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP. However, during apoptosis, _M decreases as the process is associated with the opening of the mitochondrial permeability pores and loss of the electrochemical gradient. Thus, _M is an essential parameter of the mitochondrial function that can be used as an indicator of cell health since mitochondria are inherently involved in the apoptotic process of cells.

Bio-protocol-2008	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3123	Method for Studying the Effect of Gene Silencing on Bacterial Infection-induced ERK1/2 Signaling in Bone-marrow Derived Macrophages	Bone-marrow derived macrophages, Salmonella, Infection, ERK signaling, Western blotting Background Macrophages are phagocytic cells which can either be resident to specific tissues as Kupffer cells (in the liver) and peritoneal macrophages (in peritoneal cavity) or, can enter tissues in response to an infection. The primary function of macrophages involves phagocytosis and clearance of old damaged cells, and recycling of nutrients in the serum (recently reviewed in Shapouri-Moghaddam et al., 2018). However, for macrophages to clear microbes, there exists a need for their activation. Macrophages obtained from many tissues such as alveoli and peritoneal cavity includes high numbers of pre-activated macrophage population. However, macrophages derived from myeloid progenitor cells present in the bone marrow are comparatively naive and more responsive to activating stimulus (Epelman et al., 2014). Upon encounter of gram-negative bacteria by macrophages, LPS present on either the surface of a bacterium or shed by bacteria in the blood flow is captured by LBP (LPS-binding protein) and presented as a ligand to TLR4, a type I transmembrane protein present on the plasma membrane of macrophage that mediate the recognition of PAMPS such as LPS (Shimazu et al., 1999). The engagement of LPS with TLR4 (along with other co-stimulatory molecules) leads to recruitment of several adaptor proteins at the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 followed by a cascade of intracellular events leading to activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades downstream to TLR4 including ERK1/2 (Buscher et al., 1995; Schaeffer and Weber, 1999; Gay et al., 2014; Platko et al., 2018; Arya et al., 2018). These signaling pathways directly or indirectly phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors that lead to the expression of genes involved in production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, nitrosative burst and promotes macrophage activation (Satoh and Akira, 2016). Thus, ERK1/2 signaling plays an important role in augmenting macrophage response against intracellular pathogens. This protocol describes a method to investigate the role of a host factor of interest in modulating ERK1/2 activation in primary BMDMs in response to Salmonella typhimurium infection (see schematic shown in Figure 1 and Arya et al., 2018).

Bio-protocol-2012	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3119	Isolation of Microvesicles from Human Circulating Neutrophils	Microvesicles, Neutrophils, Isolation, Differential centrifugation, Cytospin Background Microvesicles (MVs) are a type of extracellular vesicle that can be between 100 to 1,000 nm in size (Leblanc et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2021). They are produced by exocytic budding from the plasma membrane and can be shed from diverse cell types as a result of events such as cell activation by stimuli or apoptosis (Lima et al., 2011). Stimuli activating these events increase intracellular calcium, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and eventually microvesicle budding (Distler et al., 2005). MVs can carry specific sets of secreted molecules between cells, such as functional proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids including mRNAs and microRNAs, making them an important mode of intercellular communication (Leblanc et al., 2017). Through horizontal transfer of these molecules, MVs have the ability to transcriptionally regulate target cells (Greening et al., 2017). This ability, coupled with their association with a multitude of different diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and various cancers, makes them interesting targets for disease modification. MVs also exhibit superior potential as non-invasive biomarkers for certain diseases, as they are detectable in all biological fluids, including blood (both serum and plasma), urine, and saliva (Leblanc et al., 2017). Moreover, surface proteins differ based on the type of cell they are shed from (Lima et al., 2011), and both the inducer and severity of disease can alter what set of molecules MVs carry (Ridger et al., 2017).

External stresses, such as chemical agents cause damage or mutation to the DNA and, if left unrepaired, will propagate to the offspring and lead to genomic instability. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is one example of a chemical (alkylating) agent that methylates DNA bases and stalls the replication fork, thereby generating double-strand breaks (DSBs) when the replication fork collapses (Arnaudeau et al., 2001). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, DSBs are often repaired by the error-free homologous recombination (HR) pathway (Ferreira and Cooper, 2004). HR proteins, such as Rhp54, lead to foci formation in response to MMS treatment, with the number of foci formed increasing proportionately to the level of DNA damage (Maki et al., 2011). Recent work has shown that a mutation in the histone H3 methyltransferase Set2 can affect Rhp54 foci formation during MMS treatment, thereby suggesting a role for Set2 in MMS resistance (Lim et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-2015	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3116	Quantitation of Regulatory Activity for the Complement Alternative Pathway Using an Adaptation of the pmb A P50 in vitro Assay	Complement, Alternative pathway, A P50 , Factor H, Regulators of complement activity Background Complement is part of the innate immune system and acts to recognize and clear pathogens and stimulate adaptive immune responses. The three complement pathways, the classical (CP), lectin (LP) and alternative pathways (AP), constitute a series of cleavage and activation of complement proteins, generating enzymatically active protein complexes, such as convertase complexes, and bioactive split products, such as C3a. The three pathways converge on cleavage of the complement component C3 and one common downstream outcome is the generation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) and subsequent lysis of target cells (Ricklin et al., 2010). Functional activity of complement can be measured by assays such as the 50% complement hemolytic activity (CH50 assay), where a stimulus (antibody coated red blood cells), is provided in vitro to the complement components in a biological sample. The subsequent lysis of the target red blood cells (RBC) is quantitated by release of hemoglobin and measured by an increase in optical density. If target complement components such as C3 are missing from the test biological sample, either genetically or due to complement consumption resulting from activation of complement in vivo, then C H_50 will be low.

Natural silk fiber from Bombyx mori has to undergo a series of processing steps to become a regenerated liquid silk fibroin. The liquid silk can be easily made into various forms of silk biomaterials, such as micro- or nano-particles, regenerated fibers, artificial skin, and porous matrix or 3D scaffolds, biomimetic nanofibrous scaffolds, a platform for transistors and various classes of photonic devices. The structure and properties of the final forms of silk biomaterials depend evidently on the molecular size of the regenerated liquid silk which is affected by a series of processing steps including degumming and fibroin fiber dissolution. Our investigation showed that boiling and degumming in a 0.1%-0.5% Na2CO3 solution used most frequently in the laboratory can not only cause a large amount of sericin degradation and hydrolysis but also leads to serious breakage of the silk fibroin peptide chain and its mechanical properties decreasing (Wang and Zhang, 2013). The low purity, high concentration, and improper storage conditions easily induce regenerated liquid silk gelling or coagulating and denaturing. The partially chain-broken polypeptides of silk fibroin can be converted into silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs) in acetone (Zhang et al., 2007). During this process the molecular structure of the regenerated liquid silk has changed rapidly from random-coil and a-helix form (Silk I) into anti-parallel  -sheet form (Silk II). The resulting crystalline silk nanoparticles may offer various possibilities for surface modification of industrial materials and enzyme/drug delivery system (Zhang et al., 2011).

For a cell to move forward, it needs to be able to attach and reuse its integrins. These steps involve various small GTPases that control the intracellular transport of proteins. Small GTPases switch from active to inactive form by hydrolysis of GTP into GDP, which is controlled by specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Cavalli et al., 2001). RhoB is one of these important small GTPases that regulates endosomal trafficking of receptors in different cell types including leukocytes (Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005). We have recently found that the major integrin used by T lymphocytes, Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is recycled by a Rab11-dependent pathway that is controlled by RhoB activity (Samuelsson et al., 2017). Here, we present a protocol to measure RhoB activation based on the pulldown of active RhoB with commercially available Rhotekin-coated agarose beads. The Rhotekin-RBD protein specifically recognizes and binds to the active, GTP-bound form of the Rho protein. Furthermore, we describe integrin-dependent RhoB activation using coverslips coated with the integrin ligand ICAM-1Fc.

Rearrangements of actin cytoskeleton including nucleation, elongation, stabilization, capping, crosslinking and depolymerization are tightly controlled by actin-binding-proteins (ABPs) (Pollard, 2016). In vitro studies of the biochemical functions of those ABPs in actin regulation provides insights in understanding the mechanism of actin network regulation. Here, we provide an easy understanding protocol which can be applied for actin cytoskeleton-related biochemistry experiments, including actin purification, pyrene actin assay. The protocol provides approaches to monitor the actin assembly with other actin-binding-proteins in vitro and help researchers to learn about the actin dynamics process under different conditions. This protocol provides a clear table template for users to prepare a reaction mixture. Complicated calculation steps are simplified. This protocol uses high throughput multi-well methods instead of cuvette measurements to provide higher throughput and good parallel comparison among samples.

In addition to its important role in stress responses (Howell, 2013; Bao et al., 2017; Bao and Howell, 2017), the UPR also participates in plant reproductive development, vegetative growth and root development (Deng et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018). There are two arms to the UPR in plants that employ three transcription factors: bZIP60, which is activated by IRE1 (Inositol Requiring 1) -mediated splicing of its mRNA (Deng et al., 2011), and bZIP17 and bZIP28, which are activated by S1P- and S2P-mediated cleavage of their membrane-localized proteins (Liu et al., 2007; Srivastava et al., 2013). All three transcription factors induce expression of downstream genes, including molecular chaperones such as BIP3 that assist in protein folding.
Bio-protocol-2031	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3100	Notochord Injury Assays that Stimulate Transcriptional Responses in Zebrafish Larvae	Zebrafish, Notochord, Tail fin, Injury, Amputation, Tissue repair, Tungsten wire, Nystatin Background The notochord is a transient embryonic structure that provides axial support and signaling information to the developing embryo (Ellis et al., 2013). It is comprised of two structurally distinct cell populations: the inner vacuolated cells that provide embryo support and structure, and the outer sheath cells that maintain turgor pressure for the vacuolated cells as well as patterning the developing vertebrate spine (Wopat et al., 2018; Lleras Forero et al., 2018; Figure 1A). We have recently discovered that wilms' tumor 7b(w t7b) is specifically expressed in a notochord sheath cell subpopulation that emerges at the site of damage and is maintained throughout repair and formation of adult vertebra structure in zebrafish (Figures 1B and 1C; Lopez-Baez et al., 2018). WT1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in mesodermal tissue development, adult tissue homeostasis, and becomes reactivated during epicardial tissue damage (Hastie et al., 2017). Our discovery that wt1b becomes expressed at the notochord wound may have important implications for the development of therapies for vertebrae spinal injuries or degenerative processes.

In 1977, maize ear rot swept through the state of Meghalaya, India. In 1988, maize ear rot was prevalent in the USA, and became a key biological control factor in maize production of African, resulting in a 48% reduction in maize yield (Vigier et al., 2001). Moreover, the infected maize ears also produced mycotoxins such as fumonisin and deoxynivalenol, which seriously threatened human and animals’ health (Gelderblom et al., 1988; Wild and Turner, 2002; Zhou et al., 2010).

The latter has been facilitated by the discovery of phalloidin, a small molecule toxin produced by poisonous mushrooms that stabilizes actin structures by specifically binding adjacent monomers within actin polymers (Vandekerckhove et al., 1985). Fluorescent phalloidin conjugates stain complex actin structures and facilitate detailed visualization by fluorescence microscopy. However, quantitating this fluorescence can be painstaking, particularly when tracing population-level changes. In contrast, flow cytometry quantitates the total fluorescence intensity of thousands of cells per minute.

Several studies have demonstrated recently that these microorganisms are important for maintaining host homeostasis. Indeed, changes in their composition can lead to dysbiosis, as observed in specific pathological conditions, and have been associated with their development, as shown for inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic inflammatory conditions (Ferreira et al., 2014; Nishida et al., 2018; Sokolowska et al., 2018).

This simple system involves the co-transfection of a plasmid encoding a GFP binding nanobody; a small, genetically encodable, single chain antibody (Kubala et al., 2010), fused to an ascorbate peroxidase APEX2-tag (Martell et al., 2012), which is able to catalyze a reaction to produce a precipitate visible in the electron microscope. More recently, we have expanded the scope of this methodology with i) the addition of an mCherry-binding nanobody allowing detection of mCherry-tagged proteins, ii) the adoption of conditionally stable nanobody sequences and iii) the application to bimolecular fluorescence complementation (Hu et al., 2002), allowing detection of pairwise interactions at the ultrastructural level (Ariotti et al., 2018).

Standardized or harmonized protocols are required to allow comparisons between research groups from around the world (e.g., Taylor et al., 2016; Lusher et al., 2017; Unger et al., 2017). Microplastics and mesoplastics (plastics generally < 1 mm and <5 mm respectively), as a form of marine litter, are now of major concern and have been included in international directives to monitor environmental health. Microplastics have been identified from surface waters to sediments, and from coastal areas to deep sea regions (Lusher, 2015); and, they might have physical and chemical effects on aquatic and terrestrial environments. Most worryingly, microplastics have been found in digestive tracts of aquatic organisms, including vertebrates (e.g., Tanaka and Takada, 2016; Karami et al., 2018). The presence of microplastics raises concern for cellular, individual level, food chain and ecosystem effects (Galloway et al., 2017).

The enrichment of a protein is of particular importance when analyzing lower abundant modified forms of it, as is usually the case for ubiquitylated forms of a protein. To be able to enrich for the ubiquitylated Fzo1 protein we tagged the protein with a Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and use anti-HA affinity beads to precipitate this modified protein from the solubilized membrane fraction. This allows for the detection of the less abundant ubiquitylated forms of proteins as for example Fzo1 (Anton et al., 2011 and 2013; Simoes et al., 2018).

HSC transplantation offers the best therapeutic cure for diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, and served as cellular platform to correct the mutation of genetic blood disease via gene targeting. There are several sources of hematopoietic stem cells, adult bone marrow-derived HSCs, cord blood-derived HSCs, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF)-mobilized HSCs. Compared with the bone marrow-derived HSCs, cord blood HSCs can tolerate more HLA mismatching, and have better anti-leukemia activities, and are more readily available. Unfortunately, the HSC transplantation is still a risky procedure to perform and transplant-related mortality is partially due to the leukemia relapse and/or the incidence of infections that took place during the recovery phase of HSC transplantation; all of which are attributable to the low stem cell numbers in the donor cord blood. Therefore, identifying cellular and molecular approaches that can help expand bona fide HSCs that maintain self-renewal activity is of pivotal translational significance.

Understanding how germ (reproductive) cells are able to give rise to offspring with each new generation has intrigued scientists, as well as the general public, for centuries. With recent advances in imaging techniques and tools, researchers have been able to observe oocytes (female germ cells) and sperm (male germ cells) in extraordinary detail, revealing fundamental mechanisms that allow germ cells to execute their specialized functions. Model organism research, in particular, has afforded the opportunity to combine live-animal imaging with genetic analyses to tease apart relevant biological pathways important for germ cell regulation. The nematode C. elegans, which exists as a hermaphrodite that continually self-fertilizes throughout young-adulthood (Klass, 1977), presents a powerful experimental system for studying important questions in reproductive biology. Recently, I utilized the C. elegans germline to explore how signs of aging are reversed from one generation to the next (Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017). These studies required the use of dyes to track various aspects of oocyte physiology, including lysosomal acidity and mitochondrial membrane potential. Unfortunately, dyes incubated with C. elegans in liquid culture were inefficient at penetrating the worm’s outer cuticle, which is highly-impervious (Page and Johnstone, 2007) and precludes robust staining. To circumvent this obstacle, I applied a dye-feeding approach (Hermann et al., 2005; Schaheen et al., 2006) in an attempt to stain and image intact, full germlines of live  .
Bio-protocol-2055	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3076	Eye Drops for Delivery of Bioactive Compounds and BrdU to Stimulate Proliferation and Label Mitotically Active Cells in the Adult Rodent Retina	BrdU, Eye drop delivery, Neurogenesis, Adult rodents, Retina, PNU-282987, Proliferation Background Although eye drop applications are not considered innovative, they are typically used to generate effects in the anterior portion of the eye (Patel et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2015). For instance, eye drop medications used in glaucoma patients decrease the production of aqueous humor or affect drainage of fluid through the trabecular meshwork in the anterior chamber of the eye (Dikopf et al., 2017). However, others have begun to use agents that are dissolved in vehicles to exert their effects in the back of the eye at the retina. For instance, the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide PACAP provides a well-established neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in the eye against different retinopathies. Although the route of delivery is usually intravitreal, a recent study that used PACAP dissolved in benzalkonium-chloride was able to cross the ocular barriers and exert protection in ischemic conditions (Werling et al., 2017). Other studies showed that the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor specific agonist, PNU-282987 (Bodnar et al., 2005; Hajos et al., 2005; Iwamoto et al., 2014), was able to cross ocular barriers and induce neurogenesis of adult mammalian neurons when delivered as eye drops, made by diluting a stock solution of PNU-282987 in lipophilic vehicle, DMSO, in PBS. (Webster et al., 2017). Previous dose and time-dependent studies showed that PNU-282987 was detectable in the retina by HPLC MS/MS after eye drop delivery. PNU-282987 levels were detected in the retina after topical application of the nAChR agonist to the bulbar conjunctiva (Mata et al., 2015).

Thus, with increasing lifespan in developed countries, cancer poses an increasing burden on healthcare systems. Most investigations rely on cancer cell lines, which have defined phenotypes and genotypes, are simple to maintain in the laboratory, and usually straightforward methods are established to manipulate them (e.g., introduce genes, silence genes…). However, cells do not exist as individuals in the body, they are an integral part of tissues, which are vascularized and composed of various cell types that make cell-cell contacts and exchange signaling molecules. Thus, tissues are evidently more representative and relevant models than individual cells to study cell biology and pathologies, such as cancer.

While many important factors are considered when characterizing enzyme kinetics, they ultimately all rely on a robust and accurate means of determining the rate of enzyme-catalyzed product formation under a series of carefully controlled conditions. One important and highly diverse class of enzymes includes those that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to downstream processes such as driving ion pumps, providing mechanical work, unfolding/folding proteins, and supporting otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable chemical reactions (Stock et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2016). Despite what processes these enzymes are ultimately responsible for, they are all collectively referred to as ATPases for the critical role ATP hydrolysis plays in their overall function.

Bio-protocol-2059	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3072	mRNA Stability Assay Using Transcription Inhibition by Actinomycin D	mRNA stability, Actinomycin D, mRNA decay, Transcription inhibitors, mRNA half-life Background Determining the stability of mRNA within cells provides an important measure for understanding post-transcriptional gene regulation and the potential role of RNA-protein interactions in the process. Under any specific condition such as following extracellular stimuli or gene knockdown the stability of mRNAs may change due to enhanced degradation or extended half-lives (Shyu et al., 1989). Therefore, to assess mRNA stability, direct measurements of decay rates of endogenous mRNAs have been performed in a number of ways, including kinetic labeling techniques and the use of transcriptional inhibitors (Chen et al., 2008). One of the simplest techniques of measuring mRNA stability is by inhibiting transcription in vivo with transcription inhibitors and measuring the mRNA kinetics.

SeV is a useful tool to study its infection and immune reaction (Fensterl et al., 2008; Chattopadhyay et al., 2010, 2011 and 2013; Yamashita et al., 2012a, 2012b and 2013; Veleeparambil et al., 2018) and the pathomechanism of a SeV-induced of IgA nephropathy (Yamashita et al., 2007; Chintalacharuvu et al., 2008). SeV is Precise viral quantification is essential to perform animal and cell culture experiments using an appropriate dose of SeV and also to obtain correct results from experimental samples containing SeV. In 1970s, SeV was quantitated by inoculation into embryonated eggs using hemagglutinin production as a criterion for infection (Shibuta et al., 1971). This method is highly sensitive but time consuming and complex.  Therefore,  a  kidney  cell-based  plaque  assay,  a  simple  and  reliable  assay  using hemadsorption (the attachment of red blood cells to the surface of cell monolayers infected with virus) has been developed (Jessen et al., 1987). This protocol provides a method for SeV PFU using LLC-MK2 cells (a rhesus monkey kidney cell lines) and Guinea pig red blood cells. This method can be applied for most types of samples including cell culture media, cell lysates, tissue homogenates, serum, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage.

When favorable condition comes, the bacterium enters inside the suitable host plant through root, grows, colonizes there and ultimately kills the plant. R. solanacearum strain (F1C1) had been isolated and characterized from a wilted chilli plant nearby Tezpur (Assam), north-east India (Kumar et al., 2013). Owing to the lethality and its exceptional wide host range, R. solanacearum considered as the second most devastating bacterial phytopathogen around the world (Mansfield et al., 2012). In spite of that, no effective approach so far is available to deal with this pathogen and its associated disease.

Bio-protocol-2069	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3062	H1N1 Virus Production and Infection	Influenza A virus, Infected mouse model, H1N1, Virus production, Plaque assay Background Influenza A virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, is a negative-sense RNA virus with eight segmented genomes of single-stranded viral RNAs (vRNAs) that encode more than 10 proteins. During the past 100 years, outbreaks of influenza-virus strains regularly appeared in human populations, including “Spanish flu” in 1918 caused by the H1N1 subtype, “Asian flu” in 1957 by H2N2, “Hong Kong flu” in 1968 by H3N2, “Russian flu” in 1977 by H1N1, and “swine flu” in 2009 by H1N1 (Smith et al., 2009; Lim and Mahmood, 2011; Kumar et al., 2018). Seasonal influenza A viruses also circulate worldwide, spread easily from person to person, and result in the hospitalization of three to five million individuals worldwide annually (Molinari et al., 2007). The seasonal influenza infections are responsible for 290,000-650,000 deaths annually, mainly among young children, elderly adults, and critically ill patients (Kumar et al., 2018).

Alcohol induces positive reinforcement, and animals can seek alcohol and even work for it. However, alcohol can also be a negative reinforcement, since it is capable of reducing anxiety. No animal model is able to duplicate the complex features of alcoholism. Oral ethanol self-administration is widely used for examining specific aspects of behavior and physiology relevant for understanding alcoholism (Mardones and Segovia-Riquelme, 1983; Cunningham et al., 2000). Mice can be genetically manipulated at cell type specific levels and therefore are valuable for research into the cell type specific genetic determinants of alcoholism.

In this field, virus inoculation is the essential and reliable method to evaluate the resistance of a transgenic material or a rice variety. Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) can transmit rice ragged stunt disease by brown planthopper in a persistent propagative manner in many Asian countries (Ling et al., 1978; Hibino, 1979). Two classical methods, including single seedling inoculation and group inoculation, had been applied to conduct virus inoculation experiments (Zhang et al., 2013). By modifying traditional group inoculation method, we provided a convenient approach which closely resembles the natural infection condition.
Bio-protocol-2072	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3059	Pneumatic Method to Measure Plant Xylem Embolism	Embolism resistance, Plant drought stress, Hydraulic failure, Plant pneumatics Background Plant xylem embolizes due to the entry of air into the xylem vessels under drought conditions. Resistance to embolism formation is one of the most important plant traits strongly determining species distribution, mortality and evolution (Choat et al., 2012; Rowland et al., 2015; Larter et al., 2017) and has been recently suggested as a key trait to model plant function and predict plant responses to global changes (Sperry and Love, 2015; Brodribb, 2017). Most methods used to estimate embolism resistance measures the hydraulic conductivity of embolized branch segments and relate it to the hydraulic conductance of the branch segment without embolism (Sperry et al., 1988; Melcher et al., 2012). These methods are usually time-consuming and prone to several artifacts (Wheeler et al., 2013; Trifilò et al., 2014; Beikircher and Mayr, 2016).

Bio-protocol-2078	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3053	Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Fractionation of Proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans Alejandro Mata-Cabana1, Olga Sin2, 3, Renée I. Seinstra4 and Ellen A. A. Nollen4, *	C. elegans, Subcellular fractionation, Protein localization, Nucleus, Cytoplasm, Immunoblot Background Subcellular fractionation has been used in different model organisms to identify and study protein function in nuclei, membranes and cytoplasm. For example, aggregation-prone proteins may be more toxic when they are localized in the nucleus or in the cytosol (Kontopoulos et al., 2006; Barmada et al., 2010). Here we provide a protocol (adapted from Chen et al., 2000 and La Rocca et al., 2007) to localize specific proteins in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of C. elegans.
Bio-protocol-2079	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3052	Generation of Gene Knockout and Gene Replacement with Complete Removal of Full-length Endogenous Transcript Using CRISPR-Trap	CRISPR, CRISPR-Trap, Gene knockout, Gene replacement, Gene editing, hiPSCs Background The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology facilitated the genomic targeting for the generation of gene knockouts and gene editing. The conventional method to perform a knockout relies on the introduction of a frameshift leading to premature termination codons (PTCs), truncating the open reading frame (ORF) and subsequent degradation of the transcript of the targeted gene by nonsensemediated mRNA decay (NMD). A possible pitfall of this approach is full-length transcripts which may escape NMD and give rise to C-terminal truncated proteins harboring residual or even dominant negative functions. This protocol presents the CRISPR-Trap, a method we recently established (Reber et al., 2018), which upon successful editing will prevent the expression of any full-length transcript from the target gene locus (Figure 1). Simply put, this approach targets the first intron of the gene of interest with CRISPR/Cas9. Using homology-directed repair (HDR) a customizable cassette flanked by a strong acute3 -splice site and a strong polyadenylation signal is introduced in the first intron, thereby generating an artificial second and effectively last exon. Since transcription is terminated by the introduced polyadenylation signal, only the first endogenous exon and the inserted cassette is transcribed. The customizable cassette can be used to introduce a selection marker, thereby enabling easy selection for at least heterozygous edited clones. If a gene replacement is wanted, the customizable cassette can be used to introduce the replacement gene, followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and a selection marker (Reber et al., 2016 and 2018).

This process is termed transcytosis (Garcia-Castillo et al., 2017). The absorption and secretion of immunoglobulins by receptormediated endocytosis and vesicular transport across the mucosa of the alimentary and respiratory tracts most famously typifies this process. Interest in transcytosis is also stimulated by the potential to harness this pathway for the delivery of therapeutic peptides and proteins across tight epithelial and endothelial barriers (Thuenauer et al., 2017).

In plants, autophagy is induced by several stress conditions including starvation, oxidative stress, salt stress and senescence (Doelling et al., 2002; Hanaoka et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2005; Bassham, 2007; Liu and Bassham, 2009; Luo et al., 2017). During autophagy, double-membrane vesicles named autophagosomes form in cytoplasm and transport into the central vacuole, where the outer membrane of autophagosomes fuses with vacuolar membrane. Then the single-membrane structure termed as autophagic body enters into the vacuole lumen and ultimately gets degraded (Ohsumi, 2001; Liu and Bassham, 2012).

Bio-protocol-2088	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3043	Purification of Soluble Recombinant Human Tau Protein from Bacteria	Tau, MAPT, Protein purification, Soluble Tau, Recombinant Tau, Alzheimer’s Background Tau is traditionally defined as a microtubule binding protein; however, in human diseases Tau can dissociate from axonal microtubules and mislocalize to other neuronal compartments including the soma, dendrites, and synapses, where interactions with non-microtubule proteins and structures drive neuronal dysfunction (Iqbal et al., 2016; Wang and Mandelkow, 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; McInnes et al., 2018). Although Tau aggregates in the form of neurofibrillary tangles are commonly found in postmortem diseased brain tissue, studies suggest that soluble Tau, not aggregated Tau, is largely responsible for neuronal dysfunction (Crimins et al., 2012; Polydoro et al., 2014; Koss et al., 2016). As such, investigating the soluble functions of Tau in disease, such as identifying protein-protein interaction partners, is therefore of critical importance to target Tau dysfunction.

Bio-protocol-2091	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3040	Maintenance of Schmidtea mediterranea in the Laboratory	Planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, Culture, Planarium, Model organism, Regeneration Background Planarians are bilaterally symmetric platyhelminthes, members of the superphylum lophotrochozoa. There are terrestrial, marine, and freshwater planarians. They prey predominantly upon  injured  insects,  insect  larvae,  and  other  invertebrates.  Planarians  are  triploblastic  and acoelomated animals that lack circulatory, skeletal, and respiratory systems (Figure 1A). These animals have the amazing ability to restore any missing part of their body after an amputation in a few days (Reddien and Alvarado, 2004; Salo, 2006); and to grow and degrow depending of the environmental conditions and food availability (Baguñá and Romero, 1981). These characteristics are due to the presence of an adult stem cell population – called neoblasts – that is able to give rise to any planarian cell type (Reddien and Alvarado, 2004; Salo, 2006). The high regenerative capacity of planarians, with the presence of a unique totipotent stem cell system, provides an ideal model for studying cell renewal, regeneration, and stem cell regulation. Schmidtea mediterranea is the most common planarian species used in molecular biology to perform molecular and cellular studies, because it presents special features that optimize research. For instances, they are easily maintained as a stable clonal line in the laboratory due to their robust ability to regenerate, which allows a uniform genetic background and minimizes the experimental variability. Here we detail the protocol used in our laboratory to maintain the planarian species Schmidtea mediterranea.
Bio-protocol-2092	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3039	Detection of Cell Death in Planarians	Caspase-3 activity, TUNEL assay, Planarians, Cell death, Cell turnover Background Cell renewal in adult organisms is a complex mechanism based on three processes: (a) the elimination of selected cells by cell death; (b) the replacement of eliminated cells through cell division, typically involving adult stem cells and their descendants; and (c) the differentiation of newly generated cells and their integration with preexisting tissue (Pellettieri and Sanchez Alvarado, 2007; GonzálezEstévez and Saló, 2010). In planarians, cell renewal must be continuously coordinated, since they grow and degrow depending on food availability and temperature(Baguñá and Romero, 1981). It is known that the changes in size result mainly from changes in cell number, rather than in cell size, so the ratio of dying/proliferating cells is controlled by environmental conditions (González-Estévez and Saló, 2010). Planarians are able to tolerate long starvation periods, and during this time, they degrow up to minimum sizes. Under these stressful conditions, food reserves from gastrodermis and mesenchyma are the firsts to be used, and at more extreme points, the sexual strains digest the sexual organs, and become asexual (González-Estévez and Saló, 2010; Miller and Newmark, 2012). When food is available, planarians are able to grow back, and in the sexual strains, the reproductive organs reappear. These cycles of grow and degrow occur throughout planarian lives without damage to the animal.

Endurance training has potent effects on cardiovascular function, energy metabolism, and mobility which are highly conserved from flies to humans (Piazza et al., 2009; Booth et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2015). A better understanding of genetic mediators of exercise may lead to therapeutics that can benefit individuals that are unable to exercise due to illness or injury. Drosophila is a well-equipped model organism to help identify genetic mediators of exercise due to its short lifespan, easily modifiable genetics, and well-defined exercise response (Piazza et al., 2009).
Bio-protocol-2095	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3036	An Image Analysis Pipeline to Quantify Emerging Cracks in Materials or Adhesion Defects in Living Tissues	Cracks, Cell adhesion, Image analysis, Mechanical properties, Tension, Github Background Microcracks are present in most materials; their number and extent generally increase when repeated stress is applied or when the temperature fluctuates, causing material fatigue and eventually, failure. Microcracks can reveal the magnitude and direction of the principal stresses that the material is experiencing. This property is widely used in mechanical engineering and geology (e.g., Kowallis and Wang, 1983; Kranz, 1983; Joseph et al., 2002). Microcracks are also present in biological structures, like bones. As in any material, they can lead to rupture (fatigue fracture). Such cracks also trigger signaling cascades involving osteoblasts and osteoclasts, resulting in bone remodeling (e.g., Mori and Burr, 1993). Cracks can also be observed in soft tissues, notably as a result of cell to cell adhesion defects. This is particularly obvious in plant tissues, where cells do not migrate or intercalate (e.g., Bouton et al., 2002). Although many tools have been developed to study cracks in material sciences, they are often adapted to analyze long and thin cracks (e.g., Griffiths et al., 2017); they have not been customized for the analysis of emerging cracks in soft biological tissues. Here we describe a pipeline that detects and analyzes such cracks.

Proteins with a SUMO conjugation consensus site, K E (  is a hydrophobic residue, followed by a lysine, any amino acid, and glutamic acid), can be efficiently modified by one or several of the SUMO paralogs expressed in mammals, including SUMO1, SUMO2 or SUMO3 (collectively referred to as SUMO2/3, due to their 97% sequence homology) (Gareau and Lima, 2010; Flotho and Melchior, 2013). SUMO is also reversibly removed by the activity of SUMO isopeptidases, or SENPs (Mukhopadhyay and Dasso, 2007; Hickey et al., 2012). Although the dynamic cycling between conjugation and deconjugation can result in a relatively low steady-state level of a modified protein, SUMO modification nonetheless produces profound effects on substrate function in a variety of cellular pathways.
Bio-protocol-2099	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3032	Isolation and Culture of Mouse Lung ILC2s	Innate immunity, Allergic inflammation, ILC2, IL-33, Type 2 cytokine, Lung, Culture Background Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) are tissue resident cells that play crucial roles in anti-parasitic innate immunity as well as in the development of allergic inflammation. They respond to epithelial cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin-33 (IL-33) by producing large amounts of type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, which in turn induce eosinophilia and mucus production (Cayrol and Girard, 2018). In order to better characterize the function and regulation of these cells, numerous groups have sorted ILC2s from the lung of wild-type mice (WT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Due to the low number of the ILC2s present in the lungs at steady state, this method results in a low yield of purified cells ( 1×10^4 per mouse) (for a review, see Moro et al., 2015). In the present protocol, we pretreat mice with IL-33, which triggers the in vivo expansion of lung ILC2s, resulting in a better yield of purified cells 1.3×10^6 per mouse). Moreover, we use Rag2-/- mice instead of WT mice because 1) the absence of B and T cells in these mice facilitates the purification of ILC2s, and 2) the number of ILC2s is greater in these mice. Culture of the isolated Lin-CD 45^+ cell population for a couple of days ex vivo provides highly purified lung ILC2s without the need to use a cell sorter. In summary, the procedure we describe is highly reproducible and provides abundant highly purified mouse lung ILC2s.
Bio-protocol-2100	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3031	Real-time PCR Analysis of PAMP-induced Marker Gene Expression in Nicotiana benthamiana	PAMPs, PTI, Real-time PCR, Nicotiana benthamiana, Defense-related marker gene Background Pathogen-associated molecular patterns, namely PAMPs, are a class of molecules derived from pathogens and are relatively conserved across microorganisms. Multiple PAMPs such as flg22 and XEG1 (Felix et al., 1999; Ma et al., 2015), have been characterized that can be detected by plant cell surface localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and thereby induce PAMP-triggered immunity (Couto and Zipfel, 2016). One of the predominant PAMP-triggered responses is the activation of defense-related maker genes (Navarro et al., 2004; Zipfel et al., 2006). Nicotiana benthamiana has been used extensively as a model plants and is sensitive to multiple PAMPs. In N. benthamiana, the marker genes, such as NbCYP71D20, NbACRE31 and NbWRKY22, were previously found that are rapidly activated upon PAMP treatment (Heese et al., 2007; Segonzac et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2018). Here, we describe a detailed protocol for checking the PAMP-triggered marker gene expression in N. benthamiana. The relative gene expression was also determined in parallel using a negative control to exclude the background noise.

One of the rapidly growing fields, is the use of zebrafish as a model for cancer biology research. Zebrafish mate efficiently and reliably, and can produce lots of offspring that are small, transparent, develop externally and can be cultured easily in e.g., multi-well plates (White et al., 2013). Interestingly, human tumor cells can be implanted into zebrafish embryo and many of these xenografts are able to faithfully recapitulate their malignant behavior by growing, invading and metastasizing in the embryo (Lee et al., 2005; Nicoli et al., 2007; Chapman et al., 2014). Zebrafish has also become a highly tractable model system for molecular studies on vascular development, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and helped us to improve our understanding of vascular disease in humans (Hogan and Schulte-Merker, 2017). The possibility to visualize both blood and lymphatic vasculature using live imaging techniques makes zebrafish suitable for investigating tumor cell dissemination and metastasis from the primary site (Hogan and SchulteMerker, 2017). As compared to mouse xenografts, the zebrafish embryo xenograft experiments require lower costs, smaller numbers of tumor cells and are faster to carry out.

Bio-protocol-2107	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3024	Artificial Inhalation Protocol in Adult Mice	Inhalation, Olfaction, Nasopharynx, Respiration, Tracheotomy Background Olfaction, aerosolized drug delivery, and many facets of airway humidification and homeostasis are governed by active respiration through the nasal passages. Basic research into these areas benefits from being able to actively control respiration in an anesthetized preparation. Our lab focuses in part on how active respiration controls olfactory coding in the olfactory bulb, which is the site of the first synapse in the neurobiology of odor perception. To address questions along this front in anesthetized mice, we employ an artificial respiration strategy that decouples airflow through the nasal passages from gas exchange with the lungs. This type of preparation allows experimentally manipulating nasal airflow while simultaneously delivering oxygenated air (usually incorporating a dilute aerosolized general anesthetic) to the lungs, thus producing a stable in vivo preparation that can last for eight hours or more.
Bio-protocol-2108	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3023	Behavioral Evaluation of Odor Memory in Mice	Memory, Olfactory, Behaviour, Spontaneous, Novelty, Context Background When presented with a novel and familiar odor, mice behaviorally express memory for the familiar odor by spending a greater proportion of time investigating the unknown stimulus (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988). Previously encountered odors can also instigate an increase in investigation if it is found in a novel position in space or temporal sequence (Mitchell and Laiacona, 1998; Eacott and Norman, 2004; Dere et al., 2005; Hunsaker et al., 2008; Barker et al., 2017; Aqrabawi and Kim, 2018). This sensitivity to the contextual information associated with an odor can be useful for evaluating different aspects of memory which may manifest from unique neural substrates. This is particularly useful when investigating with animal models of memory disorders where one form of memory is affected to a greater extent. Notably, none of the behavioral paradigms require extensive training and can be easily modified to suit experimental needs.

Bio-protocol-2110	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3021	Activation of Fibroblast Contractility via Cell-Cell Interactions and Soluble Signals	Collagen contraction, Fibroblast, Mast cell, Collagen lattice/hydrogel, Fibrosis Background Tissue contraction and remodeling of the extracellular matrix are essential processes in numerous physiological conditions such as wound healing. Central to these two phenomena are fibroblasts, which not only produce and secrete the extracellular matrix proteins but can also reorganize them through mechanical interactions. Interestingly, these cellular behaviors are often exaggerated in pathological conditions such as fibrosis (Desmoulière et al., 2005), thereby illustrating the need to understand the molecular regulation of these processes. Though it has long been known that collagen, one of the main components of the extracellular matrix, is a major player in tissue contraction (Bell et al., 1979), a thorough understanding of the mechanistic details of this process remain elusive. The study of the contraction of fibroblast populated collagen matrices in vitro has enabled researchers to identify novel players which bring about tissue contraction (Ngo et al., 2006; Su and Chen, 2015). Based on this assay, soluble factors such as T G F (Levi-Schaffer et al., 1999) and those from immune cells (Garbuzenko et al., 2002; Zagai et al., 2004) have been identified as major factors affecting fibroblast activity. To a large extent, relative to soluble extracellular signals, the contribution of cell-cell interactions on the contractile ability of fibroblasts has been understudied. Recently, we have shown that an important player regulating fibroblast-mediated contraction is the heterotypic cell-cell interactions with immune cells such as mast cells (Pincha et al., 2018). In this protocol, we provide a method to use this assay to determine the effect of cell-cell interactions on matrix contraction. In doing so, we have elaborated upon previously published protocols (Ngo et al., 2006; Su and Chen, 2015) and provide simple alternatives to setting up the assay and the subsequent analysis of the gels. This protocol can also be modified to recapitulate the native/in vivo environments of diverse cell types to assay their regulation within their “normal” microenvironment.
Bio-protocol-2111	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3020	Qualitative in vivo Bioluminescence Imaging	Bioluminescence, Tumor imaging, Luciferase Imaging, Metastasis, Ovarian cancer Background The principle of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is based on the light-emitting properties of a relatively simple biochemical process, i.e., luciferase-mediated oxidation of the molecular substrate luciferin to produce light. In cancer research, BLI is a popular tool (Contag et al., 2000) used to study the metastatic spread of luciferase-transduced cancer cells in live animals in vivo. Most animal tissues have little to no baseline bioluminescent properties, which ensures that there is a very high signal to noise ratio in BLI experiments. Nevertheless, it is always pragmatic to ensure that BLI experiments are conducted with non-substrate injected rodents as a negative control group. A few crucial factors are key to ensuring best practice in performing BLI experiments on rodents for the detection of luciferase-tagged cancer cells. Firstly, BLI is a powerful tool that allows easy detection of luciferase expressing-cells by imaging emitted bioluminescence under anesthesia (Figure 1). However, this technique is essentially qualitative and attempts to quantitate BLI signal can be misleading given that the strength of signal is dependent on several factors including duration of exposure, anesthetic technique, time elapsed after injecting luciferin, etc. Moreover, published evidence indicates that light emission (i.e., quantity of photons) is not directly related to luciferase activity (Rice et al., 2001). Secondly, the location or depth of the tissue of interest, particularly its distance from the skin’s surface, and the size of the metastatic cell mass are important considerations in planning a BLI experiment (Weissleder, 2001). This is because photon loss occurs as the signal travels through the tissue mass–consequently, luciferase-tagged cells/tissues that are closer to the skin’s surface tend to appear brighter as do larger metastases.

Approximately 750 billion platelets circulate in human blood, constantly scanning the vasculature for damage of the endothelial surface. Upon encountering endothelial injury, platelets are immediately recruited in a wellcharacterized cascade of events including initial platelet tethering and rolling, followed by platelet activation, adhesion and spreading, eventually leading to fibrin (ogen)-dependent aggregation and subsequent thrombus retraction (Jackson, 2007). Platelet plug formation is a major step in physiological hemostasis, but also in pathological thrombosis after atherosclerotic plaque rupture, triggering myocardial infarction or stroke (Jackson, 2011).

Kava contains a group of lipophilic compounds called kavalactones, which are believed to be responsible for the sedative, anxiolytic, and other therapeutic effects of the drink (Rowe et al., 2011; Savage et al., 2015; Kautu et al., 2017). Here, we provide a protocol to examine the effects of kavalactones on neuromuscular activity, using C. elegans as a model system (Kautu et al., 2017). In our assay, we showed that administration of aqueous kavalactone solution induced epileptic-like convulsions and paralysis in a dose-responsive manner. These manifestations are suggestive of the modulatory actions of kavalactones on the neuromuscular junction. Thus, our protocol could provide important insight into the neurophysiological actions of kavalactones.
Bio-protocol-2124	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3007	Classic Labyrinth Test for Neurobehavioral Evaluation in Wistar Rats	Classic labyrinth, Behavior, Learning, Drugs, Pesticides, Rats Background We set out to elucidate how animals memorize and learn when they are challenged with stress utilizing the classical labyrinth test. The CLT is performed in a square-shaped plastic enclosure 125×125×40cm_i ) with several labyrinth passages of identical width and height (25×35c m) , but with variable length (Figure 1). Usually, this labyrinth is placed on a table 90 cm high. Control rats can quickly move through the labyrinth between the starting point and the ending point. When the animal explores the maze, it increases the time it spends in the maze's passages, which will be considered as aversive or anxiety-provoking for the stressed animal; while the leak behavior will be observed when the animal spends more time in the starting point or corners, which will be associated with a refuge (Leo and Pamplona, 2014; Gasmi et al., 2017b). There are many tests similar to this test, but this test is unique because it is concerned with measuring the impact of environmental pollutants on the behavior and psychology of animals, especially rats (Serchov et al., 2016). Some advantages of this approach are that this test is inexpensive, and it is quick; the test usually takes about 10 min, and after cleaning the labyrinth with 70% ethanol, it can be used to test the next animal (Gasmi et al., 2017a and 2018).
Bio-protocol-2125	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3006	Studying the Mechanisms of Developmental Vocal Learning and Adult Vocal Performance in Zebra Finches through Lentiviral Injection	Zebra finch, Area X, miR-9, Lentivirus, Song learning, Song performance Background The zebra finch, with its well-characterized song behavior and the underlying neural circuitry, provides a unique animal model to study neural mechanisms underlying vocal communication and related sensory-motor learning. In recent years, several laboratories began using viral vectors to manipulate gene expression in the zebra finch brain and to study the functional consequences. These efforts are best illustrated by studies of the FoxP2 gene, which encodes the forkhead box p2 transcription factor. The FoxP2 protein controls the expression of hundreds of downstream genes that have important roles in nervous system development. Mutations in the human FoxP2 gene cause speech and language impairments (Lai et al., 2001). In songbirds, knockdown or overexpression of the FoxP2 gene in Area X of zebra finches, a basal ganglia nucleus critical for vocal learning, profoundly impairs song behavior (Haesler et al., 2007; Murugan et al., 2013; Heston and White, 2015). These studies significantly extended the usage of the zebra finch model to study gene functions in neural circuit development, vocal communication behavior, as well as in speech and language-related neural developmental disorders. We recently reported that overexpression of miRNA miR-9 in Area X of juvenile zebra finches impairs song learning and performance (Shi et al., 2018). Hoping others might benefit from this study, here we provide step-by-step protocols for lentivirus cloning and production, stereotaxic injection of the virus into Area X of juveniles, and analysis of the impact of miR-9 overexpression on song learning and performance using the software Sound Analysis Pro (Tchernichovski et al., 2000). With minor modifications, these methods can be tailored to study other miRNAs or genes in vocal learning and performance in songbirds.

Ethylene plays important roles in rice growth, development, and environmental adaptation, including coleoptile and shoot elongation, aerenchyma development, and submergence response (Xu et al., 2006; Fukao and Bailey-Serres, 2008; Ma et al., 2010). Rice may have a distinct mechanism of ethylene-signaling pathway due to the different ethylene-regulated biological processes in rice and Arabidopsis (Yang et al., 2015a). The forward genetic analysis is essential to reveal fully the mechanism of ethylene signaling pathway in rice. So, it is prerequisite to develop an efficient method to screen ethylene-response mutants in rice. Genetic screens that are based on the triple-response have been extensively conducted on Arabidopsis (Johnson and Ecker, 1998; Stepanova and Ecker, 2000). However, the genetic screens in rice have been hamper owing to the lack of ethylene-response phenotypes.

The study of miRNAs has boosted the evolution of numerous biochemical and computational techniques that unravel new mechanisms and networks applicable to clinical scenarios. These high-throughput procedures include profiling methods (microarrays and NGS), in vivo target validation and single-molecule imaging (Steinkraus et al., 2016). In contrast, functional reporters that directly assess miRNA-target repression have been kept simple and with low resolution.

Apart from causing a huge yield loss of cereals, this fungus also produces mycotoxins which affect human and animal health. Therefore, this fungus has received extensive attention, and ranked the fourth among all investigated plant pathogenic fungi (Dean et al., 2012).

To build multicellular organism, cell duplication is necessary to generate specialized cells, which can execute particular function. The normal cell cycle is composed of interphase (G1, S and G2 phase) and mitotic (M) phase (Rodríguez-Ubreva et al., 2010; Léger et al., 2016). During interphase, the genetic materials are duplicated and make everything ready for mitosis. Whereas, during mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter cells (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008).
Bio-protocol-2138	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2993	Enzymatic Assays and Enzyme Histochemistry of	Tuta absoluta, Trypsin, Papain, Cryostat, Histochemistry Background Plants and insects have coexisted for million years and evolved a set of interactions which affect both organisms at different levels. Insects manage to develop different physiological and morphological adaptations to overcome plants defense mechanisms. Therefore, a better understanding of their vital functions would facilitate their targeted control. Different physiological functions in insects rely on enzymes: digestive, respiratory, circulatory, muscular, nervous, reproductive and endocrine. Several enzymes participate in the digestion. Proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin or carboxypeptidases are responsible for protein digestion, which is a source of amino acids for the insect. Thus, digestive protease inhibitors have been successfully used to improve plant resistance to insects (Smigocki et al., 2013; Quilis et al., 2014; Hamza et al., 2018). In order to design such approaches, it is important to identify the target insect digestive enzymes. Enzyme histochemistry is a useful method for the localization of active enzymes in tissue sections of an organism. However, few protocols have been described for insects. One of the main issues of this method is the sensibility of the enzymes to fixatives. In a previous study, Erban and Hubert (2011) visualized the digestive enzymes in the body of the acarid mite Lepidoglyphus destructor after feeding them with chromogenic and fluorescent substrates taking advantage of their transparent body. This approach is not suitable for larvae of bigger insects such as Tuta absoluta. These larvae do not have transparent body allowing the visualization of the fluorescence and are reared with fresh tomato leaves instead of artificial diet and thus cannot be supplemented with enzymatic substrates. In our work, we designed a protocol for the detection of serine proteases and papain-like proteases in cryosections of larvae of Tuta absoluta without tissue fixation. We also quantified these enzymes in larvae at different instars using chromogenic substrates.
Bio-protocol-2139	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2992	Analysis of the Effect of Sphingomyelinase on Rubella	Rubella virus, Lipid, Sphingomyelin, Virus entry, Sphingomyelinase Background Rubella virus (RuV) is a positive-strand RNA virus and belongs to the genus Rubivirus in the family Togaviridae. The family has two genera, Rubivirus and Alphavirus. RuV is the sole member of genus Rubivirus, whereas many viruses, such as Semliki forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are classified in the genus alphavirus. RuV is the causative agent of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella is characterized by low-grade fever, a morbilliform rash, and lymphadenopathy. It is ordinarily a mild disease. However, CRS is a serious disease. CRS causes multiple organ defects in neonates born from mothers who suffered from rubella during the early phase of their pregnancy. Cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss and cardiovascular defects are common in CRS.
Bio-protocol-2140	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2991	Investigating Neural Stem Cell and Glioma Stem Cell Self-renewal Potential Using Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA)	Stem cells, Glioma, Glioblastoma, Neural stem cells, Neurospheres, Self-renewal, ELDA Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common types of brain cancer with an extremely poor prognosis (Kaye and Morokoff, 2014). GBM treatment success or failure is determined by a complex biology due to the underlying genetics and epigenetics which regulate many signal transduction pathways, which in turn govern pro-oncogenic tumor cell behaviors and ultimately response/resistance to treatments. One of the major pathways regulating GBM cell behavior involves hyperactivation of PI3K signaling due mutations involving one or more pathway factors including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the PI3K catalytic subunit encoded by the PIK3CA gene and deletion of the PI3K pathway negative regulator and tumor suppressor, Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) (Mantamadiotis, 2017). Using a genetically engineered mouse model, our recent study demonstrated that PI3K mutations, specifically targeting the Pik3ca and Pten genes in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPs) can trigger the development of aggressive brain tumors, in vivo (Daniel et al., 2017 and 2018). In vitro analysis of NSCs isolated from mutant and wild-type mice revealed intrinsic cellular differences between genotypes, including sphere forming potential, which is a correlate of stem cell potential. This protocol describes the method used to investigate neural stem cell potential via established and variations on established methods. Extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) can be used to analyze stem cell self-renewal ability and has been widely used in the stem cell field (Shackleton et al., 2006; Quintana et al., 2008; Vaillant et al., 2008). Subtle differences between NSCs or GSCs can be quantified by ELDA using a freely available webtool (Hu and Smyth, 2009). Moreover, we present a variation in stem  cell  potential  analysis  by  including  an  intermediate  differentiation  step  between  ELDA measurements, which revealed more substantial differences in sphere forming potential between mutant and wild-type mouse NSCs, compared to performing ELDA alone, with cells which had not undergone forced differentiation. The forced differentiation step measures the inherent stability of NSCs and GBMlike NSCs, which maintain neurosphere forming potential following differentiation; stability which may correlate with faster disease relapse/recurrence following therapy.

They constitute the fundamental units of brain circuitry that enable execution of complex behaviors. The arrival of an action potential causes calcium influx via voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in depolarization of the plasma membrane. Upon this pre-synaptic depolarization, synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft via a highly controlled process (Sudhof, 1995; Sudhof, 2004).

Molecular mechanisms of pathogen recognition and immune signaling pathways have been intensively studied over the past decades. However, how plant immunity affects pathogen metabolism to inhibit pathogen growth is scarcely understood often because of the difficulty in profiling pathogen responses in planta. In case of bacterial pathogens, transcriptome profiling inside plant leaves is difficult to study because the amount of bacterial mRNA is much lower than that of plants; and it is particularly challenging at an early stage of infection due to the low population density of bacteria in plants. To overcome this limitation, we established a method for isolating bacteria from the infected plant leaves and profiling bacterial transcriptome with RNA-Seq. This method has been successfully used for profiling the transcriptome of the model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in various conditions (Nobori et al., 2018).

We used newborn mice for isolation of brain endothelial cells using anti-CD31 antibody. With this protocol, 2u of total RNA which is suitable for gene expression analysis can be isolated from brain endothelial cells, although pericytes and astrocytes cannot be totally eliminated. We also used 3-month-old mice lung to isolate lung endothelial cells using anti-CD31 and anti-CD102 antibodies. Isolated lung endothelial cells were expanded in vitro in 6 cm dish and used for various downstream experiments such as gene expression analysis and cell-based signaling assay.

Kidney damage can arise from a wide range of insults including infections, ischemia, toxins, hypertension, genetic and metabolic disorders (Imig and Ryan, 2013). The immediate response to insult functionally is acute kidney injury (AKI), a clinical syndrome characterised  physiologically  by  a  rapid  (hours  to  days)  decrease  in  kidney  function  and histomorphologically by infiltration of inflammatory immune cells into the renal tubulointerstitium, the tissue compartment adjoining the tubules of the kidney (Basile et al., 2012). The subsequent biological responses aim to limit ongoing injury and repair damaged tissue. If unresolved, this inflammation may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is defined as a loss in kidney function that persists for at least 3 months in duration and is characterized histomorphologically, regardless of its cause, by tubulointerstitial  fibrosis  and  chronic  inflammation  (Kawakami  et  al.,  2014).  The  presence  of inflammatory immune cells in human AKI and CKD is suggestive of functional roles in disease progression. However, the identification and enumeration of these C D45^+ leukocyte populations in human kidney tissue remain poorly defined.
Bio-protocol-2152	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2979	Studying the Role of Microglia in Neurodegeneration and Axonal Regeneration in the Murine Visual System	Axon regeneration, Neurodegeneration, Microglia, Microglia depletion, PLX5622, CSF1R Background Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), which continuously scan their environment for pathologic alterations (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005). Upon detection of such conditions, microglia transform into an activated state and migrate towards the source where they perform different tasks (Kreutzberg, 1996; Davalos et al., 2005). Pathologic alterations, such as neurodegenerative diseases or acute injuries, are associated with neuronal loss and phagocytosis of these dying cells by activated microglia. Therefore, the overall assumption is that microglia are involved in this process (Thanos, 1991; Davalos et al., 2005; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007). Besides a possible effect of microglia on dying neurons, microglia are also part of the glial scar, which is formed at the lesion site and impairs axon regeneration in the CNS (Silver, 2004; Kitayama et al., 2011). However, as a clear discrimination of infiltrated blood born macrophages and microglia in the injured nerve was not feasible, the specific role of microglia in glial scar formation and axonal regeneration remained elusive (Silver, 2004; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007; Prinz and Priller, 2014; Hilla et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2153	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2978	CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing of a Large DNA Virus: African Swine Fever Virus	ASFV, African swine fever, ASF, CRISPR, CRISPR/Cas9 Background African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly lethal contagious viral disease of swine caused by ASF virus (ASFV). The genome of ASFV consists of a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 180-190 kilobase pairs. ASFV causes a spectrum of disease, from highly lethal to sub-clinical, depending on host characteristics and the virus strain (Tulman et al., 2009). There is no commercial vaccine for ASFV; experimentally, the only vaccines that have shown to protect against the current circulating strain from the outbreak in Georgia in 2007 (ASFV-G) are live attenuated vaccines that contain one or more deletions to the viral genome, for example: (O' Donnell et al., 2015). Traditionally, gene deletions for ASFV have been performed by homologous recombination where a donor plasmid containing homologous genomic sequences is used for gene deletion (O' Donnell et al., 2015), however this only occurs at a very low rate, making production of recombinant ASFV difficult (Borca et al., 2018). Recently we reported the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as an alternative approach to introduce gene deletions in ASFV, with a 4 log increase over traditional methods (Borca et al., 2018). This increase, in recombination using CRISPR/Cas9, allows for easier production and purification of recombinant viruses from the parental wild-type. It is possible that using CRISPR/Cas9 will allow for viral protein mutations, expanding our abilities to dissect critical domains for virulence, possibly even in genes that have been previously determined to be essential. This approach has successfully been reported with other large

Naturally, studies of pollen biology are also essential for understanding plant fertility and reproductive development. However, a simple and reliable method for germinating pollen from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and sustaining rapid, morphologically normal pollen tube growth in vitro has been frustratingly elusive. Prior to developing our own method (Rodriguez-Enriquez et al., 2013), described here, we attempted to replicate several published methods, but after numerous attempts we failed to generate satisfactory results. For instance, replicating Boavida and McCormick’s method in the lab was difficult as it has a remarkably narrow temperature optimum (22^°C) and this is a situation that clearly does not reflect the reproductive biology of A. thaliana in vivo (Boavida and McCormick, 2007). Furthermore, there are issues with germination rate and local pollen density in this method that also do not entirely reflect natural events on the stigmatic surface. Our first clue that there were key ‘missing factors’ necessary for reliable pollen germination in vitro came from observations that placing stigmatic surfaces of A. thaliana on such artificial media stimulated high levels of pollen germination in the region around the stigmatic surface. This happened even when the pollen grains were not in any direct contact with this plant tissue. Subsequently, experimental work established that two factors were particularly important (Rodriguez-Enriquez et al., 2013). Firstly, the use of cellulosic membrane on the surface of the agarose-based medium–which likely acted to mimic the ‘dry stigma’ environment that A. thaliana pollen encounters in vivo. Secondly, we discovered that the polyamide spermidine is a potent stimulant of pollen germination. We also found several other factors that contribute to the success and reproducibility of the experiments (Rodriguez-Enriquez et al., 2013). Below, we describe in detail a stepby-step method for in vitro germination of pollen from A. thaliana Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotypes, the two commonly used lab ecotypes.

However, viral proteins, particularly those encoded by compact viral genomes, are often multifunctional and therefore more challenging to study, in part because they are often difficult to tag (epitope tags, fluorescent proteins, etc.) in the context of an infectious virus genome without compromising viral infection. One workaround is to express individually tagged proteins in cells, which may result in an incomplete picture of the viral protein’s function as the other viral proteins are not present. It also does not directly determine if the functional tag interferes with the tagged protein’s function(s) in viral infection. Another approach is the empiric tagging of viral proteins in the context of an infectious virus genome, which ensures viral viability but is an inefficient process that is difficult to scale. Transposon mutagenesis can help dissect the functions of proteins under various experimental conditions and has been used at a whole genome scale to elucidate the role of various proteins during microbial infections. This approach has been successfully applied to a number of positive-strand RNA viruses (Arumugaswami et al., 2008; Beitzel et al., 2010; Teterina et al., 2011; Thorne et al., 2012; Remenyi et al., 2014; Eyre et al., 2017; Fulton et al., 2017). By coupling the transposon mutagenesis approach to Next Generation Sequence, a map of sites in the viral genome that tolerate insertions can be determined with unprecedented resolution. Once these sites are identified, functional tags can be introduced into these sites through site-directed mutagenesis. This protocol describes whole-genome transposon insertion mapping applied to the 16681 strain of serotype 2 dengue virus.

Fibronectin pools are generated transcriptionally that can be increased by several growth factors such as TGF- 1 (Yokoi et al., 2002; Mimura et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2007). The step-wise process of fibrillogenesis involving cell surface receptor Integrin q51 engagement with dimeric FN, drives the process of fibrillogenesis in cells (Yang and Hynes, 1996). Integrin α5β1 regulation by receptor activation/inactivation cycles, receptor endocytosis and recycling influences fibrillogenesis (Gao et al., 2000; White et al., 2007; Caswell et al., 2008) with FN contributing to net endocytosis rates of integrins in active conformations (Arjonen et al., 2012). The relevance of FN fibrillogenesis to cellular  outcome  has been demonstrated by  numerous  studies investigating fibril-specific  functions  for  the  FN  protein.  For  example,  a  polymeric  form  of  fibronectin  or ‘super-fibronectin’ shows anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic properties against different tumor types (Pasqualini et al., 1996; Yi and Ruoslahti, 2001).

Bio-protocol-2160	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2971	Assessment of Caenorhabditis elegans Competitive Fitness	Fitness assay, Experimental evolution, C. elegans, S. marcescens, Competition Background Accurate measurements of fitness and changes in fitness over time are critical for determining a population’s response to natural selection. Nonetheless, fitness is notoriously difficult to measure because it incorporates an individual’s survival, fecundity, reproductive timing, and must account for ecological and environmental effects on individuals. Although no protocol for measuring fitness is optimal under all possible conditions, measures of fitness that account for survival and fecundity, while holding ecological and environmental effects constant, are likely to provide reliable overall estimates of fitness for a given scenario. Here we describe a protocol for measuring the relative fitness differences between C. elegans populations or strains and for determining the change in relative fitness over evolutionary time in the presence of a bacterial parasite. We utilized the gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, as a virulent parasite when consumed by C. elegans. Especially, S. marcescens strain SM2170 is capable of killing C. elegans hosts within 24 to 48h of ingestion (Penley et al., 2017). This procedure makes use of Competitive Fitness Assays (CFAs) (Lenski et al., 1991; Wiser and Lenski, 2015), utilizing intraspecific competition to compare the relative fitness between different nematode populations or strains (Morran et al., 2009). Measurements of relative fitness, as determined via the CFA, incorporate survival and reproduction with intraspecific competition in a controlled environment to provide a comprehensive measure of fitness (Penley et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2163	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2968	Generation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell 3D Spheroids Using Low-binding Plates	Low-binding plate, Spheroid, 3D culture, Human mesenchymal stem cells, High density Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive candidate for the development of novel regenerative therapies for diseases such as stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Chen et al., 2001; Bang et al., 2005; Boido et al., 2014). Their versatility makes the optimization and standardization of techniques essential to ensure MSC therapies can provide as much benefit as possible. One possible way to maximize the therapeutic potential (e.g., enhanced secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators) of MSCs is to culture them in 3D (Bartosh et al., 2010). Cells do not normally grow in monolayers in physiological conditions, therefore culturing them in 3D provides a more realistic environment, and increases secretion of certain factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or granulocytecolony stimulating factor (GCSF), amongst others (Caplan and Correa, 2011; Redondo-Castro et al., 2018). Some of these factors exert beneficial actions leading to an enhanced repair response (TorresEspín et al., 2013; Kalladka and Muir, 2014) and by modulating the inflammatory component (Bernardo and Fibbe, 2013; Mathew et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2164	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2967	An Inexpensive and Comprehensive Method to Examine and Quantify Field Insect Community Influenced by Host Plant Olfactory Cues	Herbivores, Plant volatiles, Traps, Insect community, Olfaction Background To defend against the wide range of herbivorous insects that feed on them, plants have evolved a wide range of defenses that include direct and indirect defenses (Howe and Jander, 2008; Kariyat et al., 2012 and 2013). Among these, plant volatiles are a major group that falls under indirect defenses. Plant volatiles are low molecular weight high vapor pressure organic secondary metabolites emitted by plants as part of their normal metabolic activities (Pare and Tumlinson, 1999). However, when herbivores feed on them, they alter their volatile emission by varying it both qualitatively (number of compounds emitted) and quantitatively (amount and ratio of each compound in the blend) (Pare and Tumlinson, 1999; Kariyat et al., 2012). This altered volatile bouquet is also known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV). HIPV are the major olfactory cues that the natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of these herbivores use as signals to find their host–the herbivores (Kariyat et al., 2012), thereby indirectly improving host plant fitness. In addition, undamaged plants also emit volatile organic compounds that are used as cues by herbivores to locate their host plant for both feeding and oviposition (Kariyat et al., 2013 and 2014). A critical component of such insect-plant interaction studies involving plant volatiles is to examine and quantify the community of insects (herbivores, predators, pollinators, and other natural enemies) that gets attracted to their hosts under field conditions (Kariyat et al., 2012). Traditionally, such studies have employed one or a combination of insect traps such as commercial sticky traps, pheromone traps, and light traps to name a few. However, most of these traps have visual aid that interferes with olfactory cues. This can affect understanding the role of olfactory cues, and in many cases, the traps only collect only a subset of the actual insect community associated with the host. This protocol provides detailed instructions to use inexpensive and easily available materials to build a combination of three traps-which when combined will carry out comprehensive trapping of the majority of insects associated with the hosts (Kariyat et al., 2012). These traps can easily be assembled and disassembled, and are also reusable. The basic methodology involves building a cage from hardwire cloth which encloses the host plant/s of interest, two pitfall traps made of plastic cups, and a pan trap made of aluminum that fits on top of the cage. Combined, these traps will collect insects flying above and at the canopy level, and insects that either crawl or are soil dwellers.

In recent years, the incidence of FHB increased with the global climate change and changes in farming practices. Additionally, F. graminearum produces several mycotoxins including trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which threatens the health of humans and animals (Tanaka et al., 1988; Windels, 2000; Su et al., 2018). Up to date, the most effective tools to control FHB are derived from the studies on pathogenic mechanisms and breeding for disease resistant plant (Steiner et al., 2009; Son et al., 2013).

Many experimental manipulations have been applied to the brain slice model, such as drug applications, intracellular recordings, and optical imaging. Compared to cultured neurons, brain slices preserve many of the essential functional properties of neuronal circuits. Calcium imaging is a widely used technique designed to indicate the intracellular calcium (Ca^2+) status of isolated cells and tissues. Studying intracellular calcium in brain tissue gives insight to a variety of physiological processes such as cell proliferation, signal transduction, synaptic plasticity, and cell death as calcium concentration plays a key role in each of these functions (Cameron et al., 2016). A calcium indicator is a fluorescent molecule that binds to  C a^2+ ions to change their fluorescence light spectrum. Two classic types of calcium indicators are widely used: chemical indicators (calcium dyes) and genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). In this study, we use the typical calcium dyes to measure the calcium signal of a single neuron in brain slices. This technique has allowed our lab to study neuronal activity as well as calcium signaling in a wide variety of cell types. We describe techniques of live brain-slice calcium imaging used in our laboratory, and detail experimental protocols and know-how acquired over the years for preparing brain slices, loading neurons with dyes through patch-clamp, confocal imaging, and image processing and analysis (Du et al., 2017). The implementation of these techniques has been a powerful tool for our studies, and has allowed us to add to the vast amount of research surrounding neuronal calcium signaling.

While our understanding of the lymphatic system has rapidly expanded in the last couple of decades, it is still lacking compared to our knowledge of arterial and venous biology. The identification of LYVE-1 receptor expression by LECs provided a useful tool to distinguish lymphatic tissue but LYVE-1 is known to be expressed in other tissues including liver and spleen sinusoidal cells and pancreatic exocrine and islet of Langerhans cells (Banerji et al., 1999). Encoded by the LYVE1 gene, the biological function of the LYVE-1 receptor has yet to be determined but it has been suggested to participate in tumor metastasis in addition to HA transport across endothelial cells (Jackson, 2003). Despite it being expressed in a variety of tissues, LYVE-1 is still a commonly used marker today to distinguish LECs from other endothelial cells. The goal of this procedure was to isolate LECs from developing mouse embryos with a positive selection approach using dynabeads conjugated to LYVE-1 antibody.

Whereas bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis harbor a single circular chromosome, several species of freshwater cyanobacteria have multiple circular chromosomes per cell (Mann and Carr, 1974; Labarre et al., 1989; Binder and Chisholm, 1995). The freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter referred to as S. elongatus 7942) carries 3-8 chromosomal copies per cell (Griese et al., 2011; Watanabe et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2015). A fluorescence reporter-operator system has been established to acquire images of the multicopy chromosome of S. elongatus 7942 (Chen et al., 2012; Jain et al., 2012). Although this system enables live-cell imaging, it requires complex genetic constructs for labeling individual chromosomes, and, overall, this type of system is unstable over an extended period of cultivation. Thus, it is necessary to examine the chromosomal distribution in S. elongatus 7942 cells that have a simple genetic background. We recently established a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for visualizing the oriC region and putative terC region of the multicopy chromosome in S. elongatus 7942 (Watanabe et al., 2018). A DNA probe, which covers the oriC or terC region, was synthesized and used for the FISH analysis. Labeled chromosomes in S. elongatus 7942 cells can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol for the FISH method.

(2016). Because cyclohexane is commonly used as the solvent to wash off pollen coat layers but keeps pollen viable (Doughty et al., 1993), we developed this method to wash off secreted metabolites from the leaf surface to quantify extracellular capsidiol. The function of plasmamembrane localized transporters can be analyzed using this method, while also allowing it to be used in conjunction with other methods, such as biochemical transport analysis using plasma membrane vesicles (e.g., Sugiyama et al., 2007), in order to determine the substrate of the examined transporter.
Bio-protocol-2178	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2953	Structural Analysis of Bordetella pertussis Biofilms by	Biofilm, Confocal microscopy, Bordetella pertussis, Whooping cough, Biofilm-structure Background Bordetella pertussis is an obligate human pathogen of the upper respiratory tract that causes whooping cough or pertussis (Mooi, 2010; Dorji et al., 2018). Biofilms of B. pertussis form on a variety of artificial surfaces and under static, shaking, and fluid flow conditions (Mishra et al., 2005; Sloan et al., 2007; Serra et al., 2011). Microscopic evaluation of these biofilms shows that this bacterium produces irregularly shaped microcolonies separated by fluid channels, embedded in an exopolymeric matrix composed by extracellular DNA (eDNA), proteins and polysaccharides (Parise et al., 2007; Sloan et al., 2007; Serra et al., 2008; Conover et al., 2011; Nicholson et al., 2012; Ganguly et al., 2014; Cattelan et al., 2017). In addition to forming biofilms in the laboratory setting, B. pertussis forms multidimensional organ-adherent biofilms on the nose and trachea during experimental infections of mice. Development of these mammalian biofilms is characterized by an extracellular polymeric matrix composed of eDNA, the Filamentous hemagglutinin protein and the Bps polysaccharide (Conover et al., 2010 and 2011; Serra et al., 2011; Dorji et al., 2018). Based on these results, biofilm formation has been proposed by us and others as a possible strategy adopted by B. pertussis to infect, persist and continually circulate in the community (Cattelan et al., 2016). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that currently circulating strains from Argentina and USA produce significantly higher levels of biofilms when compared to a laboratory reference strain and colonize the mouse nose and trachea at higher numbers than the prototype laboratory strain (Cattelan et al., 2017). These results also provide evidence that hyperbiofilm growth is a strategy employed by circulating organisms to infect and survive inside their host.
Bio-protocol-2179	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2952	Protocol for the Isolation and Super-resolution dSTORM Imaging of RyR2 in Cardiac Myocytes	Super-resolution, dSTORM, Langendorff, Cell Isolation, Image processing Background In recent years, super-resolution microscopy has seen a rapid rise in popularity. A variety of super-resolution techniques have been described which enable optical resolution well below the diffraction limit of light, in some cases approaching that obtainable by electron microscopy. Together, the advent of these techniques has led to an explosion of new research into nanoscale biological structure, domains, and protein interactions. One popular super-resolution technique is direct Stochastic Optical Microscopy (dSTORM), which pairs the benefits of relatively simple sample handling with an 10× improvement in resolution in comparison with standard confocal microscopy (van de Linde et al., 2011). The trade-off, however, is an increased acquisition time as well as complexity of analysis which can seem daunting to those starting in the field. While recent commercial systems from the major imaging companies such as Zeiss, Nikon, and Olympus have made dSTORM more accessible to biologists, the technique still requires careful planning of experiments and accurate, reproducible protocols to ensure the production of high-quality images.
Bio-protocol-2180	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2951	Hypoxia Reporter Element Assay	Luciferase, Reporter assay, Hypoxia, Regulation, Transcription Background In our recent publication (van Oosterwijk et al., 2018), we sought to examine the regulation of BMX, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, in response to sorafenib treatment. BMX, a Tec kinase family member, is known bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and mediate membrane targeting by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3; Chen et al., 2013). We showed that direct treatment of sorafenib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells lines with or without stromal cell support did not contribute to the upregulation of BMX. Previous studies have shown that BMX expression can be induced by ischemia and that sorafenib has antiangiogenic activity (He et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2011). Therefore, we hypothesized that the antiangiogenic activity of sorafenib causes a hypoxic environment within the bone marrow, thus contributing to a hypoxia-dependent BMX upregulation in AML. Under hypoxic conditions, we were able to show a significant increase in BMX expression in a number of different cell lines. Further analysis of the BMX promoter identified a putative hypoxiaresponsive element (HRE; 5’-ACGTG-3’) at -5005. To test whether this HRE was involved in the hypoxiainduced promoter activation of BMX, we developed a hypoxia element reporter assay.

For HCV transmission, both cell-free transmission and cell-to-cell transmission can mediate virus transfer between hepatocytes. While cell-free transmission initiates HCV infection, cell-cell transmission is thought to transfer HCV to adjacent hepatocytes directly. It provides an excellent way to resist the neutralizing antibodies and contribute to the viral persistence (Brimacombe et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2014). Previous articles also proved some host factors which contributed to cell-cell transmission, such as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), CD81, tight junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1), Occludin (OCLN), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Witteveldt et al., 2009; Catanese et al., 2013; Zona et al., 2013). But the exact mechanisms  of  this  process  still  need  to  explore.  We  optimized  a  viral  infection-activated split-intein-mediated reporter system (VISI) for live-cell visualization of HCV infection (Zhao et al., 2017). Based on the study in Huh7.5.1 cell line using a technique of split GFP/RFP reconstitution by intein protein splicing (Figure 1A), it showed that VISI system is a very sensitive and low background system. With this system, we can clearly visualize the HCV infected cell by its nuclear fluorescence signal. In addition, combining VISI-GFP and VISI-mCherry cells, we can further monitor HCV cell-to-cell transmission in the presence of potent neutralizing antibody AR3A.

Mark Marcello#, Lilla E. Szabó#, Péter Sótonyi and Bence Rácz*	Brain, Synapse, Neuropil, Quantitative electron microscopy, Random sampling Background We performed electron microscopy using random sampling from single sections to optimize sample size (over 100 images per sample) and to detect changes in synaptic features in control and treated animals. The errors introduced by this approach are relatively modest (e.g., we found a numerical density of perforated spines in control animals similar to that of earlier studies also using single-section analysis (Calverley and Jones, 1987 and 1990). Our aim is not to make stereologicallyrigorous estimates of the absolute values; instead, we want to determine whether there are significant differences between normal and treated animals. Since we use the same sampling method for all experimental groups, we should be able to detect any substantial changes induced by an appropriate treatment protocol. However, such random sampling has a potential to underestimate differences; other methods should also be used to confirm the impact of a given treatment on the hippocampus.

Bio-protocol-2188	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2943	High-throughput YO-PRO-1 Uptake Assay for P2X7 Receptors Expressed in HEK Cells	P2X7, HEK293 cells, Microplate reader, Drug screening Background The P2X7 receptor opens a membrane channel permeable to cations (Surprenant et al., 1996; Sluyter, 2017). While electrophysiology remains the gold standard for quantifying P2X7 receptor activity, this specialized technique may not be readily available. In addition, electrophysiology is not suited for high-throughput screening, as it requires a substantial amount of time and manipulation for each recording. Uptake of a fluorescent molecule, therefore, has been a widely used alternative, especially for screening multiple conditions/mutants (Cankurtaran-Sayar et al., 2009; Qu et al., 2011). One of the most commonly used fluorescent molecules is a monomeric cyanine nucleic acid stain, YOPRO-1. This fluorescent molecule increases its green fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids in the cell. Because YO-PRO-1 directly permeates the P2X7 membrane pore, activity of this receptor can be studied by following the changes in green fluorescence (Karasawa et al., 2017). Typically, YO-PRO-1 uptake is studied using a fluorescent microscope, which allows time-dependent quantification of regionsof-interest (Surprenant et al., 1996; Rassendren et al., 1997). A major challenge, however, is to retain information about the activation kinetics while maintaining a higher throughput. To overcome this issue, we have developed a YO-PRO-1 uptake method using a fluorescent plate reader. By quickly measuring the total fluorescence from each well, our method enables data collection every 70-80 sec/well. While this  is  not near  the sampling  frequency  of  a  low-throughput  single  cell  measurement  (e.g., electrophysiology or fluorescent microscopy), it is sufficient for quantifying the initial rate of YO-PRO-1 uptake. Our newly developed method described in this protocol, therefore, is an efficient approach for screening hundreds of conditions based on P2X7 activation kinetics.

This process can be recapitulated in vitro in a plate-reader-based setup by aggregation assays based on Thioflavin T fluorescence, allowing the aggregation kinetics of amyloid proteins to be studied in dependence of various influencing factors.

Such methods help to delimitate the number of genotypes to be tested later in the field, an issue that in case of forest tree species requires considerable amounts of space. One possibility is to test young plantlets in vitro, a procedure that has the additional advantage of facilitating homogeneous and well-controlled experimental conditions. Aspects of tolerance against biotic and abiotic stress factors can be for instance screened in vitro. Among them, drought stress is receiving special attention in improvement programs. A common way to mimic water deficit is to add an osmoticum to the root supporting medium which reduces water availability. The osmoticum can be ionic like NaCl or non-ionic like mannitol, sorbitol or PEG (polyethylene glycol) (Singh and Singh, 2015). We have developed a protocol that allows testing the effect of sorbitol in vitro on hybrid larch emblings derived from somatic embryogenesis.

It is known that, as the aging progresses, the N A D^+ levels decrease in an expected process. Recent studies have shown that a reduction in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (N A D^+) is implicated in the development of age-associated metabolic decline (Massudi et al., 2012). Increased N A D^+ levels in vivo, results in activation of pro-longevity and health span-related factors and improves several physiological and metabolic parameters of aging (Camacho-Pereira et al., 2016), including muscle function, exercise capacity, glucose tolerance, and cardiac function in mouse models of natural and accelerated aging.

The need for a safe and rapid system to evaluate antibodies targeting the NA via the ELLA assay, avoiding the employment of reassortant mismatched virus or wild-type virus, has been met by producing influenza NA bearing pseudotypes (Prevato et al., 2015). A recent study (Biuso et al., 2017) confirmed that the co-expression of HA with NA improves the release of newly formed pseudotyped lentiviruses. Here we report a simple, widely applicable and optimized protocol for PV production by using the Endofectin LentiTM transfection reagent in 6-well plate format, and the methodology to perform an ELLA assay with the resulting influenza pseudotypes. While PV production for HA-based assays has made use of the lentiviral genome containing a reporter gene, the ELLA assay utilizes solely the surface NA glycoprotein, rendering a PV-incorporated reporter irrelevant to this protocol. The original ELLA assay from 1990 was recently improved (Couzens et al., 2014). This assay enables the detection of exposed galactose residues resulting from the enzymatic action of NA on sialic acids present on the fetuin substrate. This assay allows the measurement of NA inhibiting antibodies, through detection of a drop in enzymatic NA activity. The ELLA overcomes the limits of the cumbersome thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA) that employs hazardous materials, allowing for large-scale screening of serum samples. The basis of the assay is simple, 96-well plates are coated in the carbohydrate fetuin, which is then exposed to NA through NA bearing PV. The NA enzyme cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from the fetuin, exposing galactose that is then bound by the peanut agglutinin from Arachis hypogeal, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PNA-HRPO). This reagent then forms the basis for colorimetric reading of NA activity by a spectrophotometer. This activity can then be knocked down using an inhibitor (such as antibodies found in human sera) in subsequent assays. The described protocol combines the ability to screen a large number of sera through the ELLA assay, with a simple and safe lentiviral pseudotype production protocol. NA targeting antibodies are typically neglected in current influenza vaccines (compared to HA targeting antibodies), despite being shown to limit influenza symptoms and transmission (Marcelin et al., 2011 and 2012; Wohlbold and Krammer, 2014).

Changes in its composition can ultimately lead to organ malfunction or failure. Using the muscles of third instar wandering larvae as a model, we can assess the influence of the concentration of single ECM proteins on meshwork flexibility or strength with larval locomotion behavior as a readout. In general, this is also possible for first or second instar larvae, but we decided to use wandering third instar larvae due to their large body size. For precise aging of Drosophila larvae, we refer to the descriptions given by Demerec (1950).

Until now, only a few behavioral paradigms have been developed to test spatial working memory (Wenk, 2001). One of the most commonly used paradigms is the T-maze, which consists of a start arm and two arms arranged in a T-shape. In this paradigm, rats intrinsically tend to switch arm visits during consecutive trials, which suggests the rats remember the first arm that was visited, which is called “spontaneous alternation” (Lalonde, 2002). This tendency can be reinforced by baiting the arms with food when animals are mildly food deprived. Usually, protocols aim to train animals to reach a certain criterion of correct choices before pharmacological treatment starts or to accumulate the results over (Crawley and Goodwin, 1980; Deacon and Rawlins, 2006). We are interested in the role of the dopaminergic system in spatial learning and memory. For this reason, we treat animals with dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors, which block the reuptake of dopamine into the synapse and results in an increased concentration of extracellular dopamine. Further, the role of different dopamine receptors, like D1- and D2-like receptors, was elucidated through experiments that used receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. In this protocol, we use the T-maze for studying working memory, because this task is particularly sensitive to changes in the dopaminergic system compared with other working memory tests like water maze-based tasks (Bezu et al., 2017). Our overall goal is to synthesize of new compounds with high specificity to the target molecules and low side effects (Aher et al., 2016; Saroja et al., 2016; Sase et al., 2016; Hussein et al., 2017; Kristofova et al., 2018). Thus, we analyze a variety of brain structures involved in working memory processing, like the hippocampus, septum, basal forebrain, and prefrontal cortex (Chudasama and Robbins, 2004; Gruber et al., 2006) for regulation and modification of molecular signaling molecules and receptor complexes involved in memory processes (Baddeley, 1992). Rats were trained over a three day period, and we did not notice differences between pharmacologically treated rats and control rats that received additional training (up to six days) (Bezu et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2202	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2929	Embryonic Intravitreous Injection in Mouse	Embryo, Intravitreous injection, Retinal projection, Retinal axons, Uterus Background Retinal axons begin to project to LGN and SC as early as embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) in mice. To investigate axon projections in embryos, dyes need to be injected intravitreally while keeping the embryos alive for at least 10h prior to injection surgery. Previous studies showed embryos can be cultured in vitro using mouse serum with oxygen. However, issues such as nutrition diversity, oxygen saturation and temperature regulation impinge the physiological condition of the embryo. In our research, we conducted intravitreous injection through uterine wall and eyelids in embryos and kept them in uterus after injection. Retinal axon projections to LGN and SC were nicely labeled from E15.5 to E18.5.
Bio-protocol-2203	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2928	Single and Multiplexed Gene Editing in Ustilago maydis Using CRISPR-Cas9	CRISPR-Cas9, Multiplexing, Gene editing, Ustilago maydis, Smut fungi Background The basidiomycete fungus U. maydis is a model organism that has enabled important discoveries in topics like DNA repair and homologous recombination, mating, sexual development, secondary metabolism, filamentous growth, RNA transport and virulence (Holliday, 2004; Steinberg, 2007; Bakkeren et al., 2008; Holloman et al., 2008; Lanver et al., 2017; Niessing et al., 2018). U. maydis is a biotrophic plant pathogen that causes smut disease on maize. As a typical member of the large group of smut fungi its sexual development is intimately coupled with its ability to colonize plants. The popularity of U. maydis as a model organism resides in its short pathogenic life cycle that is completed in less than two weeks, its accessibility for forward and reverse genetics that includes the establishment of self-replicating plasmids (Tsukuda et al., 1988), the development of solopathogenic strains able to cause disease without mating and an available well-annotated genome (Kämper et al., 2006). In U. maydis, homologous recombination-based genome manipulations are very efficient, but become tedious when several genes have to be modified because the number of selectable markers is limited (Schuster et al., 2016). The most recent addition to the technical toolboxes for this organism has been the adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology (Schuster et al., 2016) and its development for multiplexed editing (Schuster et al., 2018). The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, developed from research in bacterial immune systems (Barrangou et al., 2007), has revolutionized molecular biology. The system allows efficient modification of almost any given sequence (Jinek et al., 2012) and has been established for a large number of organisms including filamentous fungi (Deng et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017).

It is known for its high adaptability and rapid growth rate (Chaires et al., 2017). Paulownia woods are gaining demands from all over the world due to their high stability, low thermal conductivity, decay and rot resistance etc. (Ayrilmis and Kaymakci, 2013). Apart from this, P. elongata is also known to show tolerance to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses (Chaires et al., 2017). However not many studies are done on understanding its stress tolerance mechanism, which requires extraction of high-quality RNA.

Histone modifications alter chromatin structure and/or regulate the binding of proteins, such as nucleosome  remodeling  factors  (reviewed  in  Bannister  and  Kouzarides,  2011).  Most  histone modifications are reversible and can be removed enzymatically. For example, histone acetylation is removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), of which there exist several classes. In recent years new histone lysine acylations, including succinylation, propionylation, butyrylation, hydroxybutyrylation and crotonylation have emerged as new alternative acylations to the canonical histone acetylation and the functional relevance of many of these newly discovered histone modifications have been demonstrated (reviewed in Sabari et al., 2017). In particular, histone crotonylation is associated with active gene expression and is thought to be influenced by the metabolic state of the cell (Sabari et al., 2015; Fellows et al., 2018). Class I histone deacetylases have recently been shown to also efficiently decrotonylate histones (Wei et al., 2017; Fellows et al., 2018).
Bio-protocol-2208	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2923	Micropropagation of Prickly Pear by Axillary Shoot Proliferation	Prickly pear, In vitro culture, Axillary bud proliferation, Ex vitro adaptation Background The genus Opuntia (prickly pear) is one of the members of the Cactaceae family (BravoHollis, 1978). Although it is native to the Americas, it currently grows in the wild and commercial plantations of the South of Europe, North of Africa, Australia, Middle East, West Asia and other regions of the world (Ochoa and Barbera, 1995; Kiesling and Metzing, 2017). Prickly pear has profound effects on the arid and semi-arid environments as well as the human communities that live in those areas because of its high biomass yields despite growing in drylands (Acevedo et al., 1983). In many of such areas, the genus Opuntia is exploited for a number of things. The young cladodes of Opuntia can be consumed as a vegetable; the fruit is eaten directly or processed into jelly, juice or sweets (Barba et al., 2017). The whole plant can be used for animal forage, living fence (Las Casas et al., 2017) and recently it started to be used commercially to produce biofuel (Aké Madera, 2014). In addition, the Opuntia genus has a number of bioactive and nutritionally valuable compounds (Betancourt et al., 2017; Melgar et al., 2017).

In subsequent years and decades, biochemists started to delve into purifying extracts from rat tail collagen and started their use as a highly polymerizable 3D matrix (Fitch et al., 1955; Gross et al., 1955; Chandrakasan et al., 1976). It wasn’t until the 1990’s that 3D matrices truly became useful to the cell biology community, especially for studying cell migration (Friedl et al., 1995). Recently, a transition from simplified two-dimensional (2D) studies on ECMs to 3D has begun. This evolution has followed shortly behind the recent advances in fluorescence microscopy, especially super-resolution microscopy. While standard laser scanning confocal microscopes can utilize reflection microscopy or two-photon-based second harmonic generation to visualize collagen fibers in the absence of a fluorescent tag, both techniques do not always properly depict the ECM architecture due either to polarity issues or lack of a significant fibril thickness. A fluorescently-tagged ECM allows imaging of the smallest individual fibrils even with super-resolution techniques.

Ferns are characteristic by their unique life cycle. Compared with seed plants, the sporophyte of ferns bear spores for spreading instead of seeds. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate to form gametophytes, in which cells on certain areas (rib) specialize into reproductive organs to produce gametes. After water-dependent fertilization, the newborn sporophyte emerge and an entire life cycle of fern completes (Li et al., 2013). Hence, to study the sexual reproduction processes and life history of ferns, spore cultivation under experimental conditions is necessary.
Bio-protocol-2218	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2913	FRAP: A Powerful Method to Evaluate Membrane Fluidity in Caenorhabditis elegans	FRAP, Membrane fluidity, Prenylated GFP, C. elegans, Fatty acid, PAQR-2 Background Biological membranes, defining features of all cells, are primarily composed of phospholipids (Van Meer et al., 2008). The fatty acid species present in the phospholipid bilayer greatly influence its properties. For example, a high saturated fatty acid content increases membrane rigidity while a high unsaturated fatty acid content promotes fluidity (Pilon, 2016). The fatty acid composition of cellular membranes often shows clear correlations with the composition of dietary fats, which can be incorporated directly into phospholipids (Abbott et al., 2012; Dancy et al., 2015). However, considering that wide variations in diets exist, cells must have regulatory mechanisms that monitor and adjust membrane composition and achieve the desired membrane properties, such as fluidity, curvature, thickness, etc. Using FRAP on worms that express a prenylated GFP in intestinal cells, we have previously shown that mutants lacking PAQR-2, a homolog of the mammalian adiponectin receptors, have reduced membrane fluidity upon cultivation in the presence of glucose or on diets rich in saturated fatty acids (Svensk et al., 2016; Devkota et al., 2017). During FRAP, fluorescent molecules in a specified region are photobleached using a high-power laser and subsequent recovery of the bleached region is recorded and quantified (Reits and Neefjes, 2001). Here we describe a detailed FRAP protocol to study the fluidity of membranes in C. elegans.

These organelles are essential for plant growth and development, with varied functions throughout the plant's life. Vacuoles compartmentalize different components, such as proteins, sugars, ions and specialized metabolites, and are involved in the plant's response to different developmental and environmental signals, e.g., stomatal opening, adaptation to cold, defense against herbivores and floral pigmentation (Shitan and Yazaki, 2013). Specific transporters are employed by vacuoles to allow penetration of inorganic ions and hydrophilic metabolites through the lipid bilayer membrane of the tonoplast (Schneider et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015).

(Han et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). However, the protocol still shows instability and high degradation rate in our experiment.

In addition, APP can also form dimers through the membrane-bound C99 (Cterminal 99 amino acid fragment) region. Importantly, C99 dimerization has been linked to A production in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.

These signaling structures were first classified and described in detail in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disc, and have subsequently been observed in mouse, chick and zebrafish model organisms (Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999; Sanders et al., 2013; Stanganello et al., 2015). In most of these cases, cytoneme detection was only possible with live imaging of over-expressed, fluorescently labeled proteins. Examination of cytonemes of cultured cells has been limited due to traditional fixation protocols failing to preserve these fragile filaments. These complications have been limiting factors in determining the cellular  mechanisms  driving  cytoneme formation  and function  during  development  and tissue homeostasis, and determining whether these processes are corrupted in disease.

Bio-protocol-2235	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2896	Increasing the Membrane Permeability of a Fern with DMSO	Filmy ferns, Membrane permeability, DMSO, Propidium iodide Background One of the most remarkable characteristics of filmy ferns is that the frond, apart from the vascular tissue, is made of a single cell layer and lacks stomata. In our previous work (Garcés et al. 2018), we incubated Hymenophyllum caudiculatum fronds with cycloheximide or actinomycin D to study the effects of translation, or transcription inhibition respectively. If an exogen inhibitor incubated with a filmy fern frond does not affect plant physiology, it may be because the inhibitor fails to enter the cell. In order to improve the entrance of inhibitors into the cell, we tested if an aqueous solution of 0.1% DMSO has effects on cell membrane permeability, visualizing the entrance of propidium iodide (PI) into the cells.
Bio-protocol-2236	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2895	ChIP-seq Experiment and Data Analysis in the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Joaquín Giner-Lamia1, 2, *, Miguel A. Hernández-Prieto1, 3 and Matthias E. Futschik1, 4, 5	ChIP-seq, Cyanobacteria, Synechocystis, Nitrogen, NtcA Background To maintain homeostasis, bacteria frequently need to adjust gene expression in response to environmental changes. Many of these adjustments are controlled by transcriptional factors (TF) that sense metabolic signals and activate or repress target genes. However, reflecting the traditionally laborious tasks necessary to characterize the activity and scope of TFs in vivo, our knowledge of their binding sites in bacteria is still limited. Only recently, the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation  with  high-throughput  sequencing  analysis  has  opened  the  door  to  rapid determination of genome-level regulons. In particular, ChIP-seq uses the capacity of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify numerous DNA sequences in parallel. An attractive feature of ChIP-seq, compared to microarrays, is that there is no restriction to certain regions, such as promoter sequences, and the whole genome can be investigated for TF binding sites.

This is also particularly important for the biotechnological application of biofilms in biocatalysis, biosensing and waste treatment (Zhou et al., 2013; Jensen et al., 2016). The biofilm formation always begins with the bacterial adhesion to a substrate, which determines the spatial organization in biofilms (Liu et al., 2016; Nadell et al., 2016). Many strategies have been proposed to control bacterial adhesion such as modifying bacterial surface with bio-orthogonal reactive groups via liposome fusion (Elahipanah et al., 2016), immobilization of adhesive molecules on the substrates (Sankaran et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Peschke et al., 2017) and conjugating surface tags on bacteria (Poortinga et al., 2000; Rozhok et al., 2005; Lui et al., 2013). Among these, the light responsive approaches provide the highest spatiotemporal control, which is important to precisely control the fine structure of the biofilms. For instance, azobenzene linkers have been used as a photoswitchable tool to reversibly control the bacterial adhesion to substrates by altering the presentation of mannose, which is recognized by the bacterial surface receptor FimH (Voskuhl et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2014; Sankaran et al., 2015). In addition, azobenzene-based molecules have also been used to control bacteria adhesion to mammalian cells (Mockl et al., 2016), bacterial quorum sensing (Van der Berg et al., 2015) and biofilm formation (Hu et al., 2016) with UV-light. One of the major drawbacks of using UV-light is that it is toxic to bacteria. In this protocol, we present a new approach of how to control bacterial adhesion to substrates with blue light based on photoswitchable proteins. Besides being a non-invasive, reversible and tuneable technique to control bacterial adhesion to substrates, it also provides high spatiotemporal control required to form
Bio-protocol-2239	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2892	Visualization of RNA at the Single Cell Level by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization Coupled to Flow Cytometry	RNA, Flow cytometry, In situ, Hybridization, Single cell, Human Background RT-qPCR is one major technique used to easily assess RNA expression. Cells are lysed and analyzed in bulk. Hence, cell heterogeneity is lost. In particular, it is impossible using RT-qPCR to address whether subpopulations may be identified based on the expression of RNA. RNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a way to detect RNA in single cells. This technique requires hybridization of fluorescent probes on RNA targets that are then detected using an imaging system such as a confocal microscope. However, this method is time-consuming and allows the analysis of a limited number of individual cells.
Bio-protocol-2240	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2891	Characterizing the Transcriptional Effects of Endolysin Treatment on Established Biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus	Biofilms, Endolysins, Staphylococcus aureus, RNA-seq, Responses to antimicrobials Background It is becoming increasingly clear that subinhibitory doses of antimicrobials may have a regulatory effect on different phenotypes of the target microbes, including biofilm formation, metabolism or virulence. Therefore, studying the potential impact of a novel compound on the target cells at low-level concentrations should be a part of the development process. Indeed, a very effective antibacterial agent that triggers production of virulence factors or antibiotic resistance determinants may not be a good candidate for therapeutic application. On the other hand, considering the physiological differences between biofilm and planktonic cells, it seems logical that the effect of new antibiofilm agents should be analyzed on biofilm-forming cells. Here, we describe a protocol for the analysis of transcriptional responses of biofilm cells upon exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of endolysins, phage-derived proteins that show great promise as biofilm removal agents. Thus, the transcriptome of endolysin-treated cells was compared to control cells by RNA-seq and differential expression of selected genes was later confirmed by RT-qPCR.

Bio-protocol-2245	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2886	Isolation of Microvascular Endothelial Cells	Primary culture, Endothelial cells, Tight junctions, CD31, Pecam1 Background Microvascular endothelial cells play a central role in the development of immune responses by regulating leukocyte recirculation and as antigen presenting cells to T lymphocytes. The wellbeing of the endothelium is essential to vascular homeostasis. The dysfunctional endothelium participates  in  various  cardiovascular  disorders,  including  atherosclerosis,  vasculitis  and ischemia/reperfusion injuries (Cid et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007). Therefore, in vitro endothelial cell cultures are important tools for studying vascular physiology and disease pathology. However, the isolation of primary murine endothelial cells is considered particularly difficult because most protocols described have involved the perfusion of organs or large vessels with digesting enzymes and time-consuming purification process (Gumkowski et al., 1987).

Distinct microbiota acquired by each root niche likely have varying metabolic potential and may therefore impact the health of the host plant in different ways (Finkel et al., 2017). Bacterial and archaeal community composition in root-associated microbiota can be inferred through the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Caporaso et al., 2012). The relatively low cost of sequencing now allows for comparative studies across plant species using datasets gathered by different research groups; however, small aberrations in specimen collection, sequencing, and analysis protocols may lead to large differences in the inferred microbial communities (Duvallet et al., 2017). We present this protocol detailing how to collect and analyze root microbiota from rice in an attempt to promote reproducibility across the plant microbiome field.

Bio-protocol-2251	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2880	Analysis of Autophagic Activity Using ATG8 Lipidation Assay in Arabidopsis thaliana	ATG8, ATG8-PE, Lipidation, Autophagy, Autophagosome Background Autophagy is an essential metabolic process which mediates the bulk degradation of the damaged organelles and unwanted cellular contents. During autophagy, a double-membrane structure called autophagosome will form and deliver the cargos into the vacuole for degradation. The autophagyrelated (ATG) proteins are required to regulate the autophagic activity (Liu and Bassham, 2012). Among them, two conjugation systems, including ATG8 conjugate and ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, are involved for autophagosome formation. Upon autophagic induction, the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate forms and functions as an E3-like enzyme to promote ATG8 lipidation for binding to the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the autophagosome membrane (Ohsumi, 2001). Although ATG8-PE on the outer membrane will be recycled before the autophagosome fusion with the vacuole, ATG8-PE on inner membrane will traffic together with the cargo into the vacuole for degradation. Thus, the amount of ATG8-PE usually correlates with the number of punctate ATG8-positive structures as well as autophagic activity (Mizushima et al., 2010). Particularly, due to the high hydrophobicity of ATG8-PE, ATG8-PE migrates faster than ATG8 in SDS-PAGE gel, though the actual molecular weight of ATG8-PE is larger than the unconjugated ATG8 (Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007). Accordingly, the amount of ATG8-PE from cell membrane fraction (CM) can be detected by immunoblotting with ATG8 antibodies. For example, in Arabidopsis atg5 mutant, the level of ATG8-PE is severely impaired upon autophagic induction, whereas no autophagosome structures labeled by ATG8 are formed (Chung et al., 2010). Therefore, biochemical detection of the ATG8 lipidation can serve as a useful method to access the autophagic activity when combined with different treatments, which has been applied in our previous study as well as others related to plant autophagy (Chung et al., 2010; Suttangkakul et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2017). Here, we describe the protocol for ATG8 lipidation detection by ultracentrifuge separation of the membrane and cytosol fractions using acibenzolar-S-methyl (BTH)-treated seedlings (Zhuang et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2252	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2879	Enhancement of Mucus Production in Eukaryotic Cells and Quantification of Adherent Mucus by ELISA	Mucus, Mucin, ELISA, Cell culture, HT29 Background The interface of the body with the external environment is formed by mucosal surfaces. These mucosal epithelial tissues can be found for example in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, reproductive, and urinary tracts, and the surface of the eye. Due to their exposure to the external environment many microorganisms populate these tissues. Therefore, these epithelia have evolved multiple mechanisms of defense in response to their vulnerability to microbial attack. Many defensive compounds are secreted into the mucosal fluid, including mucins, antibodies, defensins, protegrins, collectins, cathelicidins, lysozyme, histatins, and nitric oxide (Kagnoff and Eckmann, 1997; Lu et al., 2002; Raj and Dentino, 2002).
Bio-protocol-2253	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2878	In vitro Chaperone Activity Assay Using α-Amylase as Target Protein	Small heat shock proteins, sHSP18, α-amylase, Chaperone assay, Heat inactivation Background Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a conserved group of proteins which are induced when cells are exposed to external stress including heat and cold stress. Most of the members in this group are functionally related and are involved in the protein folding and unfolding mechanism. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a subset of HSPs with a molecular size ranging from 12 to 43k D a and a conserved C-terminal region, called dotmu_a -crystalline domain’. The sHSPs show ATP independent molecular chaperone activity by binding to partially unfolded proteins and preventing their complete denaturation. There are several methods for demonstrating in vitro chaperone activity of sHSPs, using various substrate proteins like RuBisCO (Goloubinoff et al., 1989), rhodanese (Mendoza et al., 1992), insulin (Farahbakhsh et al., 1995), lysozyme (Rozema and Gellman, 1996), malate dehydrogenase (Lee et al., 1997), citrate synthase (Grallert et al., 1998), xylose reductase (Rawat and Rao, 1998), sorbitol dehydrogenase (Marini et al., 2000) and luciferase (Bepperling et al., 2012) etc. In these assays, the protective activity of sHSPs or other molecular chaperones is demonstrated based on their efficiency in refolding and prevention of aggregation during heat or chemical denaturation. These substrates have different quaternary structures, different rates of folding, and different tendencies to undergo irreversible side reactions during denaturation and HSP assisted renaturation. It has also been shown that protection against heat-inactivated restriction enzymes like NdeI and SmaI can be used to demonstrate the chaperone activity of α-crystallin in vitro (Hess and FitzGerald, 1998; Santhoshkumar and Sharma, 2001). HSP18 is one of the major immunodominant antigens of Mycobacterium leprae, and has been functionally characterized as an sHSP (Lini et al., 2008). In this protocol, we describe a simple method to assay chaperone activity of small heat shock proteins using heat inactivated α-amylase. The efficiency of sHSPs in preventing heat denaturation of α-amylase is demonstrated on starch agar plates after staining with an vert_2 -KI solution. The iodine reagent binds to the starch polymer to form a dark blue color in the starch agar plates. Clear halos surrounding each well with sample are indicative of active amylase enzyme, which digests the starch in the agar plate (Atlas et al., 1995). The advantage of this method is its simplicity and the empirical demonstration of results on starch agar plates.

Bio-protocol-2256	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2875	In vitro Osteoclastogenesis Assays Using Primary Mouse Bone Marrow Cells	Osteoclastogenesis, Osteoclast, Primary bone marrow, TRAP staining, Cell culture Background The skeleton is maintained by successive and well-controlled absorbance and formation of bone mass during lifetime. In the bone cavity, each of these two activities is carried out by a specialized cell type: the bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are derived from bone-resident mesenchymal cells and hematopoietic lineage progenitor cells, respectively. The differentiation of hematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells into mature osteoclasts are majorly controlled by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL, encoded by TNFSF11) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, encoded by CSF1) derived from osteoblasts and its progenitor cells (Suda et al., 1999). Unlike other cells, osteoclasts differentiate through fusion of a certain number of progenitor cells (Boyle et al., 2003). Thus, a key histological feature of mature osteoclasts is their multiple nuclei. After maturation, osteoclasts are capable of bone resorption by producing an acidified microenvironment to dissolve bone mass mainly composed of calcium phosphate, along with proteases to degrade extracellular matrix (Boyle et al., 2003). The dissolved bone matrix releases sequestered growth factors utilized by osteoblasts to expand their population (Kassem and Bianco, 2015). This cross-talk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts ensures coordinate bone-forming and -degenerating activity, which is dysregulated in a plethora of diseases, including osteoporosis, arthritis and bone metastasis of cancers (Rodan and Martin, 2000; Raisz, 2005; Gupta and Massague, 2006). Based on previous literature (Lu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2017), here we describe a step-by-step protocol for an in vitro osteoclastogenesis assay using primary murine bone marrow cells that allows studying the effect of a broad range of factors/conditions (such as cytokines and conditioned medium) on osteoclast differentiation.
Bio-protocol-2257	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2874	3D Culture Protocol for Testing Gene Knockdown Efficiency and Cell Line Derivation	3D culture, Tumorspheres, Cancer cell line, shRNA gene silencing Background 3D in vitro cancer cell models represent a bridge experimental method between cell lines and tumors grown in vivo (Pampaloni et al., 2007; Weiswald et al., 2015). 3D characters of solid tumors with heterogeneous access to nutrients or oxygen can only be effectively mimicked by 3D culture systems. In recent years, protocols for tumorsphere culture gained lot of interest. A tumorsphere can be described as a solid, spherical object created from a single progenitor or stem cell. For tumorspheres formation assays, cells are seeded and grown in serum-free media in ultra-low attachment plates (nonadherent conditions), which allows enrichment of cancer cells with stem/progenitor properties (Johnson et al., 2013). Tumorspheres generated from freshly isolated tumor tissue are of special interest in the field because cells from established cell lines typically differ from the primary tumor due to mutations and abnormalities gained during multiple rounds of in vitro passaging. Hereby, we present an optimized protocol for 3D culture-based primary tumor cell isolation and the use of 3D culture to assess the effect of gene silencing on the growth of tumor-initiation cells.

Several hybrid CTX-Mlactamases (CTX-M-64, CTX-M-123, CTX-M-137, and CTX-M-132), presumably resulting from recombination between the blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15 genes, the most common variants worldwide, have been reported in recent years (Nagano et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2014; He et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015). Among these hybrid enzymes, CTX-M-64, which contained the N- and C-terminal portions of CTX-M15 and the middle fragment of CTX-M-14, exhibited even higher catalytic activity than their parental prototypes (He et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-2261	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2870	The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): A Spatial Navigation Task for Rats	Spatial navigation, Cognition, Planning, Working memory, Executive function, Optimization Background The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a spatial navigation task in which participants are asked to select the shortest possible route that visits each target in a spatial array. This task has been of interest to computer and cognitive scientists for some time (Best, 2006), but has more recently been studied from the perspective of comparative psychology (e.g., de Jong et al., 2011; Gibson et al., 2012; Baron et al., 2015). Humans are inexplicably good at finding solutions to this problem – despite its mathematical intractability, human participants can rapidly and easily produce solutions that are nearly optimal (MacGregor et al., 2000). One possible explanation for this high level of performance is that the task capitalizes on evolved processes used for natural behaviors like foraging (Blaser and Ginchansky, 2012; Blaser and Wilber, 2013). We were therefore interested in the mechanisms by which non-human animals complete the task (Bellizzi et al., 2015; Goldsteinholm and Blaser, 2015).

It is not transmissible through seed (Konaté et al., 2001; Allarangaye et al., 2006) but by insect vectors (particularly beetles) and by contact during agricultural operations (Bakker, 1974; Traoré et al., 2006), especially while transplanting seedlings from seedbeds to the field. The virus is highly stable and capable of multiplying at high concentrations in its rice and wild Poaceae (Bakker, 1974) hosts.
Bio-protocol-2269	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2862	In vivo Use of Dextran-based Anterograde Cortical Tracers	Cortical spinal tract, Anterograde tracer, Spinal cord, Animal model Background The motor cortex contains upper motor neurons which give rise to descending axons that form the CST and terminate in the spinal cord. Anterograde tracers injected into the motor cortex of rats label these descending fibers of the CST allowing their terminals to be assessed at the level of the spinal cord (Figure 1). In rodent models, anterograde labeling of the CST is widely used to assess CST integrity in a range of spinal cord injury models including lesions (Thallmair et al., 1998; Vavrek et al., 2006) and contusions (Hill et al., 2001). Further, anterograde cortical tracers have been used to assess spared fibers and plasticity of the CST in various models of brain injury such as cortical stroke (Wahl et al., 2014; Wiersma et al., 2017), traumatic brain injury (Ueno et al., 2012) and pyramidotomy (Starkey et al., 2012). Here we provide detail methods on injection of anterograde tracers into motor cortex corresponding the forelimb. We describe how to create burr holes without inducing damage to the cortex and the use of pulled glass pipette tips for minimally invasive injection. Since the CST is widely assessed in both brain and spinal cord injury models, we offer a systematic method of assessing the CST and branching fibers in the surrounding spinal grey matter that accounts for variability due to inter-animal differences in tracer efficacy or uptake.
Bio-protocol-2270	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2861	Induction of Photothrombotic Stroke in the Sensorimotor Cortex of Rats and	Photothrombosis, Ischemic infarct, Stroke model, Stroke volume, Ischemia Background The photothrombotic model of stroke allows for the precise placement of an ischemic infarct in specific regions of the cortex (Carmichael, 2005; Underly and Shih, 2017). Photothrombosis can be used to occlude specific arteries and arterial branches in the cortex (Carmichael et al., 2005), individual vessels of the pia (Taylor and Shih, 2013) and defined cortical areas such as the barrel field (Dietrich et al., 1987) and hind limb somatosensory cortex (Que et al., 1999). Using this approach, highly reproducible ischemic infarcts have been generated in many experimental animal models including rodents (Watson et al., 1985; Carmichael et al., 2005) and non-human primates (Ikeda et al., 2013). Photothrombosis of the forelimb sensorimotor cortex is useful as it results in localized sensorimotor impairment in forelimb use that can be carefully quantified using a variety of behavioral tests after stroke and during recovery (Sist et al., 2014; Wiersma et al., 2017). The methods presented here allows for the induction of consistent ischemic infarcts of the forelimb sensorimotor cortex that result in significant and long-lasting deficits in forelimb motor function (Wiersma et al., 2017). There is currently no standardized method of identifying both the volume of induced stroke and the anatomical location of stroke in the cortex. Here, we provide methods on systematic identification of the precise cortical location of photothrombotic infarct and analysis of stroke volume. Exclusion criteria for animal stroke models are widely varied. Therefore we provide guidelines to establish criteria for exclusion of animals that deviate from expected stroke volumes or stereotaxic locations.

Bio-protocol-2272	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2859	Rapid Screening and Evaluation of Maize Seedling Resistance to Stalk Rot Caused by Fusarium spp.	Corn stalk rot, Disease resistance, Fusarium spp., Seedling assay Background Maize is one of the most important staple food crops and energy plants worldwide. It has been becoming the No.1 crop species in China and worldwide regarding both yield and planting areas since 2012. However, corn stalk rot has become one of the most destructive diseases, which normally lead to significant yield loss and quality reduction of maize extensively (Oerke, 2006). The pathogens causing corn stalk rot mainly include the soil-borne fungal species, such as Fusarium graminearum,  F.  verticillioides,  Colletotrichum  graminicola,  Pythium  aphanidermatum,  and Pectobacterium chrysanthemi. Infection of maize by F. graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae Schw. Petch) normally causes Gibberella stalk rot with reddish-pink discoloration inside the stalk, and Gibberella ear rot with carcinogenic mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone produced in mature corn kernels that are harmful to human and animals (Mesterhazy et al., 2012). Moreover, F. graminearum is also the major causal agent infecting other small grain cereal crops, such as wheat, leading to the well-known Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is one of the most serious diseases impacting wheat production in China and is endemic in many wheat-producing countries (Walter et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2017). F. verticillioides =F. moniliforme J. Sheld.(sexual stage: G. moniliformis Wineland), on the other hand, predominantly infect maize, resulting in Fusarium stalk rot and Fusarium ear rot, and producing Fumonisins, another type of mycotoxins in maize kernels (Presello et al., 2008).
Bio-protocol-2273	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2858	Osteoblast Sorting and Intracellular Staining of CXCL12	Bone marrow niche, HSC, Osteoblast, CXCL12, Intracellular staining Background The bone marrow niche is a highly organized microenvironment with stroma cells that engage in direct cell-cell interaction with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that regulate HSC quiescence, differentiation, and mobilization (Anthony and Link, 2014; Mendelson and Frenette, 2014; Morrison and Scadden, 2014). Multiple cell types in HSC niche may contribute to niche functional support in distinct but maybe overlapping ways. These cells include but are not limited to osteoblasts, osteoclasts, CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, Nestin+ stroma cells, leptin receptor+ (L e p R^+) stroma cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, megakaryocytes, neuronal, and the non-myelinating Schwann cells. Most HSCs are found in the trabecular region of bone marrow, suggesting an important HSC supporting role of the endosteum as well as factors made by osteoblasts and other cells in the endosteum (Kiel et al., 2005; Lo Celso et al., 2009). The majority of long-term HSCs are located in close vicinity of the sinusoid in close contact with LepR+ and CXCL12high niche cells, indicating a perivascular niche composed by endothelial or perivascular cells (Kiel et al., 2005; Sugiyama et al., 2006; Acar et al., 2015). In addition to the perivascular niche associated with sinusoid, mesenchymal cells that surround arterioles in the bone marrow are also important for the maintenance of quiescent HSCs (Kunisaki et al., 2013). Osteoblasts are specialized endosteum-lining cells that are terminally differentiated products of mesenchymal stem cells. Characterization of murine primary osteoblasts has been achieved through culture of outgrowth of collagenase treated bone and retrospective functional analysis (Bakker and Klein-Nulend, 2011). However, culture-based analysis has been complicated by the heterogeneity of the tissue. Immunophenotyping of murine osteoblasts based on defined CD markers is a rapid and prospective approach of phenotypic analysis of osteoblasts in various disease processes. Isolated osteoblasts through flow-based sorting are especially suitable for downstream applications such as gene expression analysis.
Bio-protocol-2274	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2857	Ectopic Gene Expression in Macrophages Using in vitro Transcribed mRNA	mRNA transfection, Macrophage, Protein expression Background Typical methods to achieve protein expression, including transfecting DNA using cationic polymers, nucleofection, and viral transduction (Zhang et al., 2009), are particularly difficult in macrophages, as these cells have a potent immune response to various danger signals such as cytosolic DNA. Therefore, conventional methods for exogenous gene delivery result in poor transfection efficiency and cell death. We reasoned that transfecting mRNA, instead of DNA, would be a better alternative to achieve protein expression in macrophages, as suggested by recent reports (Van De Parre et al., 2004; McLenachan et al., 2013). We were able to achieve high transfection efficiencies without loss of macrophage viability (Koster et al., 2017). Our method does not require expensive equipment and can be adapted for expressing exogenous and endogenous proteins.
Bio-protocol-2275	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2856	Enzymatic Activity Assay for Invertase in Synechocystis Cells	Cyanobacteria, Synechocystis, Invertase enzymatic activity, Sucrose, Ion chromatography Background Invertase and sucrose play important physiological roles in cyanobacteria (Curatti, et al., 2008; Kolman et al., 2015) and higher plants (Vargas et al., 2003; Vargas et al., 2010). Invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) can catalyze the sucrose degradation into glucose and fructose. Due to this characteristic of the invertase, any methods which could be used for the determination of glucose or fructose would be theoretically used for the invertase enzymatic activity assay. In fact, most of the invertase enzymatic activity assays are based on the detection of the generated glucose product.

Bio-protocol-2277	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2854	Intra-amniotic Injection of Mouse Embryos	Intra-amniotic, Embryos, Virus, Infection Background It has been more than sixty years since the first human case of ZIKV infection was reported but in 2007 only 14 human cases of ZIKV infection had been recorded. Prognosis data have lagged far behind the recent outbreak of ZIKV in 2015. There is some evidence that mouse models may be effective for prognosis studies because previous reports have proved neurovirulence of ZIKV in mice. Therefore, various methods of ZIKV infection including intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection, foot-pad injection and brain injection have been used to study congenital Zika syndrome in individuals during the embryonic period or infancy. The intra-amniotic injection model presented here has two advantageous features. First, wild-type mice (C57 BL/6J) can be used and studies are not limited to mice with immunologic deficiencies. Second, ZIKV infected mice can grow into puberty, which is beneficial to studies trying to evaluate prognosis.
Bio-protocol-2278	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2853	Sociability and Social Novelty Preference Tests Using a U-shaped Two-choice Field	Social interaction, Social recognition, Social novelty, Social preference Background Sociability is the behavioral disposition of being sociable with others. Sociability is defective in psychiatric disorders including depression, autism and schizophrenia. Defective sociability is regarded to be an important behavioral symptom representing a state of psychiatric illness (Hirschfeld et al., 2000; American Psychiatric Association., 2013; Green et al., 2015; Barak and Feng, 2016). Animal models have been used to investigate the neural mechanisms of sociability, as well as the neuropathological mechanisms of psychiatric illness. A variety of sociability tests have been developed to measure specific aspects of social behaviors of experimental animals, such as social interactions (Moy et al., 2004; Berton et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2008; Silverman et al., 2010), social communication using olfactory and visual cues or vocalization (Arakawa et al., 2008; Radyushkin et al., 2009; Scattoni et al., 2009; Yang and Crawley, 2009), social novelty preference and social memory (Moy et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2017a; Lee et al., 2017).

In fact, many researchers and companies are searching for the best way to deliver cells into the human body to optimize cell survival as well as integration into the host tissue. Injection methods have been widely used in animal models but often result in poor survival and integration. Techniques utilizing biomaterials and surgical devices are currently being employed. One technique that has been utilized to deliver stem cells is fibrin carriers. Fibrin gel is a degradable biopolymer that can adhere to native tissue allowing for cell attachment, migration and proliferation (Ehrbar et al., 2005). Fibrin gels have many advantages including biocompatibility, controlled degradation (Kjaergard et al., 1994; Sidelmann et al., 2000), uniform cell distribution and high cell seeding efficiency (Swartz et al., 2005). Fibrin gels have been utilized for treating skin burns (Pellegrini et al., 1999; Ronfard et al., 2000), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (Hirsch et al., 2017) and corneal damage (Pellegrini et al., 1997; Rama et al., 2010). The method described here uses a fibrin carrier to transplant hair follicle derived stem cells onto the ocular surface of a limbal stem cell-deficient mouse. Cell engraftment and differentiation was assessed for a 5-week period via fluorescent microscopy.
Bio-protocol-2283	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2848	Hair Follicle Stem Cell Isolation and Expansion	Holoclones, Clonal expansion, Hair follicle stem cells, Bulge, Stem cell isolation Background Stem cells are widely used for a multitude of translational and clinical applications. One such clinical application is for the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). LSCD occurs when there is dysfunction or loss of the limbal stem cell population, which is critical for maintaining a healthy ocular surface, due to congenital or acquired pathologies. The primary treatment strategy for LSCD is cultivating autologous epithelial cell sheets from a limbal biopsy of the patient’s healthy eye (Pellegrini et al., 1997; Shortt et al., 2007). The limitation of this strategy is that it is only applicable for patients that have unilateral LSCD. Those that have bilateral LSCD, must rely on an allogenic limbal biopsy from an immunologically  related  living  donor  or  cadaveric  tissue.  Due  to  the  need  of  systemic immunosuppressive therapy and the limited availability of donor tissue, the therapeutic success rate is decreased. Several research groups have been examining the use of cultivated oral mucosal cells for the treatment of LSCD and have achieved some success. However, these cells often fail to express the corneal epithelial differentiation marker, Keratin 12 (Inatomi et al., 2006) and often result in the development of peripheral neovascularization (Nakamura et al., 2004; Nishida et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2009). Due to these limitations, there was a need for an alternative source of autologous stem cells. Thus we focused on the use of hair follicle stem cells as they harbor multiple sources of stem cells that have been used in regenerative medicine (Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Purba et al., 2014). The hair follicle contains mesenchymal stem cells in the dermal papilla and connective tissue sheath, which can give rise to several cell lineages (Lako et al., 2002; Jahoda et al., 2003; Richardson et al., 2005). Additionally, the bulge region of the hair follicle contains stem cells, which can generate the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle structures and sebaceous glands (Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Taylor et al., 2000; Cotsarelis, 2006). The hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) derived from the bulge region express of variety of cytokeratins including cytokeratin 15 (Krt15) (Tiede et al., 2007; Kloepper et al., 2008; Larouche et al., 2008), which has been successfully used for the purification and enrichment of HFSC (Blazejewska et al., 2009). HFSC have been successfully used in the treatment of a mouse model of LSCD (Meyer-Blazejewska et al., 2011) and research continues to focus on other therapeutic applications and the eventual translation to humans (Purba et al., 2014). Continued research efforts into these areas rely on a standard method for isolating and expanding the bugle-derived HFSC.
Bio-protocol-2284	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2847	Quantification of Hydrogen Sulfide and Cysteine Excreted by Bacterial Cells	Hydrogen sulfide, Thiols, Cysteine, Escherichia coli, Measurement, Detection Background  Reduced  sulfur  species  are  generated  by  microbes  through  several  routes. Sulfate-reducing bacteria exploit the reductive process as an integral part of energy generation. Other bacteria release sulfide as a by-product of either the deliberate or adventitious degradation of sulfur species, including cysteine. We have observed that cysteine itself is excreted when intracellular levels are abnormally high, a situation that can occur through uncontrolled amino acid import or dysregulation of cysteine synthesis. These sulfur species are unusually reactive, as they bind metals with high avidity and also are among the few biomolecules that react chemically with molecular oxygen. The upshot is that reduced sulfur compounds can exert important effects upon cells. Hence, it can be important to track the dynamics of reduced sulfur compounds in a variety of contexts.
Bio-protocol-2285	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2846	Ex vivo Follicle Rupture and in situ Zymography in Drosophila	Drosophila, Ovulation, Follicle rupture, Octopamine, in situ zymography, Follicle cells Background The study of ovulation in Drosophila has largely been limited due to technical challenges in direct visualization and quantification of ovulation events. In the last several decades, multiple indirect methods have been developed with limitations. The first method for the study of ovulation in Drosophila is to push the female’s abdomen and record if an egg was ejected from the ovipositor (Aigaki et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2003). This method is a rough estimate of whether there’s an ovulated egg inside the uterus. The second common assay is to measure the egg-laying capacity of female flies after mating. The egg-laying process is complex, involving development and maturation of a follicle, ovulation, transportation of the ovulated egg through the oviduct, selection of an appropriate egg-laying substrate, and oviposition (Spradling, 1993; Bloch Qazi et al., 2003). If any of these processes are impaired, it will result in defective egg laying. Another indicator that ovulation is impaired is an egg-retention phenotype (Monastirioti et al., 1996; Monastirioti, 2003; Cole et al., 2005). If a female has an excess of mature follicles within her ovaries, it indicates an anovulatory phenotype. However, this can be caused directly by an ovulation defect or indirectly by a defect downstream of ovulation in the egg-laying process. On the other hand, a lack of egg-retention phenotype does not necessarily mean a lack of ovulation defect. A fourth type of assay used to study ovulation is to examine if an egg is present in the reproductive tract (Heifetz et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2014). Variations in this assay range from quantifying ovulation rate by the percentage of females with an egg in their lower oviduct/common oviduct/uterus post mating (Lee et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2014), to examining the distribution of eggs in each of these separate regions over time (Heifetz et al., 2000). However, each of these assays could be influenced by the speed of oogenesis, ovulation, and oviposition. To account for all the possible drawbacks of each individual assay, we recently combined the egg-retention assay, the egg-laying assay, and the egg location in the female reproductive tract to estimate the average time for ovulating an egg (ovulation time; Sun and Spradling, 2013; Deady et al., 2015; Deady and Sun, 2015; Knapp and Sun, 2017; Deady et al., 2017). However, this method is tedious and also relies on the indirect measurements of ovulation.
Bio-protocol-2286	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2845	In vitro Analysis of Ubiquitin-like Protein Modification in Archaea	Archaea, Ubiquitin (Ub), Post-translational modification, SAMP Background The process by which ubiquitin (Ub) is covalently attached to target proteins is termed ubiquitination, which controls an enormous range of cellular process in eukaryotic cells (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Komander and Rape, 2012). Ubiquitination is catalyzed by a cascade of enzymes including an Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and Ub ligases (E3s). In vitro reconstitution of ubiquitination is a useful assay to determine the specificity between enzymes or between E3s and protein substrates (Zhao et al., 2012). In Archaea, the Ubl protein SAMP adopts a Ubfold and is isopeptide-linked to protein targets catalyzed by an E1-like enzyme UbaA reviewed in Maupin-Furlow, (2014). While E1 homologs are widespread in Archaea, canonical E2 or E3 enzymes are not predicted in most Archaea based on primary sequence comparisons. Our recent study of Haloferax volcanii, shows methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) is needed for Ubl protein modification (sampylation) together with UbaA under a mild oxidative condition in vivo and in vitro (Fu et al., 2017). Here, we describe a detailed in vitro protocol to reconstitute and analyze MsrA-dependent sampylation.
Bio-protocol-2287	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2844	Quantification of Salicylic Acid (SA) and SA-glucosides in Arabidopsis thaliana	Salicylic acid, SA-glucoside, Defense hormone, Arabidopsis thaliana, HPLC Background SA (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) is a plant hormone, which is synthesized in the chloroplast in response to pathogen attack. It is then exported to the cytoplasm, where it establishes both local and systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). In a generalized scheme, plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens is thought to be mediated through SA signaling, whereas resistance to necrotrophic pathogens is controlled by jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET). SA and JA/ET signaling pathways interact antagonistically. SA accumulation to high concentrations is toxic and leads to cell- and tissue damage. Most pathogen-induced SA is thus glycosylated by UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) to form hydrophilic, non-toxic SAG and SGE (Noutoshi et al., 2012; George Thompson et al., 2017). SAG and SGE are then sequestered in vacuoles, where they form reusable sources for hydrolysis to active SA. Increasing amounts of total SA (S A+S A G/S G E) in plant tissues thus reflect SA synthesis as a response to biotrophic pathogen attack. However, the amplitude of defense responses in infected plant tissues is determined by the amount of available cytoplasmic, unconjugated SA. To evaluate both the onset of SAdependent defense responses and their amplitude, it is essential to quantify free and conjugated SA, respectively. This article describes a method for measuring conjugated and unconjugated SA levels in phase-partitioned extracts from A. thaliana seedlings. It is based on a protocol established for SA analysis in cucumber leaves (Meuwly and Métraux, 1993), which we optimized and downscaled for convenient, routine use.

Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems (comprising types I, III, and IV) typically form multi-subunit protein-crRNA effector complexes, while the class 2 systems (comprising types II, V, and VI) rely on single crRNA-guided effector nucleases for target interference (Mohanraju et al., 2016).

A number of protocols exist for isolating DNA from algae (Weeks et al., 1986; Fawley and Fawley, 2004; HwangBo et al., 2010). Generally, cells are pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in buffer containing detergents such as SDS to solubilize membranes. This is followed by at least one extraction in phenol:chloroform and at least one extraction in chloroform. In some cases, an RNase treatment step is performed to degrade RNA. DNA is then precipitated by addition of ethanol or isopropanol and incubating on ice or in the freezer. After pelleting and washing the precipitated DNA, it is usually resuspended in water or buffer (e.g., Tris-EDTA) and quantified spectrophotometrically at 260n m .

Bio-protocol-2300	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2831	Assessing the Efficacy of Small Molecule Inhibitors in a	Murine norovirus, Persistent infection, Oral gavage, RT-qPCR, Antiviral Background Human noroviruses are an important cause of gastroenteritis. Although most norovirus infections  are  acute  and  self-limiting,  the  infection  can  become  chronic  in  patients  with  an immunodeficient status, particularly in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, patients undergoing chemotherapy and patients with AIDS (Westhoff et al., 2009; Green, 2014; Angarone et al., 2016). Prolonged norovirus infection is also observed in young children and the elderly resulting in an increased duration of illness, increased defecations and virus shedding for up to 47 days (Murata et al., 2007; Aoki et al., 2010). Reduction of immunosuppressive therapy is, when feasible, the strategy of choice to control the infection in transplant recipients. Specific antiviral therapies to treat (chronic) norovirus gastroenteritis are not available. To assess the inhibitory effect of small molecules on persistent norovirus infections, we used a mouse-adapted persistent murine norovirus (MNV.CR6) in type I and II interferon receptor knockout AG129 mice (Strong et al., 2012). MNV is a genogroup V norovirus that is widely used as a surrogate for human noroviruses, which comprises around 30 strains (Karst et al., 2003; Wobus et al., 2004). The MNV.CR6 is avirulent in AG129 and STAT 1^-/- mice, but replicates for weeks to months in wild type mice and to higher titers in innate immune-deficient mice (Thackray et al., 2007). The MNV.CR6 strain has a tropism for the proximal colon and the cecum, where it persists and replicates more efficiently than the MNV.CW3 strain, which causes acute infection (Arias et al., 2012; Nice et al., 2013).

In the light, their metabolism is centered on photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and the TCA cycle with Nassimilation; carbon is stored as glycogen. In the dark, glycogen is metabolized through glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, the oxidative and reductive branches of the TCA cycle, and the C4 cycle (Nagarajan et al., 2014). Thus, the shift from dark to light or light to dark drives metabolic reprogramming.

Bio-protocol-2308	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2823	Isolation and Maintenance of Murine Embryonic Striatal Neurons	Primary cultures, Striatum dissection, Striatal neurons, Medium spiny neurons Background Striatum is a critical component of the motor and reward systems and dysfunction of striatal neurons can lead to a variety of neuronal disorders, from obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors (Welch et al., 2007) to neurodegeneration, as observed in Huntington’s disease (Reiner et al., 1988). Therefore, a well-stablished striatal culture may be a great value as a model for studying these and other conditions. The major neuronal subtype in adult striatum is medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), which constitutes approximately 95% of all striatal neurons and use the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). They are characterized by medium-sized cell bodies, complex dendritic arbors and a high density of dendritic spines that receive both glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs. The remaining 5% of neurons are composed by GABAergic aspiny interneurons (Graveland and DiFiglia, 1985; Matamales et al., 2009). The following protocol describes the preparation of primary cultures of mouse embryonic striatal neurons with a low percentage of astrocytes, which proliferation is prevented by the mitosis inhibitor 5-fluoro-  -deoxyuridine (5-FdU). After 12 days in vitro (DIV) the striatal neurons obtained by the described protocol are expected to be immunolabeled for microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2) or NeuN, GABA and a large percentage for dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32).

Bio-protocol-2310	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2821	A Method for Extracting the Nuclear Scaffold from the Chromatin Network	Nuclei, Extract, Scaffold, Nucleophosmin-1, Chromatin Background Chromatins are densely and dynamically compacted in the nuclei through a complex scaffold of proteins and ribonucleoproteins. Unlike the cytoskeletal networks (Fischer and Fowler, 2015), microscopic observation of this nuclear scaffold is technically challenging. This may reflect the dominance of chromatins inside each nucleus with which the scaffold mingles and negotiates in the nucleus. The spherical arrangement of the nucleus also contributes to challenges in imaging such scaffold structures. A major element of the nuclear scaffold is the nuclear lamina (NL) (Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015). NL covers the surface of the entire nuclear chromatin mass on which the nuclear envelop (NE) attaches. The peripheral surface of the nuclear chromatin mass is characterized by dense heterochromatin (Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015). Inside the nucleus, one or more nucleoli can be found that occupy significant nuclear regions (Jordan and McGovern, 1981; Shaw and Jordan, 1995; Pederson, 2011). The nucleolar surface is also surrounded by a rim of dense chromatins and potentially functions as an important interior scaffold to support the chromatins (Chen et al., 2018). The morphology of the nucleoli changes dynamically depending on the stage of the cell cycle which can significantly affect the organization of nuclear chromatins (Hernandez-Verdun, 2011; Chen et al., 2018).

However, recent studies have uncovered an extensive lymphatic circulating system in the dura mater of rodents (Aspelund et al., 2015; Louveau et al., 2015), providing possible routes for the elimination of the brain’s waste products and for immune cells to access the deep cervical lymph nodes. In this protocol, we describe a way to: (1) visualize the lymphatic vessels in-vivo in the dura mater using MRI of the head, and (2) assess the local presence of lymphatic vessels using optimized immunostaining methods (Absinta et al., 2017). In-vivo imaging of lymphatics may enable more detailed studies of mechanisms of waste removal and immune function and their potential abnormalities in various diseases and aging.
Bio-protocol-2314	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2817	Generation of Luciferase-expressing Tumor Cell Lines	Lentivirus, Tumor, Lymphoma, Leukemia, Luciferase, GFP, Mouse, Methods Background Paramount to tracking cells in vivo is the ability to detect them externally by minimally invasive methods. Enzymatic bioluminescence using luciferase derived from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) is a widely used method for image-based cell tracking in vivo. Bioluminescence has been used for a variety of in vivo application including the noninvasive imaging of reporter gene expression (Herschman, 2004), studying circadian rhythms (Southern and Millar, 2005), imaging cerebral strokes (Vandeputte et al., 2014), and for tracking genetically engineered T cells (Costa et al., 2001; Cheadle et al., 2010). Perhaps the field where bioluminescent cell lines have been most applicable is oncology where they have been instrumental for the monitoring tumor growth (Jenkins et al., 2005; Brennan et al., 2016; Byrne et al., 2016) and tumor metastasis (Rosol et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2015) in mouse models. While some subcutaneously implanted tumors can be detected by palpation and measured with calipers, these methods are not effective for monitoring metastases or tracking tumors that disseminate widely, such as hematological malignancies that commonly grow in the bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. Firefly luciferase oxides luciferin in the presence of molecular oxygen, magnesium and adenosine triphosphate to produce yellow-green light at 560:n m (Wilson and Hastings, 1998; Fraga, 2008). Benefits of luciferase bioluminescence in cell tracking include penetration of tissue for non-invasive monitoring and the re-usability of the enzymatic marker. Another advantage of luciferases is that most cells are not luminescent such that high signal-to-noise ratios can be achieved. A limitation bioluminescence is photon attenuation caused by intervening tissues, such as skin, bone, or hair.

Bio-protocol-2317	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2814	Method for CRISPR/Cas9 Mutagenesis in Candida albicans	Candida albicans, Cas9, CRISPR, Fungal genetics, gRNA, Yeast Background C. albicans is a difficult organism to manipulate genetically. Since it normally exists as a diploid that does not readily undergo sexual reproduction, homozygous recessive mutations require sequential modification of each locus. The development and application of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repea ts (CRISPR) mutagenesis in C. albicans facilitates genetic manipulations because it allows simultaneous mutation of both alleles (Vyas et al., 2015; Min et al., 2016; Ng and Dean, 2017). CRISPR gene editing involves recruitment of an RNA-guided nuclease to a complementary target site adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (Jinek et al., 2012; Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). CRISPR associated (Cas) nuclease is targeted with high specificity through complementary base pairing between a guide RNA associated with trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), which binds Cas9 (Gasiunas et al., 2012). Since the chromosomal target sequence is only 20 nucleotides, expression of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) fused to a 80 nucleotide tracrRNA, along with Cas9, is sufficient for targeted double-strand DNA cleavage. Since chromosomal breaks are lethal, there is a strong selective pressure for double stranded break repair. In C. albicans, co-expression of a donor repair fragment, containing homology to regions flanking the break, oligonucleotides into pre-cut vectors allows repair of the break by homologous recombination. Thus, appropriate  design  of  the  donor  repair  fragment  allows  introduction  of  sequence  deletions, replacements or other chromosomal alterations.

For determination of intracellular osmolytes from cyanobacterial cells, several protocols have been established (Reed and Stewart, 1985; Hagemann et al., 1997; Motta et al., 2004; Du et al., 2013; Fa et al., 2015).
Bio-protocol-2320	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2811	Testing Effects of Chronic Chemogenetic Neuronal Stimulation on	Chemogenetics, DREADD, Energy expenditure, Food intake, Indirect calorimetry, TSE Background The POA is a central hub for body temperature homeostasis, which receives thermosensory information from the periphery and tunes the degree of sympathetic output to brown adipose tissue (BAT), cutaneous blood vessels, and heart to control the amount of heat generation and dissipation (Nakamura, 2011). We discovered that LepRb neurons in the POA are stimulated by warm ambient temperature and mediate warm-adaptive responses that include suppression of BAT thermogenesis and food intake (Yu et al., 2016). This discovery was made mainly through chemogenetic stimulation of POA LepRb neurons by virally expressing Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq, in POA LepRb neurons and injecting CNO in mice. A single IP injection of CNO can stimulate target neurons up to 10h (Krashes et al., 2011; Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014). This long-lasting CNO effect allows researchers to modulate target neuron activity chronically with two IP injections of CNO per day.

These communities have received several denominations over the decades, including normal flora, microbiota, and, more recently, microbiome (Sekirov et al., 2010; Kashyap et al., 2017). In humans, these vast microbial communities colonize our skin, respiratory tract, genitals, gastrointestinal tract, and many other sites. By far, the most heavily colonized site is the gastrointestinal tract, where trillions of microbes, encompassing several hundred species, coexist peacefully with their hosts. Some of these species knowingly live in symbiotic associations with the human organism, where both parts benefit from the interactions. For others, the relationship may be purely commensal, where the parts coexist without causing any harm to each other, but without providing or obtaining any benefit (Sekirov et al., 2010; Kundu et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2325	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2806	Quantification of Thrips Damage Using Ilastik and ImageJ Fiji	Insect resistance, Insect damage, Image analyses Background Quantification of insect damage is an essential measurement for identifying resistance in plants. In screening programs for host-plant resistance against thrips, the total damaged leaf area is used as a criterion to determine resistance levels. Thrips damage is characterized by silvery spots that show high contrast with the intact leaf area, but the feeding spots also include darker areas ranging from dark green to brown. These gradual discolorations of the leaf are too subtle to precisely quantify with programs such as Winfolia (http://www.regentinstruments.com/assets/winfolia_software.html) or ImageJ (Rasband, 2011) alone. As a result, thrips damage is commonly scored by individuals that rate the samples. Samples are classified into categories signifying the amount of damage (Mirnezhad et al., 2010; Maharijaya et al., 2011 and 2012), or damage is estimated to the nearest 1m m^2 (Leiss et al., 2009; Mirnezhad et al., 2010; Maharijaya et al., 2011 and 2012). These subjective measurements make comparison between studies/screening programs difficult. Moreover, they are time consuming and thus costly for breeding companies. Here we present an objective high-throughput standardized screening method to measure leaf surface damage caused by thrips using the freely available software programs ImageJ Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012) and Ilastik (Sommer et al., 2011). Ilastik has a wide range of applications ranging from cell biology (Fabrowski et al., 2013), where it is used to compute the amount of surface flattening of epithelial cells, to biomechanics (Bongiorno et al., 2014), where it is used to identify boundaries of human mesenchymal stem cells. It is an easy-to-use, self-learning image processing program that allows segmentation and classification of two-dimensional surfaces based on labels provided by the user (Sommer et al., 2011). ImageJ is often used to quantify the amount of removed leaf area by chewing herbivores and the total leaf surface of intact leaves (Meyer Hull-Sanders, 2008; Morrison and Lindell, 2012). However, it is rarely used to quantify feeding damage caused by thrips. Thrips feeding causes rather subtle discolorations on the leaves. ImageJ is limited in quantifying such color differences, for which Ilastik provides a more suitable alternative.

Although most commonly associated with pediatric diarrhea in developing countries, EAEC is also linked to diarrhea in immunocompromised adults, travelers and food-borne outbreaks in the industrialized world, such as the large lethal outbreak caused by a Shiga toxin (Stx) type 2a-producing EAEC strain of serotype O104:H4 in Northern Europe in 2011 (Harrington et al., 2006; Rasko et al., 2011). EAEC pathogenesis is determined by the organism’s ability to adhere to intestinal cells, produce enterotoxins and cytotoxins, and ultimately to induce inflammation (Harrington et al., 2006). EAEC adherence to intestinal cells is mediated by AAF fimbrial adhesins (Czeczulin et al., 1997). To date, at least five variants of the AAF fimbriae have been described, all encoded in virulence plasmids ranging from 55 to 65 MDa (Jonsson et al., 2015). The AAF structure is comprised by a positively charged major subunit and a putative minor subunit at the tip of fimbrial structures (Berry et al., 2014).
Bio-protocol-2330	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2801	Analysis of Mitochondrial Structure in the Body Wall Muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans	C. elegans, Mitochondria, Calcium, Mitochondrial membrane potential, TMRE, Mitotracker Background Mitochondria are involved in ATP production, cellular respiration, calcium buffering and reactive oxidative species (ROS) metabolism (Brookes et al., 2004). Mitochondrial structure and function are dynamic and closely linked, therefore analyzing mitochondrial structure can provide clues to the status of mitochondrial health (Sarasija and Norman, 2015). We developed two sets of protocols to assess mitochondrial structure in the body wall muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans. In the first protocol, we used transgenic ccIs4251 strain in which GFP is targeted to the matrix of the body wall muscle mitochondria to visualize the mitochondria (Fire et al., 1998). In the second protocol, we used mitochondrially targeted dyes, MitoTrackerTM Red CMXRos and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) to determine the structural integrity of the body wall muscle mitochondria. Normally, animals used in in-vivo imaging are anesthetized, however anesthetizing the animals could lead to mitochondrial morphological changes (Han et al., 2012), complicating data analysis. Our protocols allow for the in-vivo imaging of mitochondrial structure in live, un-anaesthetized nematodes.
Bio-protocol-2331	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2800	Measurement of ROS in Caenorhabditis elegans Using a Reduced Form of Fluorescein	C. elegans, ROS, Mitochondria, DCF, Oxidative stress, CM-H2DCFDA Background The life cycle of ROS is closely associated with the mitochondria. Superoxides are produced as a result of the inevitable electron leak at complex I and complex III from the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. This superoxide is then dismutated to hydrogen peroxide in the mitochondrial matrix and mitochondrial intermembrane space. The superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generated via these processes are considered to be ROS, with the mitochondria being responsible for 90% of endogenous ROS (Balaban et al., 2005). Therefore, measuring ROS levels will provide insight into the status of mitochondrial health. Here, we provide a protocol to determine the levels of ROS in the nematode C. elegans using CM-H2DCFDA, a cell-permeant chloromethyl derivative of a reduced form of fluorescein. Once inside the cell, the CM-H2DCFDA is cleaved by intracellular esterases and the resulting nonfluorescent H_2DCF , upon oxidation by ROS, gets converted into the highly fluorescent 2’,7’- dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Imaging and measurement of fluorescence intensity of H2DCFDA in live C. elegans can be confounded by the presence of autofluorescence from the animal’s intestine. Our protocol utilizes worm lysates to measure ROS levels, thereby bypassing this issue (Sarasija and Norman, 2015).

Small model animals, such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are suitable for understanding brain responses to odor stimuli at the levels of behavior, neural activity, and molecules because: (1) behavioral responses to odor stimuli can be easily recorded with inexpensive high resolution cameras; (2) responses in multiple neurons/neuronal groups can be measured with calcium imaging and (3) genes responsible for behavioral and neural responses can be identified with various genetic methods (De Bono and Maricq, 2005; Venken et al., 2011).

Some plant hormone peptides can affect proton transport, causing a strong alkalinization of the extracellular medium (Felix and Boller, 1995; Pearce et al., 2001a). The 5 kDa peptide hormone Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF), after being secreted, binds to its receptor FERONIA, and causes the phosphorylation of the plasma membrane H^+ -Adenosine triphosphatase 2, inhibiting proton transport and alkalinizing the extracellular media (Pearce et al., 2001b; Haruta et al., 2014).

Previously, this species has been described in the literature with the genera Muriella, Chlorella, and Mychonastes (Fučíková and Lewis, 2012). There are strong economic interests in C. zofingiensis because it is capable of producing large quantities of lipids for biofuels and shows promise as a source of the commercially valuable nutraceutical astaxanthin (Breuer et al., 2012; Mulders et al., 2014;  Liu  et  al.,  2016).  Recently,  a  high-quality,  chromosome-level  genome  assembly  and accompanying annotations were published, which facilitates systems level analyses like RNA-Seq (Roth et al., 2017). The following protocol was designed to produce highly purified total RNA, including miRNA, from liquid cultures of C. zofingiensis suitable for RNA-Seq.

Bio-protocol-2340	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2791	Fluorescein Transport Assay to Assess Bulk Flow of Molecules	Connectomics, Tissue architecture, Cellular networks, Bulk flow characterization Background The link between structure and function has always fascinated biologists, from the design spaces of organs (Eldredge, 1989) to the convergence or divergence of evolutionary paths (Morris, 2003). At a smaller scale, cells are also organized in a robust and tightly controlled manner, intimately related to the functions the tissue performs (Jackson et al., 2017a). The collection of cellular physical interactions that makes up a specific tissue can also be regarded as a network, a cellular connectome. This connectome is especially interesting in plants as shared cell walls impede cellular movement, thus the network dynamics depend only on cell death and replication.
Bio-protocol-2341	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2790	Primary Cultures from Human GH-secreting or Clinically Non-functioning Pituitary Adenomas Roberto Würth Alessandra Pattarozzi, Federica Barbieri and Tullio Florio*	Pituitary adenoma, Cancer stem cells, Primary cultures Background Pituitary adenomas are among the most common intracranial neoplasms (up to 15% ) and cross-sectional studies have found a prevalence of around 90 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with the vast majority being adults over 30 years old. Approximately 10% of unselected pituitaries examined at autopsy (i.e., considering also the pituitaries of subjects without previous diagnosis of pituitary disease) have developed adenomas (Molitch, 2017). Although often benign tumors, the management of pituitary adenomas can be complicated by the clinical syndromes related to hormone hypersecretion, or by the development of aggressive behavior characterized by resistance to treatment, high proliferation rate, rapid recurrence and extrasellar invasion (Carreno et al., 2017). The persistence of stem cells in adult pituitary (Florio, 2011) led to the hypothesis that the development of pituitary adenomas (and possibly of other benign neoplasia) can derive from subpopulations of tumor cells endowed with stem cell properties (mainly self-renewal and differentiation ability), as already established for malignant solid and hematologic tumors.
Bio-protocol-2342	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2789	Assessing Prepulse Inhibition of Startle in Mice	Prepulse inhibition of startle, PPI, Animal models, Schizophrenia, Sensorimotor gating Background Sensorimotor gating refers to the ability of a sensory event to suppress a motor response (Cryan and Reif, 2012). One form of sensorimotor gating that has been widely studied in humans and rodents is the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle. The startle reflex consists of involuntary contractions of whole-body musculature elicited by sufficiently sudden and intense stimuli. Specifically, the acoustic startle response is characterized by an exaggerated flinching response to an unexpected strong auditory stimulus. PPI is a form of startle plasticity and it is characterized by a normal reduction in startle magnitude that occurs when an intense startling stimulus (or pulse) is preceded by a brief, low intensity prestimulus (or prepulse) (Graham, 1975; Hoffman and Ison, 1980). The PPI paradigm is commonly used to evaluate sensorimotor gating and it has been described in numerous species, including humans (Schwarzkopf et al., 1993) and mice (Carter et al., 1999; Frankland et al., 2004). Impaired PPI is observed in schizophrenia (Braff et al., 2001; Swerdlow et al., 2008), as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders  including  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (Ahmari  et  al.,  2012),  Tourette’s  syndrome (Swerdlow et al., 2001), Huntington’s disease (Swerdlow et al., 1995) and bipolar disorder (Perry et al., 2001). In patients with psychotic disorders, deficits in sensorimotor gating are associated with cognitive fragmentation and psychotic symptoms (Kapur, 2003). As these deficits have been found both in psychotic patients as well as in animal models (Swerdlow and Light, 2016), the PPI paradigm is largely used in the study of neuropsychiatric diseases and has proven a useful tool for studying and characterizing the effects of several anti-psychotics (Xue et al., 2012), and for exploring the mechanisms underlying psychotic-like behaviors (Geyer, 1999; Ouagazzal et al., 2001).
Bio-protocol-2343	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2788	Imaging Cytokine Concentration Fields Using PlaneView Imaging Devices	Cytokine concentration, Cytokine niches, Imaging of cytokine fields Background The mammalian immune system has evolved to identify and limit the spread of potential pathogens while minimizing collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. To achieve this, immune cells rely on a network of cytokine mediators that enable cell-to-cell communications and broadcast information about the magnitude and nature of the pathogenic insult. Vast arrays of different cytokines bind strongly to their cognate receptors, often with characteristic binding affinities in the nanoor pico-molar range. Immunological niches are generated via cytokine communications. For example, in both the bone marrow and the thymus, secretion of Interleukin-7 (IL-7) by stromal cells supports the survival of proliferating B and T cell progenitors, respectively (Tokoyoda et al., 2004; Alves et al., 2009). The size of the cytokine niche controls the number of maturing progenitors, thereby keeping the blood cell compartments in equilibrium (Böyum, 1968; Weist et al., 2015).
Bio-protocol-2344	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2787	Bacterial Competition Assay Based on Extracellular D-amino Acid Production	D-amino acid, Competition, Co-cultivation, Viability, D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) assay Background Bacteria live in polymicrobial communities where a great diversity of species coexist and compete for the available resources. One of the many tactics that bacteria have devised to persist in a specific niche is the production of toxic extracellular metabolites as a strategy to interfere with growth and/or viability of other microbes. D-amino acids have been known for a long time to have a powerful effect in cell shape and viability in bacterial cultures (Bopp, 1965; Fox et al., 1944; Kobayashi et al., 1948; Yaw and Kakavas, 1952; Lark and Lark, 1959; Grula, 1960; Tuttle and Gest, 1960). However, it has not been until recently that D-amino acids have gained physiological meaning when it was reported that many taxonomically unrelated bacteria could release millimolar concentrations of non-canonical Damino acids (NCDAAs) to the extracellular medium (Lam et al., 2009). Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholerae, presents a periplasmic broad spectrum racemase called BsrV reported to produce a great variety of D-amino acids, mainly D-Met and D-Leu (Lam et al., 2009; Cava et al., 2011). Further studies demonstrated that the main mode of action of these D-amino acids was through their incorporation into the peptidoglycan polymer, an essential bacterial structure that plays a role in morphology determination and cell integrity (Caparros et al., 1992; Lam et al., 2009; Cava et al., 2011). Peptidoglycan is a macromolecule composed of glycan chains crosslinked by short peptides.

Extensive work in animal models has investigated the pathophysiological state of spinal circuits after SCI. Most studies in spinal cord injury are carried out in animal models relevant for clinical evaluation of motor impairment and recovery after SCI (Sharif-Alhoseini et al., 2017). One of the main limitations of these models is the difficulty to relate clinical features of sensory-motor dysfunction to specific cellular mechanism(s). In the last decade, new insights into possible cellular mechanisms underlying motor impairments after SCI have come from transection models of SCI. Here, the sacral spinal cord is surgically transected resulting in paralysis only of the tail muscles. This model was first introduced in cats (Ritz et al., 1992), and later in rats (Bennett et al., 1999), and has provided insights into cellular mechanisms underlying sensory-motor dysfunction after injury (Bennett et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the genetic tools for manipulating  neuronal  activity  in  cats  and  rats  are  very  limited.  In  contrast,  mice  allow electrophysiology to be combined with genetics for identification and manipulation of the activity of specific neurons in the spinal cord (Jiang and Heckman, 2006; Kiehn, 2016). In recent efforts, these advantages have allowed optical approaches (e.g., optogenetics, calcium imaging of defined neuronal subtypes) to be used for dissection of the neural mechanisms underlying muscle spasms after SCI (Bellardita et al., 2017). In this protocol, we describe the technical aspects of sacral spinal cord transection in adult mice, and the subsequent use of in vitro sacral spinal cord preparations for direct examination of the neural mechanisms which cause spasm in chronic spinal cord injury.
Bio-protocol-2348	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2783	A Microfluidic Device for Massively Parallel,	Cellular aging, Lifespan, Microdissection, Microfluidics, Lithography, Fabrication Background Cellular aging results in the cumulative decline of cellular function that eventually leads to mortality. Most studies of cellular aging focus on the replicative lifespan of model unicellular organisms, such as budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Nyström and Liu, 2014; Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014; Wierman and Smith, 2014; Ruetenik and Barrientos, 2015). The replicative lifespan (RLS) of a cell is defined as the number of daughters produced by a mother cell over the course of its life (Henderson and Gottschling, 2008; Sutphin et al., 2014). RLS studies have greatly expanded our understanding of cellular aging in mitotically active cells. For example, in budding yeast, old mothers preferentially retain misfolded proteins and other cellular senescence factors from the budding daughter cells (Aguilaniu et al., 2003; Hughes and Gottschling, 2012; Liu et al., 2010; Saka et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014; Paoletti et al., 2016). This feat is achieved by restricting the flow of these ‘senescence factors’ across the bud septum, preventing their accumulation in the rejuvenated daughters (Shcheprova et al., 2008; HiguchiSanabria et al., 2014). Whether senescence factors are also segregated in symmetrically dividing cells is unclear (Wang et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2013; Nakaoka and Wakamoto, 2017). Indeed, relatively little is known about the mechanisms and causes of aging in symmetrically dividing cells.

After initial infection, KSHV establishes a persistent life-long infection in the host that is particularly problematic to the immune-compromised individuals. KSHV can cause various tumors in HIV/AIDS patients including Kaposi’s sarcoma, and multiple B-cell lymphomas (Chang et al., 1994; Cesarman et al., 1995; Russo et al., 1996; Soulier et al., 1995). With a large genome of about 165,000 bp, which encodes nearly 90 different open reading frames, KSHV has ample tools to evade the host immune surveillance system, alter host-cell growth pathways and produce infectious progeny virions.
Bio-protocol-2351	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2780	Isolation of Commensal Escherichia coli Strains from Feces of Healthy Laboratory Mice or Rats	Commensal, Escherichia coli, Isolation, Laboratory rodents Background Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe which constitutes only a minor fraction of the vertebrate gut microbiota, but plays a key role in microbial interaction, immune modulation and metabolic functionalities (Tenaillon et al., 2010). Being one of the best-characterized model microorganisms, commensal E. coli strains have been increasingly studied to unravel the mechanisms through which gut commensal microbes adapt to the unique niche and impact host physiology. However, the high homology among different strains raises difficulties in identification and characterization of commensal E. coli based on a 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Thanks to the development of nextgeneration sequencing techniques and large-scale analyses of whole genomes, we are able to identify commensal E . coli strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of different hosts according to the presence of virulence genes in the genome. In this protocol, we show an approach to isolate and identify commensal E. coli strains from a laboratory mouse or rat using selective culture media and whole genome sequencing. However, it should be noted that the presence of commensal E. coli in laboratory animals depends on the vendor and environmental conditions of the facility.

Bio-protocol-2353	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2778	Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing in Maize	Bisulfite sequencing, DNA methylation, Epigenetics, Maize, Methylome Background DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that plays an important role in many developmental processes of animals, plants and fungi by regulating gene expression and the chromatin structure (Law and Jacobsen, 2010). WGBS is a genome-wide scale method for profiling DNA methylation at single-base resolution, although high sequencing costs are required to achieve sufficient coverage (Cokus et al., 2008). In mammals, RRBS has been developed to specifically sequence CGdense regions, e.g., CpG islands (Smith et al., 2009). In this protocol, we aimed to adapt RRBS for plants. To be specific, we developed an in silico pipeline (Figure 1) to performed enzyme selection by targeting specific genome regions to generate RRBS methylomes and provided an experimental validation protocol.
Bio-protocol-2354	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2777	Spared Nerve Injury Model of Neuropathic Pain in Mice	Mouse pain model, SNI surgery, Peripheral nerve injury, Sciatic nerve, Neuropathic pain Background Partial nerve injury animal models have been developed for the purpose of studying the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of neuropathic pain (Bennett and Xie, 1988; Seltzer et al., 1990; Kim and Chung, 1992). A partial denervation model enables researchers to investigate structural and functional changes in diverse groups of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Studies can be performed during the initiation, progression (also known as acute) and maintenance (chronic) phases of neuropathic pain, as well as at different anatomical sites along the pain pathway including distal vs. proximal peripheral nerve fibers, dorsal root ganglion, spinal cord, subcortical and cortical areas. The spared nerve injury (SNI) model involves partial nerve injury where the common peroneal and tibial nerves are injured, producing consistent and reproducible pain hypersensitivity in the territory of the spared sural nerve (Decosterd and Woolf, 2000; Shields et al., 2003). This model has proved to be robust, demonstrating substantial and prolonged changes in behavioral measures of mechanical sensitivity and thermal responsiveness (Bourquin et al., 2006). These features closely mimic the cardinal symptoms of clinically described neuropathic pain disorders.

Bio-protocol-2356	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2775	Detection and Analysis of Circular RNAs by RT-PCR	Circular RNA, Backsplice junction, Divergent primer, RT-PCR, RNase R Background CircRNAs are covalently closed, single-stranded RNAs lacking 5’ or acute3 ends. Although their genesis is poorly understood, they can arise from pre-mRNAs by a process called backsplicing (Panda et al., 2017d; Jeck et al., 2013). CircRNAs have been reported to be abundant, ubiquitously expressed, and conserved across species (Jeck et al., 2013). A number of studies have established that circRNAs can regulate gene expression by acting as competitors of pre-mRNA splicing, as decoys for microRNAs, as sponges for RBPs, and possibly also as substrates for translation (Panda et al., 2017d). In recent years, more than one hundred thousand circRNAs have been reported bioinformatically from high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Glazar et al., 2014). Unfortunately, there is little overlap among different bioinformatic pipelines and there is no ‘gold standard’ method to validate the accuracy of circRNAs identified by different bioinformatic tools (Szabo and Salzman, 2016). However, RT-PCR has been widely used for validation of circRNAs identified by RNA-seq. This protocol describes the design of divergent primers which face away from each other on the linear RNA, so that they can only amplify the circRNAs, and not the linear RNAs with the same sequence. The PCR amplicon for the detection of circRNAs using divergent primers spans the backsplice junction of circRNAs. This method has been successfully used in several studies for the detection and quantification of circRNAs.
Bio-protocol-2357	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2774	Measurement of Intracellular ROS in Caenorhabditis elegans Using	Reactive oxygen species, 2’,7’-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate, C. elegans, Antioxidant Background In situ detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the living organism using fluorescent probe 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) has been broadly performed by those researchers who work in the field of oxidative stress and related diseases. The nonpolar and non-ionic probe, H2DCFDA, can easily penetrate the cellular membrane and is enzymatically deacetylated by esterases. This biochemical reaction turns H2DCFDA into the non-fluorescent compound H2DCF which is then rapidly oxidized to highly fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of ROS (Figure 1A). Therefore, fluorescence signals from H2DCFDA probe demonstrate important information for the quantification of ROS at single cell level (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). The Caenorhabditis elegans model system provides an excellent in vivo experimental environment for evaluating molecular mechanisms of ROS pathophysiology due to their short lifespan, simplicity, and ease of genetic manipulation (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; Miranda-Vizuete and Veal, 2017; Yoon et al., 2017) (Figure 1B). Here, we describe a simple protocol to measure the levels of time-course ROS generation in C. elegans using H2DCFDA under normal and heat- or chemicallyinduced oxidative stress conditions. Using this protocol, we determined the effects of H2DCFDA concentration and number of tested worms on DCF fluorescence signal (Figure 2).

Bio-protocol-2359	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2772	Alphavirus Purification Using Low-speed Spin Centrifugation	Enveloped virus purification, Centrifugation, Assembly mutants Background Virus purification is traditionally based on chemical precipitation (e.g., PEG) or density gradient centrifugation. Centrifugation protocols involve pelleting particles at high speeds (>100,000x g) ) or through sedimentation matrices such as cesium, Nycodenz, Iodixanol, sucrose, glycerol, or tartrate. After sedimentation in the gradient, the purified virus sample usually requires additional steps to remove the gradient matrix, concentrate the purified particles, and buffer exchange into a stabilizing buffer for downstream applications. These approaches include dialysis, centrifugation through a centrifugal filter, or PEG precipitation. While these approaches will produce purified particles, there are several drawbacks: (1) overall yields can be low, (2) time required for the purification can extend to a week, (3) morphologically heterogeneous particles are not purified with equal efficiency, (4) particles can be damaged in the process, and (5) assembly mutants often do not survive the purification process making certain downstream analyses challenging.
Bio-protocol-2360	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2771	Quantification of Colibactin-associated Genotoxicity in HeLa Cells by	Colibactin, Infection, Escherichia coli, Genotoxin, DNA damage, γ-H2AX Background The genotoxin colibactin is a polyketide nonribosomal peptide hybrid compound produced by several species of Enterobacteriaceae. This toxin, synthesized by a machinery encoded on a 54 kb genomic locus, the pks island, induces DNA damages, cell cycle arrest, senescence and death in eukaryotic cells (Nougayrède et al., 2006; Taieb et al., 2016). The genotoxic activity of colibactin is dependent on a direct host cell-bacteria interaction and cannot be recapitulated from culture supernatant, killed bacteria, or bacterial lysates instead of life bacteria. Visualization and quantification of the colibactin genotoxic effect on eukaryotic cells can be assessed by quantification of the megalocytosis phenotype (for a protocol see Bossuet-Greif et al., 2017) or quantification of the doublestrand DNA breaks in the host cell nucleus by a comet assay (revealing DNA fragmentation) or phosphorylation of the H2AX histone, a marker of double-strand DNA breaks. The phosphorylation of the histone H2AX is characterized as an early and sensitive reaction to genotoxic agents (Audebert et al., 2010). H2AX phosphorylation was demonstrated to be 10-100 times more sensitive than the comet assay in vitro as well as in vivo (Audebert et al., 2010). The quantification of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) can be processed by the In-Cell Western Assay, an immunochemical assay that uses fluorescence to detect and quantify proteins in fixed cells (Audebert et al., 2010). Here we describe an adapted assay allowing the measurement of γ-H2AX in 96-well plate using In-Cell Western, following a short infection of cultured mammalian cells with colibactin-producing bacteria (Martin et al., 2013; Bossuet-Greif et al., 2016; Tronnet et al., 2017).

ISH enables the analysis of spatio-temporal gene expression in vivo in whole-mount Meloidogyne spp. nematodes. These root-knot nematodes hatch in the soil as microscopic vermiform juveniles (J2) and infect host plant roots. J2s penetrate the root and migrate to the root vascular cylinder cells. The juveniles settle in the root and develop into J3 and J4 parasitic juveniles that induce the differentiation specialized feeding cells. The nematode eventually develops into a pear-shaped female that will release hundreds of eggs on the root surface. Here, we report a detailed protocol to detect single RNA molecules in preparasitic whole mount J2s and parasitic stages. ISH on parasitic stages requires an additional procedure the day before extraction of the nematodes from infected roots. We describe the detection of transcripts using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probes in nematode whole mount tissues.

The embryonic hippocampus is even more inaccessible, requiring in utero surgical methods for experimental manipulation. Organotypic slice cultures circumvent this problem and at the same time retain many aspects of hippocampal field cytoarchitectonics, including molecular features and connectivity. While there are protocols that describe postnatal culturing of hippocampal explants from rodent brains (Stoppini et al., 1991; Opitz-Araya and Barria, 2011) these do not include genetic manipulation of the cells. The preparation of organotypic explants from the embryonic mouse hippocampus was first described in Tole et al. (1997). We extended this protocol by introducing ex-vivo electroporation of the embryonic brain prior to preparing the organotypic slices. Electroporation of the intact brain after introducing DNA into the telencephalic ventricle ensures that cells residing in and near the ventricular zone are targeted, and therefore provides an excellent means of inducing transgenesis in hippocampal progenitors. Data using this protocol were published in Subramanian et al. (2011). Here, we present detailed step-wise instructions including experimental ‘dos and don’ts’, and also illustrate key steps using photographs and movies, to aid new researchers in setting up this useful procedure. Some advantages and applications of this protocol are:
Bio-protocol-2368	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2763	Microbial Mutagenicity Assay: Ames Test	Mutagenicity, Carcinogenicity, Salmonella strains, Gene mutation, Revertants Background The Microbial Ames test is a simple, rapid and robust bacterial assay consisting of different strains and applications of Salmonella typhimurium/E. coli, used for ascertaining the mutagenic potential (Levin et al., 1982; Gupta et al., 2009). In 1975, Ames and his followers standardized the traditional Ames assay protocol and reappraised in 1980’s (Maron and Ames, 1983). Induction of new mutations replacing existing mutations allows restoring of gene function. The newly formed mutant cells are allowed to grow in the absence of histidine and form colonies, hence this test is also called as ‘Reversion assay’ (Ames, 1971). While traditional Ames test is quite laborious and time consuming for initial monitoring of mutagenic compounds, miniaturization of liquid suspension significantly impacted the usability by making it more convenient. The standard doses (2ul,5ul,10ul,50ul and 100ul ) were set to evaluate the mutagenicity from lower to higher concentration (Hayes, 1982). Mice liver has been used as a tissue for preparing homogenate 9,000 x g (S9 hepatic fraction) whereas in S9 m i x hepatocytes are used to minimize the mammalian metabolic activation formed in the mice liver. In Ames bioassay, the sensitivity of a compound for mutagenicity is based on the knowledge that a substance which is mutagenic in the presence of liver enzymes metabolizing compound might be a carcinogen (Mathur et al., 2005).

PG is composed by glycan chains connected by short peptides. The PG from different species varies in the structure of the peptides and presence of secondary modifications (Vollmer et al., 2008). PG precursors are synthesized inside the cell and equipped with a carrier lipid for transport across the membrane prior to their polymerization at the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane (Barreteau et al., 2008). The universal bacterial carrier lipid is undecaprenyl phosphate ( 'C55- P) ), which is synthesized in two steps. First, UppS uses farnesyl pyrophosphate (C_15^-P P) and eight isopentenyl pyrophosphate (C5-P P) molecules to produce the diphosphate form of the carrier lipid (C55- P P) , which is then dephosphorylated to C55-P by membrane embedded phosphatases (UppP, or PAP2- type phosphatases) (Manat et al., 2014).

The ‘classical’ splice mutations are those affecting the canonical sequences defining the 5 and z -splice sites (donor and acceptor splice sites, respectively). However, splice mutations can also occur in other non-coding and coding regions (Wang and Cooper, 2007; Scotti and Swanson, 2016). There is growing evidence that the frequency of splice mutations in coding regions (exonic mutations) has been underestimated (Julien et al., 2016; Soukarieh et al., 2016). Exonic splice mutations (i.e., point mutations, insertions or deletions) can induce exon skipping, intron retention or lead to the generation of novel donor or acceptor splice sites. Depending on the gene and exon composition, these mechanisms can have different impacts on the protein level ranging from haploinsufficiency to gain of function. Nevertheless, the exact knowledge of molecular mechanisms underpinning the diseasecausing mutations is essential for developing optimal treatments.

Bio-protocol-2373	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2758	Quantification of Plant Cell Death by Electrolyte Leakage Assay	Plants, Cell death, Electrolyte leakage, Electrolytic conductivity Background When a cell dies and loses the integrity of the cell membrane, electrolytes, such as K^+ ions, leak out of the cell. Thus, we can use the amount of electrolytes leaked from a tissue as a proxy for the extent of cell death in the tissue. A simple way to quantify such electrolytes leaked from a tissue is to measure the increase in electrolytic conductivity of water that contains the tissue with dying cells. This electrolyte leakage assay has been applied to plant tissues to assess the relative quantity of cells that died in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen challenge, insect herbivory, wounding, UV radiation, oxidative stress, salinity, drought, cold and heat stress (Demidchik et al., 2014).

Bio-protocol-2376	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2755	Boron Uptake Assay in Xenopus laevis Oocytes	Boric acid, Boron, ICP-MS, NIP, Xenopus leavis oocytes Background Boron is essential for plant growth but is toxic when it is accumulated. Boron has structural  functions  in  the  cell  wall  through  cross-linking  of  pectic  polysaccharides  at rhamnogalacturonan II regions (Funakawa and Miwa, 2015). In solution, B exists primarily as boric acid at physiological pH B(O H)_3+H_2OrightarrowB(O H)_4^-+H^+ ( pKa=9.24) . Boric acid is a small neutral molecule and thus shows significant passive diffusion across biological membranes (Dordas et al., 2000). In addition, plants utilize boric acid channels belonging to major intrinsic protein (MIP, aquaporin) family and borate exporters (BOR family) to maintain B homeostasis (Takano et al., 2008).

In eukaryotic cells, the mRNA 3’ end formation is through a cleavage from an internal phosphodiester bond, followed by the addition of a poly (A) tail; whereas in prokaryotic cells, the acute3 ends of mRNAs are generated by termination of transcription or by processing of the primary transcript (Altman and Robertson, 1973; Nudler and Gottesman, 2002; Zhao et al., 1999). Therefore, it is important to analyze the exact position and relative quantity of mRNA acute3 end to understand the mechanism of mRNA generation.

Most CpG dinucleotides in the genome are methylated, including those located in gene regulatory regions such as enhancers. However, when required, these CpGs can be demethylated through oxidation of the methyl group by Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes and replacement by unmethylated cytosines by the base excision repair system. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the first oxidative derivative of 5-methylcytosine, and mapping this modified base in the genome provides information on the regions undergoing active demethylation. Although selective chemical labeling (SCL) allows very specific detection of 5hmC, the resolution of this technique is limited by the size of the DNA fragments, especially when several CpGs are present in the captured DNA. In order to improve resolution, we have introduced a digestion step using exonucleases which trim the DNA molecule up to close proximity of the hydroxymethylated cytosines (Sérandour et al., 2016). Appropriate bioinformatic treatment of the sequencing reads then assigns hydroxymethylation score to the captured CpGs.

Best studied histone modifications include methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination  and  sumoylation.  However,  enzymes  introducing  or  removing  specific  histone modifications are not always known. Powerful in vitro assays can establish the catalytic potential of histone modifying enzymes but in vivo methods are desirable to confirm that in vitro specificity reflects in vivo activity. Here, we describe a flexible protocol to test activity of histone modifying enzymes in the plant N. benthamiana. Although we used the protocol to test activity of ubiquitin specific protease (UBP) on ubiquitylated H2A, it can also easily be adopted to other histone modifications for which specific antibodies are available.

Drechs. anamorph = Bipolaris maydis (Nisikado) Shoemaker, is a widespread maize disease which causes significant yield losses in hot, humid tropical and sub-tropical regions, such as the southeastern USA, parts of India, Africa, Latin America and Southern Europe. In 1970-71 an SLB epidemic caused by C. heterostrophus race T infecting hybrids carrying Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) caused an estimated 15% loss in total maize production in the US (Ullstrup, 1972). After the 1970 epidemic, cmsT maize was replaced by race T-resistant, normal cytoplasm maize.
Bio-protocol-2387	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2744	Barnes Maze Procedure for Spatial Learning and Memory in Mice	Spatial memory, Mouse, Hippocampus, Cognition, Behavior Background The Barnes maze is a dry-land based behavioral test that was originally developed by Carol Barnes to study spatial memory in rats (Barnes, 1979) and later adapted for use in mice (Bach et al., 1995). Conceptually, it is similar to the Morris water maze (MWM) (Morris, 1984), in that it is a hippocampal-dependent task where animals learn the relationship between distal cues in the surrounding environment and a fixed escape location. For mice, the typical Barnes maze setup consists of an elevated circular platform with 40 evenly-spaced holes around the perimeter. An escape tunnel is mounted underneath one hole while the remaining 39 holes are left empty. Both bright light and open spaces are aversive to rodents, thus serve as motivating factors to induce escape behavior. The escape tunnel is maintained at a fixed location for the duration of training, which involves multiple daily trials spread over several days. During the course of training, rodents typically utilize a sequence of three different search strategies (random, serial, spatial) to learn the location of the escape tunnel. Following sufficient acquisition training, the escape tunnel is removed and a probe trial is administered to assess spatial reference memory.
Bio-protocol-2388	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2743	Murine Pancreatic Islets Transplantation under the Kidney Capsule	Type 1 diabetes, Pancreatic islets, Islet transplantation, Murine model Background Many alternative sites for islet implantation have been reported so far in small animal models and the ideal site must be selected according to the technical advantages of the procedure to be used and for the purpose of the experiments. Bearing in mind that the kidney capsule is an extravascular site and it is not immunoprotected, pancreatic islet transplantation under the kidney capsule remains a surgical procedure with low mortality rates leading to hyperglycemia reversion within a few days. In addition, transplantation under the kidney capsule allows histological studies and formal demonstration of islet function (Cantarelli and Piemonti, 2011; Elisa Cantarelli et al., 2013).
Bio-protocol-2389	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2742	Flight and Climbing Assay for Assessing Motor Functions in Drosophila	Tethers, Air-puff, Cold anaesthesia, Cylinder Background Coordinated motor functions are important for every mobile organism for survival as the major needs of finding food, shelter, mates and escaping from predators involve motor activity. Here we describe protocols to assess the flight and climbing ability of both individual and groups of Drosophila melanogaster. Both these protocols have been used extensively in earlier studies (Agrawal and Hasan, 2015; Pathak et al., 2015; Richhariya et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2390	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2741	Quantification of Bacterial Attachment to Tissue Sections	Host-pathogen interactions, Bacterial attachment, Bacterial colonization Background Many types of bacteria, both commensal and pathogenic, express various adhesion molecules, allowing them binding to different surfaces of the host (Gur et al., 2015; Abed et al., 2016; Isaacson et al., 2017). This adhesion is crucial, as it is the first step of colonization and plays a role in both competition and survival, in different environments (Schilling et al., 2001). Many of these adhesins are lectins, binding sugar moieties on glycoproteins on various kinds of cells, such as epithelial cells and others (Abed et al., 2016; Isaacson et al., 2016). Over the years, many groups studying host-pathogen interactions used cell lines and tissue culture in order to try to understand bacterial adhesion to cells. Tissue sections give a more physiological context to the colonization study, as they provide organization and structures that are almost impossible to obtain using in vitro tissue culture. Furthermore, in immortalized or cancerous cells, the expression pattern of surface molecules, to which bacteria can bind, might be altered. In order to better understand physiological context of bacterial adherence, in both normal and pathological conditions, we chose to employ bacterial attachment to tissue sections.
Bio-protocol-2391	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2740	Plate Assay to Determine Caenorhabditis elegans Response to	Attractant, Aversive stimulus, Chemosensory behavior, Learning and memory, Plate assay Background The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has extensively been used as a model organism for the study of animal behaviors. C. elegans senses a variety of water-soluble and volatile chemicals that are mainly mediated by amphids, the largest chemosensory organs (Ward, 1973; Dusenbery, 1974; Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991; Bargmann et al., 1993). It is essential for the behavioral study to determine precise concentrations of chemicals that can be sensed by C. elegans. To determine optimal concentrations of water-soluble attractants for C. elegans, Wicks et al. (2000) used a quadrant agar plate for the behavioral assay in which a chemical of interest was mixed with agar in two compartments and this assay has widely been used for many chemicals (e.g., Jansen et al., 2002; Ortiz et al., 2009; Murayama and Maruyama, 2013; Sassa et al., 2013). Chemotaxis assay has also been used to measure the sensitivity of C. elegans to volatile compounds spotted on an agar plate (Bargmann et al., 1993; Troemel et al., 1997). C. elegans is also an excellent model organism for the study of associative learning and memory, in which water-soluble chemicals and volatile chemicals were used as an unconditioned stimulus (US) and a conditioned stimulus (CS) (Amano and Maruyama, 2011; Nishijima and Maruyama, 2017). For effective conditioning of worms, concentrations of CS and US are crucial parameters. The resource localization assay with quadrant agar plates and a chemotaxis assay on square agar plates were successfully used to define optimal concentrations of US and CS for the study of learning and memory. Therefore, these assays could be applied for many other attractive and repulsive chemicals in C. elegans behavioral analysis.

They exist in many tissues (Hass et al., 2011) and have been observed to be perivascular in vivo (Caplan and Correa, 2011). The niche of the source or the source itself, could lead to important functional differences between the various MSC types (Kwon et al., 2016). Though bone marrow is the most well studied and best characterized source of MSCs, there are certain limitations associated with it (Liu et al., 2016). An appealing and convenient alternative choice of MSC source is the fetus-derived umbilical cord, which is discarded after birth and provides an easily accessible and non-controversial source of stem cells for therapy (El Omar et al., 2014). Umbilical cord MSC-based trials are still at early phase, though no cell rejection, tumor formation or long-term adverse effects have been reported from them (Zhang et al., 2017). Moreover, they have been successfully used in experimental animal disease models. For convincingly establishing safety and therapeutic efficacy of umbilical cord-MSCs, followed by their use in clinical applications, a vast number of MSCs need to be generated for transplantations (Bartmann et al., 2007).

Bio-protocol-2401	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2730	Sebinger Culture: A System Optimized for Morphological Maturation and Imaging of Cultured Mouse Metanephric Primordia	Organ culture, Kidney, Metanephros, Sebinger culture, Organoid, Imaging Background The metanephric (permanent) kidneys of mammals develop from simple rudiments located at the caudal end of the intermediate mesoderm. In mice, at about embryonic day (‘E’) 10 these rudiments form and consist of two morphologically distinguishable components; an epithelial ureteric bud that arises as a diverticulum of the Wolffian (nephric) duct, and a metanephrogenic mesenchyme that forms next to the duct. As development progresses, the ureteric bud enters the metanephrogenic mesenchyme and undergoes many successive rounds of growth and branching to make a ‘tree’; this later remodels to produce a mature collecting duct system in which tubules radiate from a central cavity, the renal pelvis (Lindstrom et al., 2015). The renal pelvis drains to the ureter, which forms from the original stalk of the ureteric bud. As the ureteric bud develops, it induces cells from the metanephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around each of its tips to form a ‘cap mesenchyme’ (Schreiner, 1902; Reinhoff, 1922). The cap mesenchymes are stem cell populations that divide as the tips divide, so that each tip formed by bifurcation of an existing branch inherits its own cap (reviewed by Hendry et al., 2011). Cells at the more distal ends of the caps differentiate to form excretory nephrons, which connect to the ureteric bud branch from whose cap they formed (Georgas et al., 2009). Blood vessels invade from the base of the metanephros and follow the ureteric bud, making a network around (but never entering) the cap mesenchymes (Munro et al., 2017): later, these vessels will serve glomeruli and other parts of the kidney. In vitro culture of metanephric kidney rudiments has a long history. Indeed, these were among the first embryonic organs to show continued development outside the body (Carrel and Burrows, 1910). The continued development of kidney rudiments outside of the body was a scientific, as well as a technical, advance: the autonomous development of isolated organs demonstrated that the information required to build them was ‘local’ and did not depend on the rest of the embryo. This observation added considerable support to the idea that architecture of the body is hierarchical, with modules (organs) that largely look after themselves and interact with the rest of the body only at specific functional interfaces. The earliest culture methods used rather complex media and culture supports, such as Grobstein’s use of clotted avian plasma and chick embryo extract (Grobstein, 1953). These systems were necessary because simply placing a kidney rudiment in a glass dish or flask resulted in its breakdown because cells adhered to the substrate and spread out to form a monolayer. Immersion in medium in nonadhesive dishes prevents cell dispersal but does not result in proper development (see ‘Data analysis’ section). Both imaging and reproducibility were greatly improved by Saxén’s adoption of a culture method developed by Trowell for culture of rat lymph nodes (Trowell, 1954). Saxén placed embryonic kidney rudiments, isolated from mice at E11, on filters that were supported by a stainless steel grid at the interface between gas and medium (Saxén et al., 1962).

Seedling Roots	Plant, Chromosome, Replication, EdU, Click-chemistry Background Most data concerning chromosome organization have been acquired from studies of a small number of model organisms, the majority of which are mammals. In plants with large genomes, the chromosomes are significantly larger than the animal chromosomes that have been studied to date. To investigate the chromosome dynamics during mitosis, it is necessary to mark the discrete chromosome foci and then analyze their spatial rearrangements during prophase condensation and telophase decondensation. To label the chromosome regions, we incorporated the synthetic nucleotide, 5-ethynyl- .z' -deoxyuridine  (EdU)  (Kuznetsova  et  al.,  2017).  Detection  of  EdU  is  based  on  a click-reaction, which is a copper catalyzed reaction between an azide and an alkyne. The EdU contains the alkyne which can react with the azide-containing detection reagent.
Bio-protocol-2406	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2725	Preparation of Precisely Oriented Cryosections of Undistorted Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs for High Resolution Confocal Imaging	Cryosection, Frozen sections, Confocal microscopy, Wing imaginal disc, Drosophila Background Third instar imaginal discs are flat pocket-like involutions of the epidermis (Cohen, 1993; McClure and Schubiger, 2005). One layer of this pocket, the ‘disc proper’, is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that is heavily folded at the onset of metamorphosis. It is continuous with the ‘overlaying’ squamous epithelium, the peripodial membrane. The focus of our work is to understand how the Wnt morphogen patterns the dome-shaped wing pouch region of the wing disc. As imaginal discs are flat overall, conventional imaging has them mounted for top-down or upside-down observation, whereby cover-slips compress and distort the folded structure. The use of spacers prevents distortions, but imaging of the entire wing pouch using Z-stacks has proved unsatisfactory or impossible; as outlined above, the reduced resolution in the Z-axis typically prevents high-resolution reconstruction of the epithelium in the apical/basal direction. Therefore, only the apical half of the epithelium of the wing pouch is detected at high resolution. This problem is exacerbated if weak signals are to be detected. Thus, uniform imaging requires a ‘side-view’ that can be obtained in sections. We modified a cryosection protocol (Culbertson et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2012) to obtain transverse sections of wing discs at defined angles. This methodology was critical to our analysis of signaling gradients in the wing pouch.
Bio-protocol-2407	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2724	Measurement of Lysosomal Size and Lysosomal Marker	C. elegans, Intestine, Endocytosis, Gut granule, Confocal microscopy, Lysosome Background Caenorhabditis elegans is a multicellular organism that has been used to study endocytic trafficking. Originally, assays were developed to study endocytosis in C. elegans oocytes, embryos, and coelomocytes (scavenger cells). Briefly, the assays in oocytes and embryos were performed by measuring the intensities and sizes of compartments containing a yolk protein-green fluorescent protein reporter (VIT-2::GFP) in intestinal compartments at the comma to ‘1.5 fold’ stages of development (Grant and Hirsh, 1999; Schaheen et al., 2006a). In adults, the intensities and sizes of compartments containing GFP (secreted from body wall muscle cells into the psuedocoelom and endocytosed by coelomocytes) were measured in the coelomocytes of transgenic adult C. elegans expressing Pmyo-3::ssGFP (signal sequence-GFP fusion protein) (Treusch et al., 2004). These assays have been used to identify and to elucidate functions of mediators of the endocytic pathway (Fares and Greenwald, 2001a and 2001b; Schaheen et al., 2006b; Huynh et al., 2016).

Various tags such as Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) tag and its derivatives, tandem affinity purification tags, such as FLAG-HA or ProtA-CBP, have revolutionized the biological research over the years. Some newly developed chemical tags, such as SNAP or CLIP, allow conditional labeling of the protein of interest in a time-controlled fashion (Bodor et al., 2012). However, a method to incorporate as many different tags as possible into a gene of interest efficiently has been poorly developed.

In addition to this site of synthesis, there have been hints that also leaves of a certain developmental stage might be able to produce pyrrolizidine alkaloids (Niemüller et al., 2012). Therefore, a protocol was developed to determine the biosynthetic capability of comfrey leaves to synthesize pyrrolizidine alkaloids independently from other plant organs.

Moreover,  the  transparency  of  its  eggs  enables  precise  introduction  of DNA/RNA/Protein solutions into the cytoplasm of the eggs by microinjection. Microinjection is important for the functional genomic analysis; for example, DNA microinjection is an indispensable technique for generating transgenic fish, and helps us to understand the functions of introduced genes in vivo (Ozato et al., 1986). Furthermore, microinjection of CRISPR/Cas system is able to achieve targeted genome editings such as knockout and knock-in approaches (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014; Murakami et al., 2017a). Both of a stereoscopic microscope and an upright microscope can be used for microinjection into fish embryos. Although microinjection with an upright microscope requires attachment of some specific instruments including a micromanipulator and an injection needle holder to the microscope, this method may achieve more precise introduction of solutions into the cytoplasm than that with a stereoscopic microscope due to its high resolution property. In this paper, we described the outline of a microinjection method with an upright microscope. This method can be used together with other protocols, such as those for the generation of gene knockout or gene knock-in lines (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014; Murakami et al., 2017b).

The stoichiometry of these interactions is an important factor that regulates biochemical reactions in the cell. Experimental determination of complex stoichiometry is therefore critical to fully understand the biochemical and biophysical processes at work within cells.

Several protocols, mostly differing in the number of steps for cell isolation, yield astrocyte cultures with sufficient purity (up to 98% ). However, most protocols described to date focus on the isolation of astrocytes from the neocortex and use chemical dissociation (Schildge et al., 2013). Here, we provide an alternative method to generate highly enriched astrocyte monolayers without the necessity of chemical tissue dissociation, what makes the protocol rather faster as compared to previous methods. Additionally, we also describe the isolation and culture of neocortical and cerebellum astrocytes, highlighting some important differences between these two cell populations. Finally, we describe an alternative, cost-effective approach for gene delivery in astrocytes using nucleofection (Chouchane et al., 2017). This technique consists of the direct delivery of DNA molecules following electroporation of the cells using a specific voltage and reagent. Nucleofection of proneural genes into astrocytes is a cheap, fast and relatively efficient method that leads to similar results as compared to retroviral-mediated transfection (Heins et al., 2002; Berninger et al., 2007; Heinrich et al., 2012; Chouchane et al., 2017). It also presents a great advantage as quiescent astrocytes are easily targeted, hence bypassing the precondition of having dividing cells.
Bio-protocol-2420	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2711	Ex vivo Analysis of Lipolysis in Human Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Explants	Human adipocyte biology, Lipolysis, ex vivo, Explant Background Human white adipose tissue (WAT) plays a major role in body energy homeostasis. Adipocytes, specialized cells expressing specific lipid handling metabolic activities, constitute more than 90% of the volume of WAT (Lafontan, 2012). In addition to adipocytes, other cell types are present within human WAT e.g., vascular cells, immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages) and progenitor cells involved in WAT remodeling and renewal. The metabolic activity of adipocytes is tightly controlled by the integration of both local and systemic pathways. Neurohumoral signals modulated in anabolic or catabolic conditions impact on the net adipocyte metabolic activity, i.e., energy storage or release. In post-prandial conditions, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) originating from the hydrolysis of VLDL and chylomicron particles are taken up by the adipocytes and esterified to glycerol phosphate to form triglycerides packaged into a single lipid vacuole (Large et al., 2004). This process called lipogenesis, is mainly under the control of insulin. In conditions of energy demand such as exercise or fasting, hydrolysis of triacylglycerol through a process called lipolysis results in the release of glycerol and

Bio-protocol-2422	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2709	Quantification of Neisseria meningitidis Adherence to Human	Neisseria, Colonization, Adherence, Adhesion assay, Type IV pili Background Upon entry to a new host, adherence to specific host tissues serves as an important step in bacterial pathogenesis. Molecular interaction between bacterial adhesins and receptors on the host cell surface determines colonization sites (Soto and Hultgren, 1999). The epithelial layer in the nasopharynx forms the first cellular barrier that the human restricted pathogen N. meningitidis encounters and colonizes asymptomatically. Tight adherence and interaction with the host cells can lead to penetration of the epithelium and entry into the bloodstream, resulting in life-threatening sepsis and/or meningitis (Stephens, 2009). Long filaments extending from the bacterial membrane, called type IV pili (Tfp), containing PilC1 tip-located adhesin play a key role in initial adherence of N. meningitidis to the nasopharyngeal epithelium (Marceau et al., 1995; Rudel et al., 1995). Tfp does not only promote interaction with host cells but is also involved in the development of bacterial aggregates, that can contribute to a high level of adherence and resistance against shear stress (Helaine et al., 2005; Mikaty et al., 2009; Engman et al., 2016). Apart from the Tfp, other surface expressed molecules like the opacity proteins, LPS, NadA, NhhA, App and MspA have been shown to affect the level of adhesion to the epithelial surface (Hill et al., 2010).

It contains genetic code with instruction for proteins and other molecules necessary for structure and metabolism of an organism. DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is built of one of four types of nucleobases (cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine), deoxyribose and phosphate group. Physical and chemical changes in DNA structure are classified as DNA damages. It includes one or two strands of DNA breaks, missing nucleotide or chemical changes of nucleobases. Damages can be induced by environmental factors, like chemicals or UV light exposure, or in result of metabolic processes, which produce reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, reactive carbonyl species and alkylating agents (De Bont and van Larebeke, 2004).

Fish bile has been routinely applied as a biomarker for environmental contamination for several decades, although the focus until recently has been only the detection of environmental contaminants, and not the evaluation of possible biochemical effects, such as differential protein expression. However, the fish bile proteome has been recently validated as a tool for monitoring the impact of environmental contaminants on fish metabolism. These include the possible deleterious effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Pampanin et al., 2014), metals and metalloids (HauserDavis et al., 2012a) and complex mixtures (Hauser-Davis et al., 2012b), among other pollutants. However, this is a very recent field, and studies are still lacking in this regard. In this context, fish bile contains high amounts of lipids and bile salts, which interfere in protein quantification, 1D- and 2Delectrophoresis and mass spectrometry analyses (Hauser-Davis et al., 2012b). Thus, clean-up procedures are of the utmost importance in order to obtain reproducible results and adequately prepare this fluid for subsequent proteomic applications.

Bio-protocol-2428	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2703	Determination of Boron Content Using a Simple and Rapid Miniaturized Curcumin Assay	Boron, Curcumin method, Protoplasts, Arabidopsis, Yeast Background Boron (B) can be quantified using spectrometric and colorimetric methods. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is the most sensitive method currently available having a detection limit of 0.01 m g/L (Kmiecik et al., 2016) but requires a sample volume of 5 ml. However, this technique requires sophisticated and expensive equipment which is not affordable for smaller laboratories. Alternatively, colorimetric based assays using curcumin or Azomethine-H dyes can be used for the routine analysis of boron in all laboratories with access to a spectrophotometer that can measure absorbance at 550~n m . Bingham (1982) reported that the curcumin assay is more efficient than the Azomethine-H based assay. Therefore, we present a modified version of simple and rapid curcumin assay to quantify B based on a protocol originally published by Wimmer and Goldbach (1999). We have used this protocol to determine the intracellular boron in yeast cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Additionally, this protocol can be used to study the uptake, root to shoot translocation-mechanisms of Boron in plants.

Bio-protocol-2432	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2699	Obtaining Acute Brain Slices	Acute brain slices, Hippocampus, Dissection, Brain extraction, Electrophysiology, Mouse Background With the democratization of in vitro electrophysiology and amperometry recording techniques, obtaining acute slices from rodent brains has become a classic and pivotal procedure in neuroscience research. Yet, the know-how required to achieving this procedure is typically passed on verbally, and most labs have developed home-made recipes and adapted the most important steps to their own needs or region of interest, such that there is a lack of protocols describing how to obtain high-quality acute brain slices in a step by step manner. While some protocols can be found describing particularly challenging preparations, such as acute slicing of adult mouse spinal cord (Garre et al., Bioprotocol 2017: https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2102), a description of the basic procedure for more routine preparations (e.g., hippocampal slices) is particularly lacking. Aside from the practical aspect, this is a major problem because extracellular field recordings from hippocampal slice have become widely employed, due to their relative simplicity and little equipment-requirement, including by labs without electrophysiology and acute brain slices preparation expertise. Given that the slices’ quality is the limiting factor to obtaining reliable electrophysiological recordings, this poses a major challenge for the reproducibility of results within and across labs. In light of these needs and caveats, we here provide a detailed protocol for the dissection, brain extraction and acute slicing of the mouse hippocampus, including tips and list of material required. It will allow beginner and non-experts to obtain acute hippocampal brain slices of the required quality for follow-up studies such as field recordings, patch-clamp recordings or amperometric recordings (Papouin et al., 2017).

Initial  attachment  to  the  nasopharyngeal  epithelium  and  subsequent  formation  of microcolonies are the first steps in the establishment of infection. In order to cause a disease N. meningitidis must cross the epithelial barrier in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, its natural reservoir, and enter the bloodstream (Stephens, 2009; Trivedi et al., 2011). Dispersal of bacteria from microcolonies plays an important role in progression to an invasive disease as it allows the bacteria to come in close contact with the host epithelium (Pujol et al., 1997 and 1999). Despite its importance, not much is known about the underlying mechanism that governs neisserial detachment from the microcolonies. Recently, we reported that lactate, a common metabolite produced and released from human host cells, is involved in inducing microcolony dispersal (Sigurlásdóttir et al., 2017). Here, we provide a step by step method adapted from Sigurlásdóttir et al. (2017) that can be used to examine the effect of small molecules on N. meningitidis microcolony dispersal in a host-cell free manner by time-lapse imaging. In the described method the focus is to examine microcolony dispersal after addition of lactate, however the effect of other molecules derived from the host or the microbiota can also be tested.

Here we created transgenic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lines that express the tetraspanin CD63 exosomal marker fused with Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) to trace and quantify exosome transfer to Human Umbilical Cord Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technology. This simple method requires an optical microscope, a light source, and a fluorescent probe. As a first step, a background image of the HUVEC is saved before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused on the HUVEC, and the RFP fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination, which causes their fluorescence lifetime to decrease quickly. Using this approach, red fluorescence recovery would be due to exosome uptake by the photobleached HUVEC. We used this system to examine the exosomal transfer of HIF-MSC to HUVEC as a potential therapeutic approach for angiogenesis.

The only current treatment for end-stage liver diseases is liver transplantation, but its application is limited due to donor shortages. Recently, our group proposed an approach to generate a novel type of LPC that can stably expand in vitro and can repopulate injured liver of chronic hepatitis animal models with an extensive efficiency (Katsuda et al., 2017). Using a cocktail of three small molecules Y-27632, A-83-01 and CHIR99021 (YAC), this approach allows reprogramming of terminally committed MHs into bipotent LPCs without any genetic modification. Thus, we name these cells chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs). Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol to generate CLiPs from primary rat MHs and evaluate the bipotentiality of the generated CLiPs (Figure 1).

This process requires the TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor. Auxin promotes the binding of TIR1/AFB and Aux/IAA, which leads to ubiquitination and degradation of the latter, and results in transcription of auxinresponsive genes. This protocol focuses on measuring the growth, auxin signaling and cell wall acidification in Arabidopsis thaliana etiolated hypocotyls. This protocol is based on the previous work of Schenck et al., 2010, Takahashi et al., 2012, Fraas et al., 2014 and Spartz et al., 2014; but unlike the published work, we describe the procedures that enable measuring a larger spectrum of processes occurring during growth of hypocotyls; from the macroscopically visible organ elongation, cell wall pH monitored by confocal microscopy to the real-time nuclear auxin signaling visualized by luciferase bioluminescence.

Most Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs) contain a conserved catalytic cysteine with a low dissociation constant (pKa) that is highly susceptible to oxidation by ROS (Rudyk and Eaton, 2014). ROS-inactivation of PTPs plays an important role in regulating tyrosine-kinase-mediated signaling responses in numerous cell types. PTPs are rapidly oxidized in cells treated with the ROS H_2O_2 or the PTP inhibitor pervanadate (Huyer et al., 1997; Choi et al., 2017). Iodoacetyl-polyethylene glycol-biotin (IAP-biotin) selectively and irreversibly reacts with de-protonated (S-) cysteine thiols (Rudyk and Eaton, 2014). To label basal reduced (active) cellular PTPs, IAP-biotin is added at the time of cell lysis.

Despite its importance to supporting growth and development, the pattern of vascular networks in monocot stems has been poorly studied. Visualization of stem vascular networks is quite challenging because veins are deeply embedded in tissues. Conventional tissue sectioning can be applied to observe the networks, however, it is a laborious and time-consuming process which requires observation of hundreds of sections. In addition, the size of crop stems, which is much larger than the field of view under the microscopes, makes it difficult to capture the whole system.
Bio-protocol-2450	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2681	Electron Tomography to Study the Three-dimensional Structure of Plasmodesmata in Plant Tissues–from High Pressure Freezing Preparation to Ultrathin Section Collection	Plasmodesmata, Plant, Cell wall, Electron tomography, Electron microscopy, Cryofixation Background High Pressure Freezing (HPF) relies on the vitrification of the water present in the sample. By cooling down the sample at a high enough freezing rate (10^4-10^5^°C/s e c) , its contained water molecules cannot reorganize in a crystal-fashion and remain vitrified in an amorphous state (see Dubochet 2007 for further reading on the physics behind water crystallization). The sample is then said to be ‘cryoimmobilized’ or ‘vitrified’. This is generally achieved by the use of liquid nitrogen (-195^°C) or liquid ethane (-188^°C) . At ambient pressure, this phenomenon can only be achieved on a few microns ( <5 microns), however by raising the pressure to approximately 2,000 bars (2,000 atmospheres), this depth can reach at least 200 microns (up to 500 microns in certain conditions). This allows the vitrification of thick biological tissues without any osmotic artefacts.

In laboratory conditions, when presented with an  O_2 gradient, C. elegans migrate towards intermediate concentrations (2%-12%) (Gray et al., 2004). Low levels of O_2 may indicate the presence of bacteria (food) while high O_2 levels may imply that the worms are close to the surface of its environmental substrate. Therefore, C. elegans responds in an exquisitely sensitive manner to changes in  O_2 concentration to enable navigation to optimal environments conducive to survival and propagation of offspring (Gray et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2006; Zimmer et al., 2009). Similarly, worms present a strong behavioral response to changes in C O_2 . Well-fed animals avoid C O_2 while starved animals are attracted to C O_2 (Hallem and Sternberg, 2008). This change in response may provide an evolutionary advantage to find food, as the bacterial food source releases C O_2 . Furthermore, pathogens generate C O_2 , which possibly indicates why well-fed worms avoid C O_2 . Specific neurons regulate gas sensing responses in C. elegans including the head neurons URXL/R, BAGL/R, AQR and the PQR neuron located in the tail (Hallem and Sternberg, 2008; Zimmer et al., 2009; Bretscher et al., 2011). The main regulators of  O_2 sensing are the URX and BAG neurons, which sense upshifts and downshifts of oxygen respectively. Regarding changes in C O_2 levels, the BAG neurons are the principal sensors.

Phage p2 is a model for the most prevalent group (Sk1virus) of virulent lactococcal phages found in the dairy industry (Deveau et al., 2006; Mahony et al., 2012) and it infects the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis MG1363, also a model strain for basic research. Despite the status of p2 as a reference phage, almost half of its genes encode uncharacterized proteins. Likewise, a clear majority of phage genes identified by metagenomics have no functional assignment and no homolog in public databases (Hurwitz et al., 2016; Paez-Espino et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2460	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2671	Mechanical Allodynia Assessment in a Murine Neuropathic Pain Model	Pain, Nociception, Neuropathic pain, Analgesia, Mice Background The chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain was first developed by Bennett and Xie (1988). The chronic constriction is applied to the sciatic nerve mimicking a posttraumatic painful peripheral neuropathy. This model induces a partial denervation and, therefore, is very useful for a quantitative analysis of pain behaviours and for the evaluation of analgesic effect of novel drugs. The CCI of the sciatic nerve is carried out under isoflurane anesthesia ( 5% for induction and 2% for maintenance). The biceps femoris and the gluteus superficialis are separated by dissection to expose the sciatic nerve. The CCI is induced by loosely tying one ligature around the sciatic nerve, to preserve epineural circulation.
Bio-protocol-2461	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2670	Determining Ribosome Translational Status by Ribo-ELISA	Ribosome, ELISA, Ribopuromycylation Background Ribosomes are heterogeneous structures consisting of 40S and 60S subunits that are present in cells as monosomes and polysomes, when multiple ribosomes are bound to a single mRNA. Additionally, translating ribosomes can be associated with multiple molecular complexes that modulate translation. The ribosome ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) enables detection of translating ribosomes by in vitro puromycylation of ribosome associated nascent chains (David et al., 2012). This chemical reaction proceeds spontaneously upon adding puromycin to ribosomes with bound nascent chains. This method quantitates the number of nascent chains present per ribosome and can be used to determine the translational status of monosomes relative to polysomes, and identify ribosomes bound to other macromolecules that alter its sedimentation rate or migration in sizing columns.

Though this method has proven to be remarkably accurate for evaluating translation rates, it provides no information on the location of translating ribosomes. More recently, amino acids analogs have enabled fluorescent detection nascent chains (Dieterich et al., 2007). Nevertheless, nearly all of the detected signal comes from polypeptides released from ribosome. Our initial idea was to develop a method to label nascent chains while still tethered to translating ribosomes.

Bio-protocol-2466	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2665	Genotyping-free Selection of Double Allelic Gene Edited Medaka Using Two Different Fluorescent Proteins	Medaka, Genome editing, Gene knock-in, CRISPR/Cas, Fluorescent reporter gene Background Because the conventional genotyping of genome edited animals largely depends on PCR-based genotyping, it is necessary to extract genomic DNA. In medaka, tail fin is an accessible and regenerable tissue, so that it is frequently used for genotyping to keep fish alive. To cut tail fin, fish must be fed for a few weeks to grow big enough (ca. 1 cm in body length). Feeding and taking care of many fishes are time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, reducing the number of fish to be fed in the early stage of breeding, such as embryos and early larvae, is desired to reduce the tasks. However, it is hard to take tail fin from embryos and early larvae alive because they are too small and fragile. To overcome this issue, a simple and non-invasive method for genotyping is essential. Therefore, we developed a new method that can non-invasively determine the genotype of each individual at embryonic stage simply by observing the fluorescence. We demonstrated the benefit of this method in a gene knock-in experiment targeting the growth associated protein 43 (gap43) gene expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) (Murakami et al., 2017). This gene is suitable for the gene knock-in experiment, because its spatio-temporal expression pattern has been already revealed by RTPCR and in situ hybridization in a previous study (Fujimori et al., 2008). If the expression pattern of a targeted gene in wild-type is unknown, it needs to be analyzed by RT-PCR, or any other technique, in order to confirm the correspondence between it and that of reporter gene in gene knock-in strains.
Bio-protocol-2467	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2664	Preparation, Stimulation and Other Uses of Adult Rat Brain Synaptosomes	GAD65, Synaptic Vesicle (SV), GABA, Synaptosomes Background Synaptosomal preparation methods were established in neuroscience research laboratories over 40 years ago and have been of great value in scientific innovations relating to neurotransmitter release with respect to elevated extracellular potassium as well as responses to increased intracellular calcium. In addition to elucidating the process of neurotransmitter release, synaptosomal preparations have been a valuable source of synaptic vesicles. Studies on synaptic vesicles have for example been used in the characterization of protein components that participate in coupled neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicular release. Synaptosomal preparations have also been very valuable as an intermediate in isolation of synaptic vesicles which are then analyzed in terms of protein complexes located on the vesicular membrane that include neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes. Of key significance in this regard is the vesicular membrane GAD65 complex which includes CSP (Cystine-String Protein), VGAT (Vesicular GABA transporters) and CaMKII (calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase II). Regulation of GAD65 activity has been further characterized in terms of GAD65 cleavage by calpain and activation of membrane bound GAD through phosphorylation as well as accelerated anchoring of GAD65 to SV by palmitoylation.

Bio-protocol-2469	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2662	Biomechanical Characterization of Onion Epidermal Cell Walls	Cell walls, Mechanics, Elastic modulus, Plastic modulus, Creep, Onion epidermis Background The primary walls of growing plant cells are strong enough to resist the tensile forces generated by cell turgor pressure, yet can expand irreversibly during cell growth as a result of the selective loosening action of expansins or other catalysts necessary for irreversible cell wall enlargement (Cosgrove, 2016a and 2016b). Assessments of cell wall mechanical properties, such as elasticity and plasticity, are important for understanding cell wall structure and its modification during growth (cell enlargement) and after growth ceases. An important measure of wall mechanics is based on uniaxial tensile tests, as described below in our stress/strain assay, which measures elastic and plastic compliance (compliance is the reciprocal of modulus; modulus is a measure of stiffness). A second, complementary assay is based on the irreversible, time-dependent increase in length (creep) that occurs in primary cell walls when they are held at constant tension and continuously loosened by endogenous expansin or exogenous endoglucanase (Durachko and Cosgrove, 2009; Cosgrove, 2011; Cosgrove et al., 2017). In this protocol, we describe procedures for preparing epidermal cell wall strips from onion scales and testing them in these two assays. Onion epidermal cell walls provide a useful model to explore the connection between cell wall structure and biomechanics (Wilson et al., 2000; Suslov et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2472	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2659	FACS-based Isolation of Neural and Glioma Stem Cell Populations from Fresh Human Tissues Utilizing EGF Ligand	EGF, EGFR, FACS, Stem cells, Neural, Glioblastoma, Germinal matrix, Human Background Understanding the intrinsic biology of human neural and glioma stem cells has been challenging, due to the lack of universal neural and glioma stem cell markers (Lathia et al., 2015) and the frequent reliance on cultured cells rather than those isolated directly from the tissue. The transmembrane glycoprotein Prominin, or CD133, is one of the best described and frequently used stem cell markers for the isolation of neural (Uchida et al., 2000) and glioma stem cells (GSC) (Singh et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2004; Lathia et al., 2015), with its utility being demonstrated in both acutely sorted human tissues and neurospheres. However, some recent studies have pointed out that CD133-negative cells isolated from human glioblastoma (GBM) also harbor stem cell properties (Beier et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Tome-Garcia et al., 2017). Other cell surface markers used to isolate GSC include CD44 (Anido et al., 2010), CD15 (Son et al., 2009), A2B5 (Ogden et al., 2008), integrin alpha (Lathia et al., 2010) or EGFR (Mazzoleni et al., 2010), but these antibody-based methodologies have also lacked the ability to capture all sphere-forming populations or their use has been limited to cultured cells.
Bio-protocol-2473	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2658	Quantifying the Capacity of Phloem Loading in Leaf Disks with 14CSucrose	Arabidopsis, Phloem loading, Phloem transport, 14CSuc uptake, Leaf disks Background Transport of photoassimilates from source to sink organs is essential for normal growth and maintenance of whole plants. Phloem loading in leaves is the delivery of photoassimilate synthesized in mesophyll cells to the companion cells (CC) and sieve elements (SE) of the phloem vasculature system. Three distinct loading mechanisms are recognized. Two of these expend energy to accumulate high concentrations of sugar in the CC and SEs and generate a high hydrostatic pressure in source-leaf phloem. The first is apoplastic phloem loading, in which Suc (and/or sugar alcohols in some species) is loaded across the plasma membrane from the cell wall space (i.e., the apoplast) into the CCs at the expense of the proton motive force (Giaquinta, 1983). The second is polymer trapping, in which Suc diffuses into the phloem through specialized plasmodesmata and is converted to oligosaccharides that are too large to diffuse back out (Turgeon, 1996). The third mechanism is passive loading, in which the highest solute concentrations are in the mesophyll cells and plasmodesmata provide an open path for passive movement into the CCs and SEs (Rennie and Turgeon, 2009).

The  H^+ -ATPase generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, and provides the energy required for numerous secondary transports in plant cells. However, it is not easy to measure the activity of H^+ -ATPase in vivo. Taking advantage of the blue light-sensitive properties of guard cells, our method makes it possible to measure H^+ -pumping as an in vivo H^+ -ATPase activity using Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts (Ueno et al., 2005). Together with H^+ -ATPase quantification by Western blot (Yamauchi et al., 2016), this method allows comparing H^+ -ATPase activity under different conditions or mutant backgrounds.
Bio-protocol-2479	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2652	Ex vivo Trophoblast-specific Genetic Manipulation Using Lentiviral Delivery	Blastocyst, Placenta, Trophoblast, Lentiviral vector Background The placenta functions as a conduit between the mother and the developing fetus and is essential for viviparity (Georgiades et al., 2002). It is specialized to facilitate and coordinate maternal adaptations to pregnancy and fetal development (Soares et al., 2014; Burton et al., 2016). The placenta contains trophoblast cells, which perform several specialized functions. Acquisition of trophoblast cell specializations requires highly regulated differentiation of trophoblast stem and progenitor cell populations (Maltepe and Fisher, 2015). The mature rat placenta is comprised of two morphologically and functionally distinct compartments: the junctional zone and the labyrinth zone (Soares et al., 2012). Progenitor cells, spongiotrophoblast cells, glycogen trophoblast cells, and polyploid trophoblast giant cells comprise the junctional zone. An invasive trophoblast lineage arises from progenitors within the junctional zone region (Ain et al., 2003; Soares et al., 2014). During the last week of gestation, these cells move out of the placenta and invade into the maternal uterine mesometrial compartment (Ain et al., 2003; Pijnenborg and Vercruysse, 2010). The innermost layer of the placenta (proximal to the developing fetus) is called the labyrinth zone, which consists of trophoblast cells and fetal vasculature derived from the allantois. Progenitor trophoblast cells within the labyrinth zone fuse to form syncytia, which provide barriers between maternal and fetal compartments (Soares et al., 2012). The labyrinth zone consists of an elaborate branched structure, providing a large surface area for nutrient, waste and gas exchange with the fetus (Knipp et al., 1999; Watson and Cross, 2005).

Bio-protocol-2481	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2650	Generation of Busulfan Chimeric Mice for the Analysis of T Cell Population Dynamics	T cells, T cell homeostasis, Bone marrow chimeras, Busulfan, Temporal fate mapping Background Bone marrow chimeras are a valuable tool for studying immune system development and function. Typically, chimeras are generated by irradiation of host mice followed by transplantation with donor bone marrow. Irradiation causes considerable damage to the haematopoietic system, and full immune reconstitution is delayed by weeks to months post-transplant (Fry and Mackall, 2005). The resulting period of lymphopenia drives spontaneous proliferation of naïve T cells and the acquisition of a memory-like phenotype (Goldrath et al., 2004). To avoid the perturbation of immune homeostasis caused by irradiation, we turned our attention to the conditioning drug busulfan. Busulfan is an alkylating agent that is toxic to haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) but does not deplete circulating lymphocytes (Westerhof et al., 2000; Hsieh et al., 2007). Following busulfan conditioning and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), chimeras are indistinguishable from untreated controls: they have normal numbers of naïve and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, and these cells express normal levels of the proliferation marker Ki67 (Hogan et al., 2015; Gossel et al., 2017). Therefore, busulfan conditioning allows induction of chimerism while preserving peripheral immune homeostasis. By using donor bone marrow bearing a congenic marker, it is possible to distinguish host- or donor-origin cells by flow cytometry. While HSC replacement is never absolute, emergence of donor origin cells can be used as an accurate proxy for de novo haematopoetic development since BMT, thereby allowing cells within a population to be stratified by age on the basis of congenic marker expression.
Bio-protocol-2482	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2649	Analysing Temporal Dynamics of T Cell Division in vivo Using Ki67 and BrdU Co-labelling by Flow Cytometry	T cells, Ki67, BrdU labelling, T cell proliferation, DNA labelling, Flow cytometry Background Quantifying the dynamics of T cell death and division is a significant experimental and computational challenge, yet this information is vital to our understanding of how a healthy immune system develops and is maintained. A variety of techniques exist for in vivo analysis of T cell population dynamics, but the interpretation of data is complicated and results can be model-dependent (Asquith et al., 2002; De Boer and Perelson, 2013). Many of these assays are based on flow cytometric readouts, providing an opportunity to gain novel insights by exploiting the potential for multiparametric analysis. Combining analysis of BrdU uptake alongside Ki67 expression is particularly useful as each represents a distinct parameter of cell division. BrdU is a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, and thus permanently marks cells that have divided during the labelling period (Tough and Sprent, 1994; Bonhoeffer et al., 2000). In contrast, Ki67 is a transient marker of cell division: the Ki67 protein is expressed during cell cycle and for a short duration (3-4 days) thereafter (De Boer and Perelson, 2013; Gossel et al., 2017). Measuring Ki67 expression simultaneously with BrdU uptake therefore provides both recent and historical proliferation information from the same cell.

Macroautophagy (or simply autophagy) is initiated by the formation of the phagophore, a membrane able to expand itself engulfing organelles and proteins that finally closes around sequestered components forming an organelle known as autophagosome. Next,  during  the  maturation  process,  the  autophagosome can  fuse with  lysosomes  to  form autolysosomes where trapped materials are degraded and recycled back by pumps located in the lysosomal limiting membrane (Glick et al., 2010).

Integrin activation and binding to the ECM triggers the recruitment of a vast array of signalling, scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins to the integrin cytoplasmic tails. Together, these adhesion constituents represent a complex and highly dynamic machinery responsible for regulating many important cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. In line with significant roles in maintaining normal physiological functions, dysregulated integrin-mediated adhesion and signalling is a forerunner in the pathogenesis of many human ailments, including bleeding disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer (Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999; Bökel and Brown, 2002; Huveneers and Danen, 2009; Legate et al., 2009; Bouvard et al., 2013; Calderwood et al., 2013; Horton et al., 2015; Seguin et al., 2015). Therefore, investigation of integrin-dependent cell-ECM adhesions is an intensely studied research topic and of broad interest to many biological fields.

This is supported by the fact that thylakoid membranes are heterogeneous during leaf maturation and during the transition from the vegetative to the flowering growth phase. There is a certain time lag associated with morphological alteration (Nozue et al., 2017). Rearrangement of thylakoid membranes occurs in parallel with changes in the shapes of chloroplasts, which go from having a typically elongated lenticular appearance to a swollen appearance that is identifiable by light microscopy.
Bio-protocol-2493	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2638	Quantification of Bacterial Polyhydroxybutyrate Content by Flow Cytometry	Polyhydroxybutyrate, PHB, Bacteria, Flow cytometry, Nile red Background Upon nutrient exhaustion and in the presence of an available carbon source, several bacterial species (e.g., Cupriavidus necator, Sinorhizobium meliloti, species of Pseudomonas) switch on the accumulation of the neutral polymer of  -hydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), for storage of carbon and reducing power (Jendrossek and Pfeiffer, 2014). Classical methods for quantification of bacterial PHB content are based on its initial depolymerization, followed by the quantitative detection of specific chemical derivatives of  -hydroxybutyrate by UV spectrophotometry or gas chromatography (Law and Slepecky, 1961; Braunegg et al., 1978). More recently, the application of the fluorochrome Nile red  (9-diethylamino-5H-benzoαphenoxazine-5-one)  (Greenspan  and  Fowler,  1985)  to  stain intracellular PHB granules (Müller et al., 1993) led to the development of novel rapid fluorometric methods to quantify the content of the polymer in bacterial samples. Subsequently, coupling of Nile red– based PHB staining to flow cytometry made possible the quantification of the polymer content at a single-cell level within bacterial populations (Gorenflo et al., 1999; Kacmar et al., 2006; Tyo et al., 2006; Alves et al., 2017; Lagares Jr. et al., 2017). We report here a detailed protocol that summarizes the consensus steps for the quantification of PHB in bacterial cells by Nile red staining coupled to flow cytometry.

APP endocytosis is required for A42 generation (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Grbovic et al., 2003; Cirrito et al., 2008; Rajendran et al., 2008). Upon endocytosis, APP can recycle back to the plasma membrane likely escaping processing at endosomes. While many studies have characterized APP endocytosis, mechanisms that regulate APP recycling need to be established. A robust, sensitive and quantitative assay is thus necessary. APP recycling has been assessed qualitatively by immunofluorescence and quantitatively using bulk biotinylation of surface proteins followed by a chase for endocytosis and a chase for recycling after stripping or blocking of surface proteins (Koo et al., 1996; Yamazaki et al., 1996; Chaufty et al., 2012).

Bio-protocol-2500	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2631	Live Imaging of Axonal Transport in the Motor Neurons of Drosophila Larvae	Axonal transport, Live imaging, Drosophila, Inverted fluorescence microscopy Background Axons are a unique neuronal structure, by which neurons transmit electric and chemical signals to neighboring neurons, muscles and other tissues. Axonal function is maintained by the circular flow or shuttling of vesicles, organelles and materials (Liu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2012; Alami et al., 2014). Axonal dysfunction is thought to be an early sign of neurodegeneration and a cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neuron diseases in humans (Hirokawa et al., 2010; Millecamps and Julien, 2013). However, it is difficult to monitor the process of axonal degeneration in these neurodegenerative diseases in both humans and mammalian models. The Drosophila model is a powerful tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular-genetic level and has provided important evidence for therapeutic approaches through the live imaging of neurons in vivo (Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2014; Hosaka et al., 2017). Upright fluorescence microscopy techniques are generally used to analyze the live imaging of tissues and organ cultures. However, inverted fluorescence microscopy has seen an increase in demand due to its broad utility and extensibility. Here, we introduce our protocol to analyze the axonal transport of motor neurons in the third-instar larvae of Drosophila using inverted fluorescence microscopy.

Bio-protocol-2503	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2628	Formalin Murine Model of Pain	Pain, Nociception, Inflammation, Analgesia, Mice Background The formalin test is an experimental assay that permits determining mice nocifensive behaviour. Thus, the mice response (i.e., licking and flinching) is assessed after a subcutaneous injection of formalin normally in the plantar hind paw (Tjolsen et al., 1992). The test was originally described in the late seventies (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977), and, initially, it consisted of the injection of 50~ul of 5% formalin in the dorsal surface of one forepaw of a rat or a cat. Since then, the formalin test has been extensively used to assess nociception and inflammation-related responses, thus being adapted according to each study’s aim. Mice and rats are frequently used due to their innate grooming behaviour (i.e., forepaw licking). Accordingly, a 2.5% formalin (in physiological saline solution) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the rodent hind paw is commonly used to induce nociceptive responses (i.e., paw ‘flinching’ and licking) lasting for 45-90 min (Tjolsen et al., 1992).

Wild-type MLL enhances and maintains the expression of a subset of genes, including homeobox (H o x) genes, to stimulate the expansion of immature progenitors (Jude et al., 2007). The expression of Hoxa9 and Meis1 is highest in the immature progenitor/stem cell fraction, but gradually declines as cells differentiate, and eventually diminishes in terminally-differentiated cell fractions (Somervaille and Cleary, 2006; Yokoyama et al., 2013). The MLL fusion protein constitutively up-regulates the expression of target genes, including Hoxa9 and Meis1, to immortalize immature progenitor cells and cause leukemia in vivo (Ayton and Cleary, 2003; Lavau et al., 1997). To date, more than 130 different MLL-rearrangements have been identified (Meyer et al., 2017). Two-thirds of MLL-rearranged leukemia cases are caused by fusion with a gene that is part of the AF4 family-ENL family-P-TEFb (AEP) complex (Yokoyama et al., 2010). The MLL fusion proteins constitutively form an MLL/AEP hybrid complex on the target chromatin (Okuda et al., 2014; Yokoyama et al., 2010), which further associates with the SL1 complex to activate RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (Okuda et al., 2015 and 2016). AEP-mediated transactivation of MLL target genes transformed myeloid progenitors ex vivo, but did not cause leukemia in vivo, which suggested that other function is additionally required for in vivo leukemogenesis (Okuda et al., 2017). Recently, we showed that the ability to recruit the DOT1L complex is necessary to cause leukemia in vivo in addition to the ability to recruit AEP using in vivo leukemogenesis model. Thus, the combinatorial use of the in vivo leukemogenesis model and myeloid progenitor transformation assay is necessary to dissect the functional properties of oncogenes. In this protocol, we describe the in vivo leukemogenesis model using retroviral transduction in detail.
Bio-protocol-2505	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2626	Myeloid Progenitor Transformation Assay	Mixed lineage leukemia, Transformation, Myeloid, Progenitor, MLL fusion Background Chromosomal translocation generates a variety of MLL fusion genes that cause leukemia (Meyer et al., 2017). The wild-type mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein functions as a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of a set of genes including homeobox (H o x) genes in hematopoietic immature progenitor cells (Jude et al., 2007). During normal hematopoiesis, Hox genes are expressed in the stem/progenitor cell fractions, but are transcriptionally down-regulated throughout differentiation (Somervaille and Cleary, 2006; Yokoyama et al., 2013); however, the MLL fusion protein constitutively up-regulates its target genes and blocks differentiation to establish an immortalized state under ex vivo culture conditions. Recently, we reported that the MLL-ENL and MLL-AF10 fusion proteins recruit AF4 to activate transcription and also recruit the DOT1L complex to maintain the transcription of the same target genes to efficiently transform hematopoietic progenitors (Okuda et al., 2017). To investigate the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis, one can perform a myeloid progenitor transformation assay. By this assay, one can identify essential functional domains of an oncoprotein relatively easily at low cost compared to an in vivo leukemogenesis assay. In this assay, the leukemic oncogene is transduced by a retrovirus into primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow and the transduced cells are cultured in semi-solid medium containing cytokines for the myeloid lineage (Lavau et al., 1997). Cells fully transformed by an oncogene can often be established as a cell line and cultured indefinitely ex vivo. Therefore, one can perform gene knockdown experiments of these immortalized cells by transducing an sh-RNA-carrying lentivirus. Alternatively, one can immortalize progenitors derived from a genetically engineered mouse carrying conditional knockout alleles with loxP sites, and knockout the gene of interest by activating Cre-recombinase. We have shown that the MLL fusion protein associates with various co-factors to form a functional complex. MENIN and lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) are essential co-factors for leukemogenic activity (Yokoyama et al., 2005; Yokoyama and Cleary, 2008; Okuda et al., 2014). AF4 and ENL family proteins are the most frequent MLL-fusion partners, accounting for two-thirds of MLL-rearranged leukemia incidence (Huret et al., 2001), and form a biochemically stable complex with the SL1 complex and the P-TEFb elongation factor to activate transcription initiation and elongation (Yokoyama et al., 2010; Okuda et al., 2015; Okuda et al., 2016). MLL fusion proteins appear to activate transcription through the association with these cofactors in immortalized cells. In these previous studies, we used an sh-RNAmediated knockdown strategy and Cre-mediated knockout strategy with MLL fusion-immortalized cells to demonstrate the importance of cofactors in leukemic transformation. Because this method allows us to generate cell lines immortalized with different oncogenes in a short period of time, the efficacy of drugs can be analyzed on various cell lines that are dependent on different oncogenes (Grembecka et al., 2012). Thus, this assay is a powerful tool for functional analysis of leukemic oncogenes and testing of drug efficacies.

PCC6803 Using ICP-MS	Cyanobacteria, Synechocystis, Manganese, Periplasm, ICP-MS Background Mn plays a vital role in the active sites of several enzymes such as the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. In contrast to its role as an important micronutrient, Mn can be toxic when present in excess. It is therefore of crucial importance for cyanobacteria to maintain the intracellular levels of Mn and in particular to avoid free Mn in the cytoplasm. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis addresses this challenge by storing about 80% of the Mn in the periplasm. Only 20% of the cellular content can be detected in the cytoplasm and thylakoid system (Keren et al., 2002), with most of the Mn being incorporated into proteins, leaving virtually no free Mn in the cytoplasm. We recently identified the manganese transport protein Mnx, which resides in the thylakoid membrane and facilitates export of Mn from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen in Synechocystis. According to our study, Mnx is a major player in maintaining the cellular Mn homeostasis (Brandenburg et al., 2017). To analyze the biological significance of Mnx, we developed a protocol to measure the periplasmic and intracellular Mn pools separately. We chose ICP-MS for quantification, since it is a sensitive and reliable method to detect metals in biological samples. Detection limits can be in the range of n g L^-1 and below. Prior to the analysis, all complex molecules of the sample are broken down to atomic compounds by digestion with nitric acid. Subsequently, the sample is ionized by an inductively coupled plasma and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In this protocol, we describe the detailed workflow for subcellular Mn quantification, from sampling to the calculation of Mn concentrations.
Bio-protocol-2509	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2622	Brief Protocol for EDGE Bioinformatics: Analyzing Microbial and Metagenomic NGS Data	Genomics, Bioinformatics, Next-generation sequencing, Metagenomics Background EDGE bioinformatics was developed to help biologists rapidly process next-generation sequencing (NGS) data even if they have little to no bioinformatics expertise. EDGE is a highly integrated and interactive web-based platform that is capable of running many of the standard analyses that biologists require for viral, bacterial/archaeal, and metagenomic samples. EDGE provides an intuitive web-based interface for user input, allows users to visualize and interact with selected results, and generates a final detailed PDF report. Results in the form of tables, text files, graphic files, and PDFs, together with the raw output files of executed programs, can all be downloaded. A user management system allows tracking of an individual’s EDGE runs, along with the ability to share, post publicly, delete, or archive their results. Users can explore ongoing data processing within a userfriendly, intuitive web-based environment and interactive results are presented on a sample-by-sample basis. While EDGE was intentionally designed to be as simple as possible for the user, there is still no single ‘tool’ or algorithm that fits all use cases in the bioinformatics field. Our intent is to provide a detailed panoramic view of the user’s sample from various analytical standpoints. The initial release of EDGE in January 2017 provides six analytical workflows: pre-processing (data QC and host removal), assembly and annotation, reference-based analysis, taxonomy classification, phylogenetic analysis, and PCR analysis (validation and design). The latest release (version 1.5) includes several new features: identification of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, 16S/18S/fungal ITS analysis using QIIME, metadata  collection/storage,  and  comparative  analysis  of  taxonomic  classification  of  multiple metagenomic samples. EDGE Bioinformatics is an ongoing effort to provide best of breed bioinformatics tools for NGS data analysis. Updates to current modules are continuous and more modules are under development.
Bio-protocol-2510	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2621	RNA Extraction from Wistar Rat Cochlea for qRT-PCR	Cochlea/metabolism, RNA/chemistry, Real-time polymerase chain reaction Background Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in damage to hair cells is important to preserve hearing. qRT-PCR from mRNA is used in the study of metabolic pathways and possible therapeutic targets. Otological studies typically use small rodents, although the isolation of sensory cell samples with well-preserved RNA for transcriptional analysis is a significant challenge. Studies conducted with these animals have presented efficient methods for extracting RNA in the neonatal cochlea, however, adult cochlea presents limitations, due to the recovery of small amounts of mRNA. To evaluate the quality of the obtained RNA, ultraviolet absorbance and agarose gel electrophoresis can be performed. Herein, we describe a method to obtain mRNA from adult Wistar rats that can be subsequently used in qRT-PCR assays.
Bio-protocol-2511	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2620	MTT Assay for Cytotoxicity Assessment in Oryza sativa Root Tissue	Cell viability, Cytotoxicity, MTT assay, Plant tissue, Rice seedling Background This protocol is designed to determine plant cell viability directly from root tissue. Till date, MTT assay has been profusely used for mammalian cell proliferation and viability assay. In case of plants usually the 2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide (XTT) assay (Kaundal et al., 2012) is preferably used. Cost effective MTT assay can also be used for plant tissue viability assay instead of XTT assay. This protocol can be used to determine the cytotoxicity of different stress inducing agents and their lC_50 doses (the concentration of phytotoxic agent at which 50% cell  death  is  obtained).  Nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide  phosphate (N A D(P)H) dependent dehydrogenase enzyme present in mitochondrion of living cell is capable of reducing tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthia zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to an insoluble purple coloured formazan, which is measured spectrophotometrically. This reduction takes place when the mitochondrial enzymes are active and hence the degree of reduction can be directly correlated with the number of viable cells. The metabolically inactive cells will not show this property.

Bio-protocol-2513	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2618	Instillation of Particulate Suspensions to the Lungs	Particulates, Lung inflammation, Pulmonary aspiration, Intranasal administration Background Recently, many studies have demonstrated that particulate pollutants such as diesel exhaust particles, sand dusts and particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), are involved in chronic pulmonary inflammation leading to lung cancer or allergic asthma. Epidemiological analysis revealed that increased particulate air pollution is related to increased asthma hospitalization. In general, upon inhalation, fine particles, such as PM 2.5, are known to reach deep into the lungs. Instillation of suspensions of particulates into the lungs has been widely used for understanding pulmonary inflammation induced by deposited particulates (Morimoto et al., 2016).

Furthermore, the susceptibility of C. elegans to a wide range of human bacterial and fungal pathogens has made the worm an attractive system for studying microbial pathogenesis (Zhang and Hou, 2013; Cohen and Troemel, 2015). More recently, the discovery of the positive-sense ssRNA Orsay virus (OV) as the first natural viral pathogen of C. elegans has prompted the use of the OV-C. elegans model to define nematode antiviral defense mechanisms (Felix et al., 2011; Gammon, 2017). These studies have demonstrated a clear role for nematode antiviral RNA interference pathway components, such as Dicerrelated helicase 1 (DRH-1), in the restriction of virus replication (Ashe et al., 2013).

In the original entries, we demonstrated the near-complete destruction of specific target proteins, by using nanobodies that recognise either green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fridy et al., 2014) or the inflammasomal protein ASC (Schmidt et al., 2016) and two distinct monobodies that recognize the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (Sha et al., 2013) as target probes, in a number of human cancer cell lines (Fulcher et al., 2016 and 2017). This protocol provides details for the generation of AdPROM constructs, their expression in cells, and monitoring of target protein degradation and can be adapted for use with any nanobody and monobody, both for constitutive and inducible degradation of the POI. The focus of this protocol is not on the generation of nano/monobodies against POIs or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (to knockin GFP tags on POIs) but rather the latter steps to facilitate target protein destruction with the AdPROM system.

Bio-protocol-2524	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2607	Estimation of Silica Cell Silicification Level in Grass Leaves Using in situ Charring Method	Silicification, Silica cells, Grasses, Sorghum bicolor, Spodogram, Light microscope Background Silica deposition is central to grasses. Grasses deposit up to 10% of their dry weight as silica. The major sites of silica deposition in plants are root endodermal cells, abaxial epidermal cells of inflorescence bracts and silica cells in leaves (Kumar et al., 2017b). Almost the entire volume of silica cells is filled with solid, amorphous silica. Silica deposition in silica cells is physiologically controlled and takes place around the middle length of young leaves (Kumar et al., 2017a), which we named leaf-2 (Figure 1). Silica cell silicification is also a fast process completed within hours (Kumar and Elbaum, 2017), hence in the same leaf there are areas of high and low silicification intensity depending upon which area of leaf we are examining. To study the deposition process, we need a way to quantify the silica cell silicification level in different parts of the same leaf. In situ charring or spodogram preparation of plant material is an easy and cheap way to study silica deposition in plants. The plant material is burnt at temperatures typically above 500~^°C for 3h to overnight that oxidises all of the organic material. The ash remaining after the charring process contains silica and other minerals. The non-silicate minerals from the ash are dissolved by 1 N HCl and the remaining insoluble substance is silica. The in situ charring method can also be used to quantify the silica cell silicification level (Kumar et al., 2017a). The leaf piece is kept in between two glass slides to keep the leaf specimen flat (Figure 2), and then the specimen is burnt, ash washed with HCl (Figure 3) and subsequently with double distilled water to remove the mineral salts. The slide is then taken to a light microscope to count the number of silica cells silicified per unit length. Figure 4 shows a spodogram prepared from the middle of a young leaf. This part was analyzed to quantify silica deposition levels. Our method can be extended to quantify the silica cell silicification level in any leaf piece, but best results are obtained with young and still silicifying leaves.
Bio-protocol-2525	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2606	Rapid IFM Dissection for Visualizing Fluorescently Tagged Sarcomeric Proteins	Dissection, Drosophila, GFP, Indirect flight muscle, Sarcomere, Z-disc Background The cytoskeletal structures that enable contractility of striated muscle fibers are hundreds of cables called myofibrils. Myofibrils in turn are an array of serially arranged sarcomeres, all contracting simultaneously. The sarcomere is a perfectly symmetrical structure that contains all the elements required for contraction. At the center of the sarcomere lies the M-line, where myosin thick filaments are anchored. Flanking the sarcomere are the Z-discs, where actin thin filaments are anchored. Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders that cause progressive skeletal muscle weakness (Schröder and Schoser, 2009). There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, likely due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie muscular dystrophies (Olive et al., 2013). Drosophila melanogaster is an effective genetic model organism to study muscle biology owing to its short life span, economical maintenance, and abundant available resources (Hales et al., 2015; Wangler et al., 2015).

Analyses of archaeal genomes reveal a plethora of metabolic strategies, predict sophisticated and highly interdependent regulatory networks underlying gene expression and reveal many genes whose protein– and increasingly often stable RNA–products lack a defined function. The ability to challenge existing, and define new pathways through genetic manipulation has assisted in deconvoluting archaeal physiology and information processing systems, and has more recently opened archaeal species to synthetic- and systems-level approaches to define intra- and intercellular networks.

As to RSV, mechanical transmission usually fails or yields a low infectious rate (Ling, 1972). In particular, the transmission rate was only 6% after the injection of the RSV crude extraction from diseased plants (Okuyama and Asuyama, 1959). The midrib micro-injection method mentioned in this work promotes the RSV transmission rate to 17% . Though the incidence of RSV by mechanical transmission is still much lower than that by insect vector transmission (53%) , our method provides a convenient way for mechanical inoculation of persistent-propagative plant viruses. Moreover, based on this method, replication and gene expression of a persistent-propagative plant virus can be determined more accurately in infected plant hosts without the interference of insects, i.e., the inoculation doses and the insect proteins.

Bio-protocol-2536	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2595	Assessment of Aversion of Acute Pain Stimulus through Conditioned Place Aversion	Conditioned Place Aversion, Acute pain, Laser stimulus, Optogenetic stimulation Background Pain is a multidimensional experience that includes sensory and affective components. As such, behavioral tests that assess both the sensory and the emotional aspects of pain are critical to understanding the whole pain experience. However, the majority of available behavioral tests depends on the measurement of nociceptive stimuli and relies on withdrawal thresholds, which are reflexive responses. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex behaviors are under supraspinal control and can occur in the absence of supraspinal inputs. On the other hand, higher order pain behaviors such as conditioned place aversion (CPA) assess some of the emotional component of pain. These experiments involve having the animal choosing to avoid or escape a pain-inducing behavior and/or treatments by moving to the other chamber of the box (LaBuda and Fuchs 2000; Ding et al., 2005; van der Kam et al., 2008; McNabb et al., 2012; He et al., 2012). Lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) block the development of escape-avoidance pain behaviors (Johansen et al., 2001; LaGraize et al., 2004; Qu et al., 2011). However, those previous behavioral assays always implied an avoidance learning paradigm, and the conditioning lasts for consecutive days. These assays also require that pain stimulation be applied for prolonged periods of time during the multi-day conditioning phases, and thus most of these assays employed a persistent or chronic pain model. As a result, these assays do not assess the aversive response to an acute pain stimulus. Therefore, testing the aversion of acute pain stimulus is urgently needed to allow for the accurate and comprehensive assessment of acute pain and the screening of analgesics.

Bio-protocol-2538	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2593	In vitro NLK Kinase Assay	NLK, in vitro kinase assay, GST-fusion protein, YAP, Hippo pathway Background Drosophila nemo has been identified as a pivotal regulator of photoreceptor clusters in the developing Drosophila eyes (Choi and Benzer, 1994). It has been reported that nemo is conserved across various species. The mammalian homolog is nemo-like kinase (NLK) (Brott et al., 1998; Rocheleau et al., 1999). NLK is a member of the CMGC group (CDK, MAPK, GSK3 and CLK) and also belongs to the atypical MAPK family. NLK regulates multiple cellular mechanisms through transcription factors including TCF/LEF1, NICD, and FOXO, which are key players in diverse signaling pathways (Ishitani et al., 1999; Ishitani et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010). Moreover, recently we have identified NLK as a novel kinase for Yes-associated protein (YAP), a co-transcriptional activator in the Hippo pathway (Moon et al., 2017). This protocol describes an in vitro method to measure the nemo-like kinase activity.

The efficiency can be artificially improved by treating the cells with chemicals or electric pulses. Several protocols are available to prepare competent E. coli cells, however, they are usually long, laborious, and show inconsistency in competence. The protocol by Green and Rogers (2013) overcomes these downsides and allows the preparation of highly competent cells (10^6-10^8C F U/u DNA). While other protocols require cells to be grown at low temperature (19-22 ^°C) , this protocol involves growing cells at 37^°C . Thus, the cells grow faster and reach log phase within 4h as compared to 18-24~h~ . This protocol is highly reproducible.

Isolation and purification of primary SCs are crucial steps for studying the biology of SC. In addition, purified primary cultured SCs are important seed cells for neural tissue engineering. To date, various methods of culturing SCs have been reported based on the method of Brockes (Brockes et al., 1979). By reported methods, sciatic nerves are mostly used for SC isolation because they are large in size and can be easily obtained. However, SCs from sciatic nerves are easily contaminated with fibroblasts because the connective tissue is difficult to be cleared off. Especially the epineurium and perineurium are the main source of fibroblasts. Without special treatment, contaminating fibroblasts proliferate much faster than SCs and will soon be the predominant cells in the cultures. In the past decades, numerous purification methods have been developed for isolating SCs from the contaminating fibroblasts. The details of these purification methods included single or combination of antimitotic treatment (Wood, 1976), antibodymediated cytolysis (Brockes et al., 1979), immunoselection (Assouline et al., 1983; Vroemen and Weidner, 2003), repeated explantation (Oda et al., 1989), cold jet technique (Haastert et al., 2007), differential adhesion (Pannunzio et al., 2005) and differential detachment (Jin et al., 2008). These purification methods involve either complicated techniques with high cost or long harvested period with low cell yield. Therefore, obtaining a large number of purified SCs is still a challenging work for basic research and further clinical use. Here, we describe a method that uses spinal nerves from neonatal SD rats as a cell source to efficiently obtain highly purified SCs in a short period.

Bio-protocol-2546	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2585	Crude Preparation of Lipopolysaccharide from Helicobacter pylori	Lipopolysaccharide, Crude preparation, Silver staining, Western blot, Helicobacter pylori Background Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a large and variable complex glycolipid that makes up the outer leaflet of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria. It is typically composed of three domains: a hydrophobic domain termed lipid A (or endotoxin), which is embedded in the outer membrane; a relatively conserved non-repeating core-oligosaccharide; and a variable O-antigen, which extends from the cell to the external environment. A unique feature of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide Oantigen is the presence of fucosylated oligosaccharide structures that mimic human Lewis antigens. Large-scale extraction of highly pure LPS from Gram-negative bacteria is labor-intensive and timeconsuming. Here, in this protocol, we describe in detail the use of an easy and rapid crude preparation of LPS from the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori for visualization by silver staining and Lewis antigen expression by Western blot.

Bio-protocol-2548	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2583	Touchscreen-based Visual Discrimination and Reversal Tasks	Visual discrimination, Reversal, Touchscreen, Cognition, Mice Background Cognitive flexibility is the ability to flexibly adjust responses to a previously learned stimulus-reward association, and impairments occur in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. To further study the neural mechanisms implicated in cognitive flexibility, performance of choice and reversal tasks have been used in animal models. There are a variety of methods used to measure cognitive flexibility in rodent models, however many techniques have been difficult to compare between rodent and human studies (Brigman et al., 2010). However, using touchscreens, a similar paradigm can be used to study reversal learning across species (Bussey et al., 2012; Horner et al., 2013). Trained rodents are able to discriminate visual stimuli and then successfully reverse their choice when the contingency changes. However, cognitive performance in both rats and mice has been shown to be highly strain dependent (Graybeal et al., 2014). C57BL/6J mice are a popular strain for behavioural and genetic studies, and have been used as a standard strain against which others are compared (Izquierdo et al., 2006). Meanwhile, BALB/c mice often display poor learning and cognitive performance compared to other strains (Graybeal et al., 2014). Recently, the BALB/c strain was shown to be ‘severely impaired’ in basic training, visual discrimination and reversal learning using touchscreen chambers (Graybeal et al., 2014). Therefore, we have adapted the training protocol to promote responding in an anxious mouse strain (BALB/c), where behavioural (rather than cognitive) traits may impair performance. Our results indicated that this protocol provides comparable levels of performance in the standard C57BL/6 mouse to those previously published and significantly enhanced performance of the anxious and emotionally reactive BALB/c mouse (Turner et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2551	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2580	Monitoring Xylem Hydraulic Pressure in Woody Plants	Pressure, Tension, Water status, Xylem water potential Background Although plants can recover from critical levels of xylem embolism, <50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in conifers (Brodribb and Cochard, 2009) and <88% in angiosperms (Urli et al., 2013), the exact mechanism is still under debate. The ascent of sap is driven by the evaporative demand from the atmosphere, which generates a negative pressure (i.e., tension) in the water column and hydrogen bonds between molecules (i.e., cohesion) pull the sap through the plant via the well accepted cohesion-tension theory (Dixon, 1896; Angeles et al., 2004). However, positive xylem sap pressure can be recorded under particular conditions, for example water-saturated soil combined with very low transpiration. This mechanism has been shown to refill embolized vessels in springtime (Sperry et al., 1994) and in species that experienced freeze-thaw induced embolism (Charrier et al., 2013 and 2014). Refilling of embolized vessels has been hypothesized to occur under both positive and negative xylem sap pressures in Laurus sp or Vitis sp, for example (Salleo et al., 1996). However, the ‘refilling under tension’ mechanism is inconsistent with the cohesion-tension theory (Zwieniecki and Holbrook, 2000). Moreover, recent works suggest that refilling occurs only under positive pressure in Vitis (Charrier et al., 2016). The dynamic changes in xylem sap pressure therefore need to be explored at both the seasonal and diurnal scale while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the hydraulic architecture of the plant.
Bio-protocol-2552	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2579	Trimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (TriFC) Assay for	Long non-coding RNA, RNA-Protein interaction, TriFC, Tobacco transient expression Background Recently, a variety of types of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been identified and shown to play important roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification (St Laurent et al., 2015). So far, most of the molecular mechanisms for lncRNA-mediated functions are closely related with RNA-Protein interactions (St Laurent et al., 2015). Therefore, an experiment for RNA-Protein interaction is a key step in functional study of lncRNAs. In plants, molecular functions of lncRNAs are only beginning to be characterized, and the molecular basis of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation is still poorly understood. Though techniques for RNA visualization in plants have been well developed, visual assay for RNA-Protein interaction in plant is still poorly developed (Christensen et al., 2010). To develop the visual assay for RNA-Protein interaction in plants, we modified and combined MS2 system for RNA imaging technique with conventional BiFC system for protein-protein interaction (Schonberger et al., 2012) (Figure 1D). We generated binary Gateway vectors (pBA3130, 3132, 3134, and 3136) for transient BiFC assay (Seo et al., 2017) and got binary Gateway vectors (pBA-GW-6xMS2 and pBA-6xMS2-GW) for RNA tagging from Dr. Ulrich Z. Hammes (Schonberger et al., 2012). We tested and confirmed this TriFC assay was working well in plants with lncRNA, ELENA1, and MED19a protein (Seo et al., 2017). TriFC assay in plants will provide new insights in interaction between lncRNAs and proteins.

In olive, inflorescences emerge from lateral buds at the end of winter and flower in the spring. We have developed a protocol to better characterize the timing of inflorescence initiation in olive by imaging the meristem in the olive bud with a SEM at different times during the year. In these SEM images the meristem structure can be identified unambiguously, and the definition level of the meristem can be much higher than images of bud meristem sections presented in previous studies.

The remarkable multi-layered myelin sheath consists of elaborate structures including compact sheath, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, Cajal bands, inner and outer mesaxons, as well as the structures in the paranodal region. To elucidate the normal and abnormal structures of myelinated fibers of peripheral nerves, teased nerve fibers are required. Methods of teasing fibers have been widely applied in studies on peripheral nerves of human and rodents. In this protocol, we describe a method of teasing peripheral nerves into single fibers for further morphological studies on the axons or myelin of peripheral nerves.
Bio-protocol-2560	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2571	DQ-Red BSA Trafficking Assay in Cultured Cells to Assess Cargo Delivery to Lysosomes	DQ-BSA, Lysosome, Cargo, Endocytosis, Cell culture, HeLa Background Cells are constantly exchanging materials with their extracellular environment and in this process they internalize cargo in vesicles at the plasma membrane. This internalized cargo is delivered to the early endosomes from where it either goes back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes or enters the canonical endocytic pathway. Once destined to be degraded, the cargo moves to late endosomes and finally fuses with lysosomes where the active hydrolases digest the cargo (Jovic et al., 2010). These endocytic compartments have characteristic pH of their lumen. The early endosomes have a pH in the range of 5.9-6.8, late-endosomes have pH range of 4.9-6.0, and lysosomes are most acidic with pH ranging from 4.5-5.0 (Maxfield and Yamashiro, 1987). The acidic environment of lysosomes is necessary for the activity of hydrolases present in its lumen and degradation of cargo (Garg et al., 2011; Khatter et al., 2015a and 2015b).
Bio-protocol-2561	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2570	Scanning Electron Microscopy of Motile Male Gametes of Land Plants	Flagella, Male gamete, Scanning electron microscopy, Spermatozoid Background Motile gametes of land plants are strikingly diverse and develop through transformations that involve repositioning cellular components and the assembly of a complex locomotory apparatus (Renzaglia and Garbary, 2001). Because of constraints imposed by cell walls, elongation of the cell and flagella is around the periphery of a nearly spherical space, resulting in a coiled configuration of the mature gamete. The degree of coiling varies from just over one to as many as 10 revolutions per cell. The number of flagella per gamete is even more variable, ranging from two in bryophytes (mosses, hornworts, and liverworts) to an estimated 1,000-40,000 in Ginkgo and cycads. Following the diversification of Ginkgo and cycads, all vestiges of basal bodies and flagella were lost in the remaining seed plants that utilize pollen tubes to deliver non-motile sperm to egg cells (Southworth and Cresti, 1997). Male gametes provide a wealth of biological information, including biodiversity and cell differentiation and evolution (Garbary et al., 1993; Renzaglia et al., 1995; Renzaglia and Garbary, 2001; Renzaglia et al., 2000; Lopez-Smith and Renzaglia, 2008; Lopez and Renzaglia, 2014). Of the range of microscopic techniques utilized to characterize plant spermatozoids, SEM provides the most direct means of elucidating cell shape, and flagella number, length and arrangement. Together with TEM observations, SEM studies lead to comparative descriptions of gamete architecture, and organellar content and arrangement across plant lineages (Renzaglia et al., 2001 and 2002; Lopez-Smith and Renzaglia, 2008).
Bio-protocol-2562	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2569	Analysis of Xyloglucan Composition in Arabidopsis Leaves	Xyloglucan, Arabidopsis, Cell wall, Hemicellulose, Primary wall, MALDI-TOF Background In many flowering plants xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Sequential extraction protocols offer a way of separating distinct xyloglucan domains (Pauly et al., 1999). Some xyloglucan appears to be trapped inside cellulose microfibrils while another fraction is bound to their surface through hydrogen bonding. The rest of the xyloglucan, possibly the majority of it, occupies the space between microfibrils (Park and Cosgrove, 2015). Part of this later xyloglucan can be extracted through direct endoglucanase digestion of cell wall material. Much of the remaining xyloglucan can then be released through alkaline treatment. Studies of mutants deficient in xyloglucan exoglycosidases have shown that these enzymes, together with Xyloglucan  Endotransglycosylases/Hydrolases,  act  mostly  on  the  enzyme-accessible  fraction (Sampedro et al., 2010; Günl and Pauly, 2011; Günl et al., 2011; Sampedro et al., 2012; Sampedro et al., 2017). Digestion of Arabidopsis xyloglucan with endoglucanases that attack unsubstituted glucose residues results in a mixture of three and four-glucose subunits that can be quickly and easily analyzed through MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Lerouxel et al., 2002; Günl et al., 2010). The area of the ion peaks can be then used to quantify the abundance of the different fragment, although there is evidence of significant differences in response factors (Tuomivaara et al., 2015). This protocol incorporates some changes from our previous versions, such as the use of SDHB (Super-DHB) matrix, which reduces the noise, and the addition of NaCl during extraction to prevent the formation of potassium adducts.

Bio-protocol-2564	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2567	Large-scale Maize Seedling Infection with Exserohilum turcicum in the Greenhouse	Northern corn leaf blight, Seedling assay, High-throughput, Disease quantification Background Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is a ubiquitous foliar wilt disease that threatens maize production worldwide (Welz and Geiger, 2000). The disease is caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Exserohilum turcicum (anamorph of Setosphaeria turcica), which favors a high-humidity and cool temperature environment. Under favorable conditions, fungal infection manifests itself as large and irregularly emerging lesions that destroy the entire foliage. Therefore, this disease decreases the active leaf area and the accumulation of photosynthesized products. Up to 50% grain yield loss was reported but the reduction largely depended on environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity), phases of maize development and hybrid susceptibility (Ullstrup, 1970; Pataky et al., 1998).
Bio-protocol-2565	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2566	Quantification of Densities of Bacterial Endosymbionts of Insects by Real-time PCR	Bacteria, Endosymbionts, Insects, qPCR, Quantification, SYBR Green Background Insects often harbor bacterial symbionts of various taxa in their bodies. Such bacterial symbionts (endosymbiotic bacteria) attract great attention because of their profound effects on the host insect. Some bacteria provide essential nutrition to their hosts (Baumann et al., 1995), some confer resistance against parasites (Oliver et al., 2003; Hedges et al., 2008), and some even manipulate reproduction or sex determination of their hosts for their own benefit (Werren et al., 2008; Kageyama et al., 2012). Because most insect endosymbionts are uncultivable, quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a practical and convenient method to quantify endosymbiont titers (Simoncini et al., 2001), possibly complemented by other visualization methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Koga et al., 2009) and/or electron microscopy.

Palma and Francisco J. Corpas*	Nitric oxide, S-nitrosothiols, S-nitrosation, S-nitrosylation Background Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical which can interact with a diverse array of biomolecules including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In the case of proteins, one of the most relevant posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is the covalent attachment of an NO group to the thiol (-SH) side chain of cysteine (Cys) present in peptides or proteins. This modification generates a family of NOderived molecules called S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) which are important compounds in both animal and plant systems (Foster et al., 2003; Lindermayr and Durner, 2009; Astier et al., 2011; Broniowska and Hogg, 2012). Although this PTM is often designated as S-nitrosylation, the more appropriate term is Snitrosation. It is difficult to detect, quantify and identify protein SNOs in plant systems. While there are several techniques to detect SNOs such as chemiluminescence, the biotin switch method, mass spectrometry, fluorescence detection, and antibody detection (against S-nitrosocysteine) (Kettenhofen et al., 2007; Foster, 2012; Devarie-Baez et al., 2013; Diers et al., 2014; Barroso et al., 2016; Mioto et al., 2017) many of these techniques require tedious sample preparation procedures that are time consuming and require sophisticated, expensive equipment.
Bio-protocol-2573	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2558	Differentiation of Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells from Murine Bone Marrow and Their Co-culture with Splenic Dendritic Cells	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Dendritic cells, Co-culture Background The myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of myeloid cells comprised of precursor of macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells and myeloid cells at earlier stages of differentiation (Youn et al., 2008) accumulating in large numbers in lymphoid tissues of tumor-bearing mice as well as in mice with infectious diseases, sepsis and trauma. The main feature of these cells is their ability to suppress T cell responses in Ag-specific and/or nonspecific fashion. These cells are now considered as one of the major cell type responsible for tumor-associated immune defects; main factors implicated in MDSC-mediated immune suppression include high expression of Arg1 (Marvel and Gabrilovich, 2015). Arginase 1 (Arg1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunoregulatory enzymes catalyzing the degradation of L-arginine (L-Arg) and L-tryptophan (L-Trp), respectively, resulting in local amino acid deprivation. In addition, unlike Arg1, IDO1 is also endowed with nonenzymatic signaling activity in dendritic cells (DCs) (Mondanelli et al., 2017). In addition to their inherent immunosuppressive activity, MDSCs might amplify regulatory properties of other immune cells, particularly in tumor microenvironments. Although some mechanisms underlying MDSC-macrophage interaction have been established (Ugel et al., 2015), the cross-talk between MDSCs and DCs is still unclear (Ostrand-Rosenberg et al., 2012); to fill this gap, we have developed this protocol and we demonstrated that Arg1+ MDSCs confer to DCs an IDO1-dependent, immunosuppressive phenotype via Arg1 metabolites (i.e., polyamines such as putrescine and spermidine) (Mondanelli et al., 2017). The Arg and Trp immunoregulatory pathways are functionally integrated, this integration occurring both intra(i.e., DCs) and inter-cellularly (MDSCs and DCs) (Mondanelli et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2574	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2557	Method for Multiplexing CRISPR/Cas9 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	CRISPR/Cas9, Budding yeast, Multiplexing, Genome DNA editing, sgRNA Background The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) mechanism has evolved in prokaryotes as a primitive adaptive immune system with the capability to edit any genome with great precision (Jinek et al., 2012; Sorek et al., 2013). This biotechnology requires the use of an endonuclease (Cas9) from S. pyogenes (or othologous species), a single RNA ‘guide’ sequence, and exogenous donor DNA (if needed). In only a few years, CRISPR/Cas9 has been utilized in numerous research laboratories in both academic and industry settings to target DNA sequences within any genome (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). A variety of research areas including basic research, biofuels, agriculture, genetic disorders, and human pathogens/disease have begun harnessing this technology to address important scientific questions (Estrela and Cate, 2016; Demirci et al., 2017; Men et al., 2017). Recent work in S. cerevisiae has piloted the development of novel CRISPR-based applications including automated genomic engineering (Si et al., 2017), chromosome splitting (Sasano et al., 2016), and the use of nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) to modulate gene expression (Jensen et al., 2017). While this editing system has proved extremely useful, a number of concerns are still being actively addressed. These include off-target effects–the propensity of Cas9 to accidentally target additional genomic positions (Cho et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), the required cloning step(s) needed to generate multiple sgRNAs for Cas9 multiplexing (Ryan and Cate, 2014), and the safety and application of Cas9-based ‘gene drives’ (DiCarlo et al., 2015). Our methodology addresses some of these issues by engineering artificial Cas9 target site(s) within the yeast genome. We describe (i) the selection of the artificial sequences used to multiplex Cas9; (ii) the cloning strategies used to construct plasmids harboring the unique target sites flanking several genes including Cas9 itself; (iii) integration of these constructs into a single yeast genome in successive steps, and (iv) editing using expressed Cas9, sgRNA, and donor DNA to demonstrate proof of concept. This system allows for seamless, marker-less, multi-loci genomic editing with only a single sgRNA. We envision this method could be useful for synthetic genome construction, yeast library generation, and simultaneous manipulation of related genes within a common genetic or signaling pathway.

However, we found that cardiac myofibroblasts, which are responsible for tissue fibrosis, also have the ability to engulf apoptotic cells after MI (Nakaya et al., 2017). The discovery prompted us to compare the engulfment ability of cardiac macrophages and cardiac myofibroblasts. Herein, we provide a detailed protocol for an in vitro phagocytosis assay to evaluate the extent of phagocytic engulfment.

The composition of NeuroCultTM SM1 is based on the formulation of the B27 supplement (Brewer et al., 1993), but the former cocktail was found to improve the quality of neuronal cultures, in part by replacement of apo-transferrin with holo-transferrin (Chen et al., 2008). Furthermore, the chemical composition of NeuroCultTM SM1 was described in more detail in the original publication, allowing a better control of the experimental conditions. Neuronal cultures prepared with chemically defined culture media are characterized by the presence of a low percentage of astrocytes. The proliferation of astrocytes in cultures maintained for longer periods of time, in order to allow differentiation of neurons, is prevented by adding the chemical inhibitor of mitosis 5-Fluoro-2’- deoxyuridine.
Bio-protocol-2581	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2550	Bioluminescence Monitoring of Neuronal Activity in Freely Moving Zebrafish Larvae	GFP-aequorin-opt, Zebrafish, Bioluminescence, Coelenterazine, Escape response Background Unlike fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012), such as the GCaMP family, the bioluminescent indicator GFP-aequorin (Shimomura et al., 1962) does not require light excitation and therefore opens new avenues for monitoring neural activity in moving animals, including flies (Martin et al., 2007), mice (Rogers et al., 2007) and zebrafish larvae (Naumann et al., 2010). However, efficient use of GFP-aequorin remains challenging to achieve in zebrafish larvae, restricting its widespread use as a calcium indicator. The limitation lies in the fact that bioluminescence signals originating from a single muscle fiber are so large they constitute a major pitfall. Once absence of muscle expression is verified for a given transgenic line, bioluminescence signals emanating from neurons only are very small. To overcome these limitations, we developed a codon-optimized variant of GFP-aequorin for zebrafish larvae, achieved selective expression in motor and sensory neurons using existing transgenic lines, modified coelenterazine soaking protocol in order to conduct experiments at 4 days post-fertilization, created a behavioral bioluminescence assay for monitoring neuronal activity during acoustic evoked stereotyped escape responses in zebrafish larvae.

Although it has been tested with prospered efficiency in many cases, it also has some limitations: (1) it is hard to achieve coordinated and/or inducible expression of Cas9 and the sgRNAs; (2) manipulating multiple sgRNAs for multiplexed gene editing can be tedious, requiring multiple Pol III promoters. The traditional RNA polymerase II promoter can’t be used in driving sgRNA expression, extra nucleotides will be added to the 5 and z -ends of gRNA by RNA polymerase II and may interrupt the normal gRNA function. Additionally, RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II are exported rapidly into the cytoplasm while nuclear localization is required for the CRISPR-Cas9/gRNA duplex to access the genome editing (Lei et al., 2001). To overcome these obstacles, we use the ribozyme’s self-catalyzed cleavage to release the precise processing mature sgRNA under a RNA polymerase II promoter which drives expression of both Cas9 and sgRNA (named STU CRISPR-Cas9 system, Figure 1). Compared to the traditional small nuclear RNA promoters used in sgRNA expression, our STU CRISPR-Cas9 system has some advantages: (1) it’s shorter and easier in vector construction, and it will increase the transformation efficiency under some circumstances; (2) it only needs extra ribozyme flanking sequence (shorter than any RNA polymerase III promoter we are currently using) for multiple sgRNAs expression;(3) it has shown higher deletion efficiency induced by double sgRNAs. Thus, the STU CRISPR-Cas9 system driven by a single RNA polymerase II promoter can replace the traditional CRISPR-Cas9 system now we are using whether in vivo or in vitro if appropriate promoters are chosen.

Bio-protocol-2587	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2544	Expression and Purification of a Mammalian P2X7 Receptor from Sf9 Insect Cells	P2X7, Sf9, Baculovirus expression system, Eukaryotic membrane protein Background The P2X7 receptor is one of the seven subtypes of the purinergic P2X receptor family and has been a promising novel drug target for a wide range of diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain (North and Jarvis, 2013; Bhattacharya and Biber, 2016). Despite the well-documented clinical relevance, mechanisms underlying P2X7 specific functions are unclear. For example, it remains controversial whether P2X7 itself converts into a large pore or if P2X7 activation leads to an opening of another large-conductance channel such as pannexin1 (Alves et al., 2014).To unambiguously unravel the P2X7 receptor specific mechanisms, it is desirable to investigate the properties of this membrane channel in vitro in the absence of other proteins. It is also extremely advantageous to capture snapshots of the P2X7 receptor conformations throughout its gating cycle using techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. However, purification of eukaryotic membrane proteins is nontrivial due to low expression levels and instability in detergents. Furthermore, complex folding mechanisms and necessary post-translational modifications force researchers to use eukaryotic host cells, which is time and cost consuming. Though several laboratories have established their own protocols for purifying eukaryotic membrane proteins using insect cells (Karakas et al., 2011; Hattori and Gouaux, 2012), it is often challenging to mimic experimental conditions simply based on the methods reported in research papers, which normally lack tips and special notes due to space limitation. This protocol aims to provide an in-depth guide for expressing and purifying eukaryotic membrane proteins using an insect cell/baculovirus system. Based on this protocol, we have successfully purified milligram quantities of a mammalian P2X7 receptor, which we used to determine its crystal structures (Karasawa and Kawate, 2016).

The immature stages are always aquatic. Successful maintenance of mosquitoes in the laboratory depends on providing conditions that are optimal for each developmental stage. These requirements will vary with species, and in fact, many mosquito species, such as Cx. restuans, have not been colonized successfully in the lab. Colony maintenance is a labor-intensive process requiring time and attention to detail in handling and record keeping. When standard protocols are successful, the fitness of the mosquitoes is maintained and their suitability for repeatable experimentation is optimal. This protocol is designed for colonization and maintenance of fresh water Culex species and containerbreeding Aedes species. It has been used successfully with Cx. pipiens, Cx, quinquifasciatus, Cx. tarsalis, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. triseriatus, and Ae. japonicus, among others.
Bio-protocol-2590	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2541	Staining of Membrane Receptors with Fluorescently-labeled DNA Aptamers for Super-resolution Imaging	Microscopy, Super-resolution, STED, Aptamers, Affinity probes Background Recent advances in super-resolution imaging techniques have led to the search for more accurate methodologies to tag cellular elements. Diffraction unlimited imaging instruments provide  excellent  resolutions,  however  standard  sample  staining  methodologies,  such  as immunostaining, lack the necessary precision for the detection of cellular elements. Due to their large dimension ( 15~n m in length) and high molecular weight (150 k D a) , antibodies can poorly penetrate into biological samples. Additionally, the primary/secondary antibody complex places the fluorophores at approximately 25 nm away from the target, compromising the detection accuracy. Moreover, due to the large size of the primary/secondary antibody complex, a smaller fraction of the targets can be labelled due to the steric hindrance (Fornasiero and Opazo, 2015). This leads to lower labelling density, a  crucial  parameter  for  super-resolution  microscopy,  especially  in  recognizing  and  describing nanostructures. To circumvent these problems, small affinity probes that bind to single targets (monovalently) such as aptamers, affibodies or nanobodies have been tested in recent years (Rothbauer et al., 2006; Opazo et al., 2012; Ries et al., 2012) and are becoming valuable tools for super-resolution microscopy. Nanobodies, affibodies and aptamers have a relatively small linear size ( 3n m , 2 nm and 3n m , respectively). This property allows them to place the fluorescent dye in close proximity to the target, penetrate samples in a more efficient manner and bind to a higher fraction of target proteins, bypassing the effect of steric hindrance observed by antibodies (Ries et al., 2012; Mikhaylova et al., 2015). In a previous study we made a systematic comparison between three commercially available aptamers and antibodies that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2) and the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (Epha2). Our results showed that aptamers were able to find more epitopes (resulting in higher labeling density). As a consequence, several structural features of the subcellular components that were imaged became more apparent. Among these, the inner lumen and the complex morphology of endocytic organelles were visible. For these reasons, smaller imaging tools are becoming the preferred choice over antibodies, in order to improve the quality of an immunolabeling super-resolution approach and allow a more precise description the localization and the distribution of membrane receptors (Gomes de Castro et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2591	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2540	Protocol for Establishing a Multiplex Image-based Autophagy RNAi Screen in Cell Cultures	siRNA screen, Immunostaining, Immunofluorescence, Autophagy Background Autophagy is an intracellular quality and quantity control pathway by which diverse cytosolic material such as pathogens, organelles or parts thereof, proteins and other macromolecules are engulfed by double membrane structures coined autophagosomes and delivered for bulk lysosomal degradation upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Formation of autophagosomes and their maturation to autolysosomes is a highly regulated process. Among the AuTophaGy-related (ATG) genes initially identified in yeast is the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8, which exerts its function in a highly localized manner through its reversible conjugation to the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) located in the recipient autophagosome. Human cells contain six ATG8 family members that can be grouped into two subfamilies: i) microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3A), LC3B and LC3C and ii) γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 (Slobodkin and Elazar, 2013). Given the fact that yeast only harbors one Atg8 isoform, it is unclear whether LC3 and GABARAP proteins are functionally redundant or have unique properties. Members of the GABARAP family have been suggested to function late in autophagy, potentially promoting sealing of IMs or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes while LC3-proteins are believed to coordinate the expansion of autophagosomes, thus acting earlier than GABARAP proteins in the pathway (Weidberg et al., 2010). Importantly, overexpression or knockdown of one family member was shown to affect the expression levels of the other LC3 and GABARAP proteins (Weidberg et al., 2010). Therefore, our recent study (Jung et al., 2017) aimed to develop a screening platform for monitoring human ATG8 proteins (i.e., LC3B and GABARAP) at endogenous levels. This distinguishes our approach from other performed genome wide autophagy siRNA screens, in which overexpression of a GFP-tagged version of LC3B was employed (Orvedahl et al., 2011; McKnight et al., 2012). Besides LC3B and GABARAP, we additionally included autophagy marker proteins for the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes such as WIPI2 (WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2), ATG12 and STX17 (syntaxin 17), respectively. WIPI2 is recruited to phagophores by binding to the phospholipid  phosphatidylinositol  3-phosphate  (PI3P).  Upon  PI3P-binding,  WIPI2  recruits  the mammalian ATG8 lipidation complex comprised of the subunits ATG16L1, ATG5 and ATG12. Subsequently, LC3B is conjugated to PE and in turn can recruit several human ATG8-binding proteins including cargo receptors such as p62 (also known as SQSTM1), which lead to autophagy cargo engulfment. Fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes requires the SNARE protein STX17. STX17 localizes to closed autophagosomes and associates with SNAP29 and VAMP8 on lysosomes (Ktistakis and Tooze, 2016). Finally, intraluminal components are lysosomally degraded. Application of several autophagic marker proteins such as ATG12, WIPI2 and STX17 in addition to LC3B and GABARAP potentially allows the elucidation of genes specific for early and late phases of the autophagic process. The identification of various known as well as enigmatic autophagy proteins verified our screening approach (Jung et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2592	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2539	Extraction and Molybdenum Blue-based Quantification of	Alga, Chlorella, Parachlorella, Phosphorus, Polyphosphate, Molybdenum blue reaction Background Biological phosphorus recovery is a particularly attractive form of nutrient recycling. Algae can accumulate phosphate (Pi), and Pi-enriched algal biomass can be used as biofertilizer (Solovchenko et al., 2016). In a previous study, Ota et al. (2016) revealed the relationship between electron dense bodies and poly-P dynamics under sulfur-deficient (-S) conditions in Parachlorella kessleri. Parachlorella is a genus of green algae in the class Trebouxiophyceae, characterized by a rigid cell wall and an asexual, non-motile life cycle. The protocol presented here allows extraction of total Pi and polyphosphate (poly-P) from Chlorella and quantification of inorganic phosphorus based on molybdenum blue reaction, which is a standard method used to quantify orthophosphate. The theoretical background of the molybdenum blue reaction was reviewed previously by Nagul et al. (2015).
Bio-protocol-2593	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2538	Leaf Clearing Protocol to Observe Stomata and Other Cells on Leaf Surface	Leaf clearing, Stomata, DIC microscopy, Hoyer’s solution Background There are multiple ways to observe stomata and other epidermal cells such as hair cells on plant leaf surface. Traditionally a clear nail polish or wood glue is applied to the leaf surface and let dry. The leaf is peeled and observed under the microscope. Alternatively, scotch tape is applied to the leaf and removed to observe an imprint of the leaf surface. These traditional methods can be used for thicker leaves that are sturdy but the images are generally not of the highest quality. Small and delicate leaves such as Arabidopsis leaves require a more advanced method. A fresh Arabidopsis or Brachypodium leaf may also be observed directly under the microscope; however, the thickness and pigments in the leaf pose difficulties in viewing the stomata and other epidermal cells clearly. This protocol describes a method clearing of leaves for visualizing stomata including other epidermal cells and obtaining good quality images for publishing in peer-reviewed journals (Anderson, 1954).
Bio-protocol-2594	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2537	Purifying Properly Folded Cysteine-rich, Zinc Finger Containing Recombinant Proteins for Structural Drug Targeting Studies: the CH1 Domain of p300 as a Case Example	p300, CBP, HIF, CH1, Cysteine, Zinc finger, Hypoxia, Recombinant protein purification Background The growth of solid tumors is associated with the development of hypoxic areas due to inappropriate vascular irrigation. In response to a hypoxic microenvironment, tumor cells overexpress Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF), a family of heterodimeric transcription factors (Semenza, 2002; Brat and Van Meir, 2004; Kaur et al., 2005). HIFs bind to p300, a transcriptional coactivator, to form a complex that induces HIF target genes, thereby activating the hypoxia response pathway and promoting tumor growth (Kasper and Brindle, 2006; Liu, 2008). The binding domains involved with the HIF/p300 proteinprotein interface are the cysteine-histidine-rich region 1 (CH1) domain of p300 and the C-terminal activating domain (CAD) of HIF-1α (Dames et al., 2002; Freedman et al., 2002). The hypoxia response pathway facilitates tumor growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Inhibiting this pathway is a goal for targeted anti-cancer therapy (Post et al., 2004; Belozerov and Van Meir, 2006; Mooring, 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Mun et al., 2012; Wilkins et al., 2016). Small molecule compounds have recently been developed to bind to p300-CH1 and inhibit p300/HIF complexation, inhibiting the hypoxia response pathway and reducing tumor growth (Shi et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2012; Burroughs et al., 2013).

The predator’s odorous substance, such as excretion and fur particles, triggers anxiety in the rodent without direct contact and induces avoidance or freezing behavior, depending on the circumstances. For example, if a mouse is not able to run away from the source of the odor (e.g., confined to a small box), the mouse freezes. If the mouse can run away, they will avoid the source of the odor rather than freeze (Hacquemand et al., 2010; Johnston et al., 2012). TMT (2,4,5- trimethylthiazoline), a component of fox feces, is the most used synthesizable reagent for inducing innate fear in rodents (Vernet-Maury et al., 1984). Wallace et al. found that innate fear responses of rats can be quantified by measuring the freezing duration when the animals are exposed to TMT in a small confined space. They also found that innate fear responses to TMT do not induce conditioned learning. This finding indicates that different neural pathways are activated during TMT exposure from those activated during conventional footshock-induced fear responses. Lesion studies have shown that the regions associated with the innate fear responses include the medial/central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) (Fendt et al., 2003; Müller and Fendt, 2006). Here, I present conventional methods for measuring TMT-induced fear responses in the mouse.

Bio-protocol-2599	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2532	Ubiquitin Proteasome Activity Measurement in Total Plant Extracts	Proteasome, Immunity, Plant defense, Targeted proteolysis, Fluorogenic substrate Background The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major protein degradative machinery in eukaryotic cells and as such the UPS is essential for the regulation of many cellular processes, including signaling, cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, and immunity. Proteins destined for turnover are marked by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin and then degraded by the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is composed of two subparticles, the 20S core protease (CP) that compartmentalizes the protease active sites and the 19S regulatory particle that recognizes and translocates appropriate substrates into the CP lumen for breakdown. Proteasome activity is modulated in order to maintain proteostasis in response to fluctuating internal and external conditions. We have recently shown that the UPS is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and a range of plant and animal pathogens subvert the UPS to enhance their virulence (Üstün et al., 2013; Üstün et al., 2014; Üstün and Börnke, 2015; Üstün et al., 2016). In plants, proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense and adapted bacterial pathogens can interfere with this induction using specific virulence factors. This protocol describes an assay to assess the relative chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity of the proteasome in total plant extracts using a fluorogenic substrate. This assay is carried out in a 96-well format using a plate reader and thus is amendable to medium to high throughput and can easily be modified to measure additional proteolytic activities of the proteasome by exchanging the substrate accordingly.

Malignant tumors may be initiated and maintained by a stem cell population (Nassar and Blanpain, 2016; Bonnet and Dick, 1997), and these cells represent an important therapeutic target to prevent relapse (Baumann et al., 2008). Studies suggest that squamous cell carcinomas are maintained by a subpopulation of tumor cancer stem cells that are resistant to therapy and can initiate tumor recurrence by undergoing self-renewal and differentiation, like normal stem cells, giving rise to proliferating progenitor cells that differentiate and form the bulk of the tumor (Locke et al., 2005; Prince et al., 2007; Malanchi et al., 2008; de Sousa e Melo et al., 2017). In this scenario, tumor cell fate and behavior are determined by the specific combination of changes in genes or their expression that have occurred during tumor development (Wang, 2010). Alternatively, progenitor cells can also acquire mutations that give them the potential to self-renew or can acquire some plasticity that give them cancer stem cell properties (Shimokawa et al., 2017). Regardless of the origin of cancer stem cells, efficient techniques to isolate these cells while maintaining their viability is essential. We have extensively characterized cancer stem cells from anorectal transition zone squamous cell carcinoma which arise spontaneously in the absence of epithelial T G F signaling (Keratin14Cre; Tgfbr2flox/flox mice) (Guasch et al., 2007;

CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9) technology has proven to have great efficiency and generalizability both in gene editing and gene regulation (Qi et al., 2013; La Russa and Qi, 2015). CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of Cas9 endonuclease and a target-identifying CRISPR RNA duplex (crRNA and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA)) that can be simplified into a single guide RNA (sgRNA). sgRNA sequence can match and target with an 18- to 25-bp DNA sequence, with a required DNA motif termed the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) adjacent to the binding site. The most commonly used type of Cas9 is derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, and the PAM sequence is NGG (N represents any nucleotide), while NAG works sporadically with lower efficiency.

Bio-protocol-2612	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2519	Quantification of Membrane Damage/Cell Death Using Evan’s Blue Staining Technique	Evan’s blue, Membrane damage, Cell death Background Plants are sessile organisms that are exposed to a diverse array of stress factors. The membrane is made up of lipids and glycoproteins and act as a physical, protective barrier. The fluidity of the cell membrane is altered when the cell is exposed to stress such as heat. Oxidative stress can damage cell membranes. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with oxidative stress can act on membrane lipids to decrease membrane stability. An established protocol to assess membrane stability, known as Sullivan’s method, quantifies the extent of electrolyte leakage from the membrane (Sullivan and Ross, 1979). This method is time-consuming, tedious and involves several steps. Additionally, since this method usually requires exposure of the tissue to high temperature (Initial electrolyte leakage and final electrolyte leakage after boiling at high temperature), this method cannot be used to assess the instantaneous damage to membranes in plants exposed to stress. We adapted a reliable Evan’s blue staining technique that has been used by many researchers to assess cell death or membrane damage (Smith et al., 1982; Oprisko et al., 1990; Vemanna et al., 2017) for instantly monitoring stress. Evan’s blue is an acidic, non-permitting exclusion dye which stains dead or damaged cells. The dye does not enter live cells with stable membranes (Gaff and Okong’O-Ogala, 1971). One advantage of this method is that it does not subject the tissue to high temperature. Though microscopic visualization is effective, large sample sizes make this type of analysis too time consuming (Baker and Mock, 1994). We have altered our method to analyze spectrophotometrically. Evan’s blue stain can be extracted from intact cells and analyze by spectrophotometer. Our method is highly reproducible and it can be adapted to large scale phenotyping of genotypes. The other membrane penetrating dye phenosafranin can also be used but some difficulties have been reported that it will not stain the cells without nuclei (ghost cell) and also the uptake is affected by pH (Baker and Mock, 1994).
Bio-protocol-2613	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2518	Teratoma Formation Assay for Assessing Pluripotency and Tumorigenicity of Pluripotent Stem Cells	Pluripotent stem cells, Teratoma, Tumorigenicity, NOD/SCID mice, Testis Background iPSCs and ESCs are exploited for applications in cell transplantation therapy for regenerative medicine. However, these cells form tumors called teratoma containing differentiated tissues when transplanted into immune-deficient mice. Therefore, the risk of their teratoma-forming tumorigenicity limits their clinical application. Several studies have reported the methods to overcome the risk of teratoma-forming tumorigeniticy (Itakura et al., 2017; Vazquez-Martin et al., 2012). Recently, we reported that iPSCs derived from naked mole-rats lack teratoma-forming tumorigenicity when engrafted into the testes of NOD/SCID mice due to species-specific activation of tumor-suppressor ARF and a disruption mutation of the oncogene ERAS (Miyawaki et al., 2016). In this protocol, we describe a method for transplanting pluripotent stem cells into the testes of NOD/SCID mice to generate teratomas. This approach can minimize the immune rejection due to the presence of the testicular– blood barrier (Cheng and Mruk, 2012). In addition, this approach is advantageous because transplanted cells are easily identified around the injection site even when they do not form tumors. Thus, the technique described herein is useful for assessing the pluripotency and tumorigenicity of pluripotent stem cells.
Bio-protocol-2614	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2517	Rapid Profiling Cell Cycle by Flow Cytometry Using Concurrent Staining of DNA and Mitotic Markers	Cell cycle, Mitosis, Hypotonic buffer, Propidium iodide, Histone H3 Background Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry is mainly based on measurement of DNA content by stain with propidium iodide (PI). The stoichiometric nature of PI ensures the accurate quantification of DNA content and allows us to reveal the distribution of cells in G_1 , S and G_2 cell cycle stage or in subG_1 cell death stage, the latter of which is characterized by DNA fragmentation. Most of the commonly used methods for PI-based DNA quantification require fixation using alcohol or aldehyde, which is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. In addition, these methods are incompatible with staining of mitotic markers by fluorescent-labeled antibodies. Therefore, we adopted and optimized a previous established hypotonic buffer to permeabilize cells, allowing simultaneous staining of DNA with PI and mitotic marker, phospho-Histone H3 (pH3), with pH3 specific antibody (Riccardi et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016). This method enables a rapid (within 20m i n ) and comprehensive analysis of cell cycle profile (G1, S, G_2 and M phase).

Bio-protocol-2617	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2514	An Optimized Method for the Production Using PEI, Titration and Neutralization of SARS-CoV Spike Luciferase Pseudotypes	SARS coronavirus, Lentiviral pseudotype, Virus neutralization Background The production and use of pseudotyped viral particles (PV) is widely established for many viruses,  and  applications  in  the  fields  of  serology,  surveillance  and  vaccine development are manifold (Temperton et al., 2015; Carnell et al., 2015). PVs have proven to be powerful tools to study the effects of viral envelope glycoprotein mutations on serological outcomes, viral tropism and immunogenicity studies especially when combined with epitope information. PVs are chimeric viral constructs in which the outer (surface) glycoprotein(s) of one virus is combined with the replication-defective viral ‘core’ of another virus. PV allow for accurate, sequence-directed, sensitive antibody neutralization assays and antiviral screening to be conducted within a low biosecurity facility and offer a safe and efficient alternative to wildtype virus use, making them exquisitely beneficial for many emerging RNA viruses of pandemic potential. Many of the published protocols require modification of the SARS spike glycoprotein and/or  expensive transfection reagents (Temperton, 2009). The protocol presented here utilizes the full-length,  noncodon-optimized spike protein in conjunction with the low-cost transfection reagent PEI, making this protocol widely applicable to many stakeholder laboratories. Figure 1 shows a cartoon of the lentiviral SARS-CoV PV production process directed by plasmid co-transfection.

Bio-protocol-2619	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2512	Establishment of a Human Cell Line Persistently Infected with Sendai Virus	Sendai virus, Persistence, IRF3, Apoptosis, P2.1 Background IRF3 is essential for initiating antiviral defense mechanisms in host cells by way of promoting transcription of antiviral genes (Hiscott, 2007; Chattopadhyay and Sen, 2017). Upon recognition of viral dsRNA by PRRs in the cell, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE), and promotes transcription of type-1 interferons, e.g., IFN-  . IRF3 is also critical for triggering apoptosis via a distinct pathway, which does not require its transcriptional activity. In a series of previous studies, we have discovered the pathway, which we named RIPA that triggers apoptosis in virus-infected cells. In RIPA, IRF3 interacts with BCL-2-Associated X protein (BAX), a pro-apoptotic factor (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). Upon binding to BAX, IRF3 translocates to the mitochondria, and initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately promotes apoptosis (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). In the absence of IRF3 or other components of RIPA, the cells establish viral persistence when infected with Sendai virus (SeV) (Peters et al., 2008; Chattopadhyay et al., 2013). These persistent cell lines are useful for studying the full antiviral mechanisms of cells because the cells do not undergo apoptotic cell death. In the current protocol, we provide a detailed method to create a SeV persistent human cell line, which are defective in IRF3 expression. Viral persistence is common for many viruses, which efficiently antagonize the cell death pathways of the infected cells. An in vitro approach to study persistently infected cells will reveal ways to avoid the establishment of viral persistence. It will also be evaluated in future whether the absence of RIPA can be used as a tool to generate persistently infected cells using viruses of different lifestyles.

Bio-protocol-2622	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2509	Macrophage Survival Assay Using High Content Microscopy	Macrophage, Cell survival, High-content microscope Background Macrophages are phagocytic innate immune cells and are the main drivers of inflammation in tissue (Medzhitov, 2008). These cells are associated with cancer together with autoimmune, autoinflammatory, infectious, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases (Ginhoux and Jung, 2014). In this context, the role of macrophages in inflammation is well-studied, however, the impact of macrophage survival in non-infectious and infectious diseases is largely unknown. Our study showed that the activation of certain pathogen-associated receptors (PRRs) can induce macrophage survival (Eren et al., 2016). We described a molecular mechanism that demonstrated how an obligate intracellular pathogen exploits PRR-induced cell survival (Eren et al., 2016). Thus, further studies are necessary to understand the role of macrophage survival in different disease settings.

Various biological processes in organisms result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause oxidative stress. In response to such oxidative stress, organisms can deploy superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to scavenge ROS so as to protect the cellular homeostasis (Balaban et al., 2005). On the one hand, various chemicals (pollutants) can retard such antioxidant responses, and disturb the health of organisms including human beings. On the other hand, many pharmaceuticals aim to strengthen the antioxidant responses to improve health. Therefore, activities of SOD and CAT are very important to reflect potential effects of chemicals or/and pharmaceuticals.

Bio-protocol-2630	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2501	A High-throughput Assay for mRNA Silencing in Primary Cortical Neurons in vitro with Oligonucleotide Therapeutics	Primary cortical neurons, siRNA, Screening, Branched DNA, QuantiGene 2.0 Background Oligonucleotide therapeutics represent a new class of drug that can target any genetically defined disorder, by silencing the expression of mutant proteins. Specifically, siRNAs are double stranded oligonucleotides that are loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) and can silence mRNA before it is translated. However, unmodified siRNAs are unstable and cannot enter cells without the help of cationic lipid formulation, which can be toxic to primary cells such as neurons. In this protocol, we use self-delivering, hydrophobically modified siRNAs (hsiRNAs) for mRNA silencing. Recent progress in the chemistry of oligonucleotides has enabled the design of these stabilized hsiRNAs, which promote cellular internalization, efficient entry into RISC, and potent knockdown of target genes (Byrne et al., 2013; Alterman et al., 2015; Ly et al., 2017). These compounds contain acute2 -O-methyl and 2’-fluoro modifications on all sugars and phosphorothioate backbone modifications; the oligonucleotides are often conjugated to a hydrophobic moiety, such as cholesterol, to support membrane binding and cellular internalization without toxicity. This new class of compounds offers researchers a straightforward method for silencing various genes in the context of biologically relevant, and hard to transfect, primary cortical neurons (Alterman et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-2658	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2473	Measurement of Dopamine Using Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry in Rodent Brain Slices	"Electrochemistry, Voltammetry, FSCV, Dopamine, Rodent, Slice physiology Background Since the ability to examine the electrical properties of physiological systems was first appropriated for use in preclinical scientific research, many techniques used to study synaptic physiology have been developed. From the early days of electrophysiological recordings in squid axons to present day fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) performed in human Parkinson’s patients (Kishida et al., 2016; Lohrenz et al., 2016), the field has made significant advances in a relatively short amount of time. This protocol’s focus, FSCV, is the technical result of over 40 years of innovation and collaboration between physicists, analytical chemists, and neuroscientists. While electrochemistry was born with Michael Faraday and Alessandro Volta as early as the 19^th century (Bard and Zoski, 2000), modern voltammetry did not come to fruition until the 1920s with Jaroslav Heyrovsky in his quest to measure the surface tension of mercury (Heyrovsky, 1922). Through his pursuit, Heyrovsky developed a dropping mercury electrode to perform polarography. This technique would be introduced as ""voltammetry"" in the United States in the 1940s and utilized platinum, gold, or carbon electrodes, in addition to the dropping mercury electrode, to study metal ions in solution. With the advent of computing technology, voltammetry methodology advanced dramatically from the late 1960s to today (for review see Bard and Zoski, 2000). Of note, in the 1970s, Ralph Adams pioneered the use of voltammetry, using a fast scanning method, in translational neuroscience specifically to study oxidizable neurotransmitters (Adams, 1976), a technique further applied to awake, freely-moving animals by Mark Wightman (Bucher and Wightman, 2015)."

More recently, Robinson and Berridge (2013) have shown that this immediate increase in salt-seeking behavior occurs to discrete salt-paired cues following sodium depletion in the absence of salt before it has been tasted as a desirable reward. In addition, adaptive salt-seeking has also been observed with contextual cues following sodium depletion (Stouffer and White, 2005).

Bio-protocol-2681	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2450	Cell-free Generation of COPII-coated Procollagen I Carriers	COPII, Collagen, Membrane, Budding, Reconstitution Background The coat protein complex II (COPII) plays an essential role in transporting secretory cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) en route to the Golgi apparatus. The genes required for cargo traffic from the ER were discovered in genetic studies in yeast and the precise roles of the protein products of the genes required for vesicle budding were elucidated with the aid of a cell-free vesicle budding reaction supplemented with purified components (Novick et al., 1981; Kaiser et al., 1990; Barlowe et al., 1994). A similar reaction was developed to detect the role of COPII in cargo traffic from the ER in cultured mammalian cells (Kim et al., 2005). Mammalian COPII-coated vesicles are approximately 80-100 nm in diameter, which is seemingly too small to accommodate large secretory cargos such as the rigid 300 nm procollagen I (PC1) triple helical rod. Despite the potential size discrepancy, COPII is essential for the secretion of large cargos including PC1 (Boyadjiev et al., 2006). Recently, we reported the existence of bona fide large COPII-coated PC1 carriers, exceeding 300 n m in diameter, in cells evaluated by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), correlated light electron microscopy (CLEM) and live-cell imaging (Gorur et al., 2017). Cell-free COPII budding reactions that successfully reconstituted small COPII vesicles did not allow the detection of large COPII-coated PC1 carriers (Fromme and Schekman, 2005). Therefore, we devised an alternative vesicle budding protocol to allow the detection of PC1 packaged into large COPII vesicles as well as the characterization of both small and large COPII-coated vesicles. Using this new protocol, we showed that the capture of PC1 into large COPII vesicles requires COPII proteins and the GTPase activity of the COPII subunit SAR1 (Gorur et al., 2017).

Determination of the guard cell expression of a gene is essential for studying its role in stomatal movements. There are several ways to identify the expression of a gene in guard cells. One way is to check the RNA expression of a gene in guard cells by RT-PCR (Jeon et al., 2008; Takimiya et al., 2013). To do so, the protoplasts of mesophyll and guard cells need to be separated. Another way is to check the GUS signal in guard cells of the transgenic plant expressing GUS driven by a gene’s native promoter. In some reports, the evidence of both RNA expression and GUS signal in guard cells were provided (Zheng et al., 2002; Jeon et al., 2008). As for the GUS signal in guard cells, if a gene is specifically expressed in guard cells, like OST1, MYB60, ROP11 and RopGEF4, a distinguished GUS signal in guard cells can be obtained from a GUS staining image with whole leaf (Mustilli et al., 2002; Li et al., 2012; Li and Liu, 2012; Rusconi et al., 2013). However, if a gene is expressed in both mesophyll and guard cells, like ROP10 and RopGEF2, the GUS signal in guard cells is hard to be distinguished from the mesophyll background (Zheng et al., 2002; Li and Liu, 2012). After GUS staining procedure, the leaf will become soft, and it is very difficult to peel the epidermal strips. Therefore, just after the leaf was excised from the plants, we peeled the epidermal strips from the leaf, and the strips were used for GUS staining after the mesophyll cells were removed. By this method, we obtained a clear guard cell GUS image of ROP7, a gene expressed in both mesophyll and guard cells.

Bio-protocol-2690	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2441	Isolation of Keratan Sulfate Disaccharide-branched Chondroitin Sulfate E from Mactra chinensis	Mactra chinensis, Glycosaminoglycan, Chondroitin sulfate, Keratan sulfate, Galactose Background GAGs are found in tissues as the glycan moieties of proteoglycan (PG) glycoconjugates. CS is a GAG type composed of linear, sulfated repeating disaccharide sequences of N-acetyl-Dgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA). Another GAG type, DS, is biosynthesized through the action of glucuronyl C5-epimerase on CS, converting its GlcA to the CS epimer, iduronic acid (IdoA). The other GAG types HS and HEP are consisted of sulfated repeating disaccharide sequence of N acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and GlcA/IdoA. KS is composed of sulfated repeating disaccharide sequences of GlcNAc and galactose. Among them, structural variations of CS, such as sulfation patterns and fucosylation, depend on the species and tissue of origin. For example, the A-unit with the structure -4)GlcA(β1-3)GalNAc4S(β1- (where S designates a sulfonate residue) is a predominant disaccharide found in mammalian or chicken tracheal cartilage CS, while the C-unit with the structure -4)GlcA(β1- 3)GalNAc6S(β1- is a major disaccharide found in shark cartilage or salmon nasal cartilage CS. In contrast,  a  significant  amount  of  the  D-unit  disaccharide  -4)GlcA2S(β1-3)GalNAc6S(β1-  is characteristically found in CS isolated from shark cartilage, while the E-unit disaccharide -4)GlcA(β1- 3)GalNAc4S,6S(β1- is characteristic in squid cartilage. In sea cucumber, a sulfated fucose branches at the 3-OH position of GlcA. The disaccharide composition of CS governs its biological activities, including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, cell-cell crosstalk, adhesion and wound repair through the interaction with growth factors, receptors, and other CS-binding proteins. Evidence suggests that CS structure is tightly correlated with function. For example, consecutive and disulfated disaccharide units including B, D and E-units in CS are critical for the interaction between CS and binding proteins (Hikino et al., 2003). A branched fucose at the 3-OH position of GlcA is also required for the anticoagulant activity of fucosylated CS (Mourão et al., 1996).
Bio-protocol-2691	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2440	A Protocol of Using White/Red Color Assay to Measure Amyloid-induced Oxidative Stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Amyloid, Oxidative stress, ROS, Yeast, ade1 mutant, TDP-43, DCFDA Background The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells mutant for ADE1 or ADE2 genes (e.g., ade1∆, ade2∆, ade1-14, ade2-1), when grown on YPD (Yeast Peptone Dextrose) medium, accumulate red pigment in the vacuole which is an intermediate metabolite of adenine biosynthesis pathway (Sharma et al., 2003). The suppressible allele ade1-14 which contains a premature stop codon, has been widely used to score for P S I^+ prion state of the translation termination factor Sup35 protein. In a psi- yeast, the Sup35p remains soluble and functional, therefore translation is terminated efficiently at the premature stop codon of the ade1-14 allele leading to synthesis of truncated and non-functional Ade1 protein. Thus, the adenine biosynthesis cascade remains incomplete leading to accumulation of intermediate metabolite yielding the red phenotype of the psi- yeast. In contrast, in a P S I^+ yeast, the Sup35p is aggregated and partially inactivated, thereby causing read-through of the premature nonsense codon of the ade1-14 allele that leads to functional Ade1 protein synthesis. Thus, adenine biosynthesis pathway is completed and no red intermediate metabolite is accumulated, consequently giving the P S I^+ cells, a white phenotype (Chernoff et al., 1993). In the view that the red color development from this adenine biosynthesis intermediate metabolite requires presence of reduced glutathione(Sharma et al., 2003), we reasoned that presence of oxidative stress which would oxidize glutathione, would also cause white color conversion alike to the white phenotype of the P S I^+ yeast. Additionally, it is known that the aggregations of several amyloid proteins cause cellular oxidative stress, therefore we attempted to develop a red/white reporter color assay for amyloid-induced oxidative stress in the ade1/ade2 mutant yeast background similar to the widely used red/white assay for the p s i^ to P S I^+ conversion (Bharathi et al., 2016). We present here red/white color switch assay using two amyloid-like proteins, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), both of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of the motor neuron disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Rossi et al., 2016). Such simplistic color assay for amyloid-induced oxidative stress in yeast has never been reported previous to our Bharathi et al., 2016 manuscript and has the potential to be a highly useful methodology to study for amyloid protein-induced toxicity in yeast.
Bio-protocol-2692	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2439	Wheat Coleoptile Inoculation by Fusarium graminearum for Large-scale Phenotypic Analysis	Fusarium graminearum, Wheat coleoptile, Plant-fungal interaction, Pathogenicity assays Background Fusarium graminearum (previously also called Gibberella zeae) is a destructive pathogen that upon infection is responsible for causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) and seedling blight on cereal crops, as well as stalk and ear rot on maize (Dal Bello et al., 2002; Bai and Shaner, 2004; Kazan et al., 2012). Extensive molecular and genetic studies have been performed to investigate the interaction between F. graminearum and wheat. Given the availability of an efficient genetic transformation system and the well annotated genome, hundreds of F. graminearum genes have been investigated for their roles in vegetative growth, sexual development, secondary metabolism, stress responses and even virulence on host (Jia and Tang, 2015). However, only a few fungal effectors (e.g., FGL1 and deoxynivalenol) and host resistance genes (e.g., wheat Fhb1) have been identified (Proctor et al., 1995; Blümke et al., 2014; Rawat et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2700	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2431	Selection of Genetically Modified Bacteriophages Using the CRISPR-Cas System	Bacteriophage, Escherichia coli, Homologous recombination, Positive selection Background Bacteriophages (phages) are the most prevalent and widely distributed biological entity in the biosphere, highlighting their ecological importance (Suttle, 2007). Many studies also propose using phages for medical purposes (Weber-Dabrowska et al., 2001; Merril et al., 2003; Harper and Enright, 2011; Edgar et al., 2012; Bikard et al., 2014; Citorik et al., 2014; Yosef et al., 2014 and 2015). Unfortunately, only a few published methods detail genetic engineering of phage genomes (Selick et al., 1988; Marinelli et al., 2008; Pires et al., 2016) and in addition, some of these methods are tedious, and some cannot achieve desired results such as seamless deletions. A simple and efficient technique for seamless genetic engineering of phages is thus desired. In this protocol, we present a technique described in 2014 (Kiro et al., 2014) for deleting genes of the E. coli phage, T7. We first designed genetic constructs that facilitate desired homologous recombination events. We then used the CRISPR-Cas type I-E system to select desired engineered phages. Several other studies have also reported the use of CRISPR-Cas systems to engineer phages and the reader is referred to them for selecting the most appropriate and fitting protocols for the specific requirements (Martel and Moineau, 2014; Box et al., 2015; Lemay et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2701	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2430	Purification of FLAG-tagged Secreted Proteins from Mammalian Cells	Secreted protein, Purification, Mammalian, Ligand, Receptor Background E. coli is one of the organisms of choice for production of recombinant proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The major advantages of bacterial expression systems are high productivity and low cost. However, mature proteins are essential for functional analyses (e.g., ligand binding assays). Most secreted eukaryotic proteins undergo post-translational modification by covalent glycan linkage and formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum. These covalent modifications are essential for the general stability and folding of the secreted mature proteins. Therefore, the best method for production of mammalian secreted proteins is the use of a mammalian host to ensure the production of recombinant proteins that have undergone proper post-translational modifications. In the following protocol, we have described the detailed procedure for purification of secreted proteins from mammalian cells. This protocol is for production of FLAG-tagged proteins, but should be applicable to that of other tagged (e.g., His-tag) proteins as well.

Examples of lipid-specific poreformation include Plasmodium CelTOS that depends on phosphatidic acid for pore formation, and the cholesterol dependent cytolysins (Jimah et al., 2016; Lukoyanova et al., 2016). CelTOS (cell traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites) is a malaria parasite protein that disrupts host cell membranes by pore formation to enable the exit of parasites from invaded host cells during cell traversal (Kariu et al., 2006; Jimah et al., 2016). Cholesterol dependent cytolysins are a large class of pore-forming proteins, including virulence factors of gram positive bacteria such as pneumolysin and listeriolysin (Lukoyanova et al., 2016). Identifying the specific lipids targeted informs the mechanism of membrane disruption that underlies biological function and role of proteins and biomolecules.

Bio-protocol-2707	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2424	Primary Culture System for Germ Cells from Caenorhabditis elegans	C. elegans, Primary culture, Germ stem cells, Tissue culture Background C. elegans hermaphrodite germ cells are generated in two adult stem cell niches located in the distal regions of the two gonad arms (Hansen and Schedl, 2013; Kimble and Seidel, 2013). In wild-type hermaphrodites, mitotic germ cells are restricted to the distal, stem cell niche regions of the gonad arms. Wild-type germ cells are syncytial, and contain an opening to a common cytoplasm that extends through the central region of the gonad arms. C. elegans tumorous germline mutants have increased mitotic proliferation of germ cells throughout the gonad. We discovered that tumorous germline mutants generally have fully cellularized germ cells that contain intact plasma membranes (Chaudhari et al., 2016). This cellularization allows the isolation of the germ cells and their maintenance in culture. This protocol describes the methodology and tissue culture medium to isolate and maintain germ cells from tumorous mutants in culture. While a culture medium has been described for the primary culture of C. elegans embryonic and larval cells (Strange et al., 2007; Zhang and Kuhn, 2013), germ cells do not survive in this medium (Chaudhari et al., 2016). We created a culture medium for germ cells that is called CeM1 for ‘C. elegans medium 1’. We anticipate that other iterations of the medium could be given subsequent numbers, e.g., ‘CeM2’. This protocol, first reported in Chaudhari et al., 2016, allows the isolation of essentially pure populations of germ cells and their maintenance in in vitro primary cultures. This culture system can allow new experimental approaches to probe germ cell biology in C. elegans.
Bio-protocol-2708	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2423	Preparation of Crude Synaptosomal Fractions from	Brain, Synaptosome, Fractionation, Homogenization, Extraction, Synapse Background Analyzing synaptosomes, representing isolated synaptic terminals from neurons, can yield valuable information on synaptic integrity in diverse neurological diseases. They contain membrane-bound compartments that detach from axon terminals after brain homogenization under certain conditions. The current protocol describes a fast and easy method for the enrichment of crude synaptosomal fractions (see Figure 1). These can be either used for quantification of synaptic proteins by Western-blot or can be further purified using density gradient centrifugation to yield highly purified synaptosome subfractions (Gurd et al., 1974). The preparation of crude synaptosomal fractions might be sufficient to assess e.g., the amount of pre- and post-synaptic proteins like SNAP25 or post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in e.g., mouse models with a neurodegenerative phenotype (Breyhan et al., 2009; Saul and Wirths, 2017).

It can also be applied to other tissue samples and yields a soluble fraction containing hydrophilic proteins and an insoluble fraction consisting of more hydrophobic proteins. Following an initial homogenization in a lysis buffer containing no detergent, the supernatant including the soluble protein fraction is removed and the pellet containing the insoluble fraction can be further extracted using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) as detergent to ensure entire cell lysis (see Figure 1). This approach can facilitate the analysis of low-abundance proteins by reducing the complexity of the sample.
Bio-protocol-2710	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2421	Polyamine and Paraquat Transport Assays in Arabidopsis Seedling and Callus	Arabidopsis thaliana, Polyamine, Paraquat, Transport, Uptake Background PAs are involved in gene regulation by interacting with and modulating the functions of anionic macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. In living cells, PAs’ contents must be regulated to maintain the cellular hemostasis. In higher plants, three major polyamines, putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm), are present in either free form or conjugated forms with other molecules (Gill and Tuteja, 2010). In yeast, four plasma membrane polyamine transporters, DUR3, SAM3, GAP1 and AGP2 were identified (Uemura et al., 2007). In Arabidopsis, five putative polyamine uptake transporters (PUT1-PUT5) were identified and PUT1-3 have been experimentally validated as polyamine transporters (Mulangi et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). Our protocol described below has successfully confirmed that PUT3 is an influx transporter for polyamines and paraquat, and PQ/Spd uptake is impaired in the put3 mutant (Shen et al., 2016).

Aberrations in this well-balanced system threaten cellular homeostasis and induce several maintenance systems aimed at restoring the balance (Kim et al., 2013). Protein AMPylation is directly linked to cellular stress: AMPylation of Rho GTPases by bacterial toxins rewires GTPase-dependent signaling, eventually leading to a collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and cell death (Yarbrough et al., 2009; Mattoo et al., 2011). In contrast, AMPylation of Grp78/BiP in the ER keeps this chaperone in a primed, yet silent conformation to be awoken and set in motion once the burden of unfolded protein in the ER surpasses a certain threshold (Preissler et al., 2015; Sanyal et al., 2015). We and others have extensively used in vitro AMPylation assays to study general properties, target selectivity as well as reaction kinetics of Fic domain-containing AMPylases. We used a combination of distinct in vitro AMPylation assays to i) identify novel targets in complex cell lysates, ii) validate suspected targets and iii) approach the role of
Bio-protocol-2716	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2415	Using CRISPR/Cas9 for Large Fragment Deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	CRISPR/Cas9 system, Large fragment deletion, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Background The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a rapid, efficient, low-cost, and versatile method for genome editing that can be applied in the fields of biology, agriculture, and medicine. To date, several protocols have been reported on how to make large-scale deletions within genomes. Each of these methods  contains  its  own  unique  characteristics  and  advantages.  The  recently  developed CRISPR/Cas9 system for excising large stretches of chromosomes has potential advantages over other methods such as the Latour system (Hirashima et al., 2006). The CRISPR/Cas9 system requires two components: (1) the Cas9 endonuclease for DNA cleavage and (2) a variable guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 enzyme in a DNA sequence-specific manner (Cong et al., 2013). When Cas9 is targeted to a genomic locus by a gRNA, Cas9 initiates a DSB. The cell will respond to the DSB by repairing the damage via one of two major pathways: high-fidelity homology-dependent repair or errorprone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
Bio-protocol-2717	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2414	Determination of Survival of Wildtype and Mutant Escherichia coli in Soil	Soil survival, Escherichia coli, RpoS, Environmental persistence, Bacteria recovery Background  Escherichia  coli  is  a  Gram-negative,  facultative  anaerobe,  belonging  to  the Enterobacteriaceae family, which inhabits the intestinal tract of humans, warm-blooded animals and reptiles (Berg, 1996; Gordon and Cowling, 2003). It can be transferred through water and sediments via faeces and is used as an indicator of faecal contamination in drinking and recreational water. The use of E. coli as a faecal indicator is based, at least in part, on the assumption that it exists transiently outside of the host gastrointestinal tract (Ishii and Sadowsky, 2008) and does not survive for a long time in the external environment. However, several studies have isolated E. coli from various natural environments such as municipal wastewater, freshwater, beach water, beach sand and soils (Jiménez et al., 1989; Brennan et al., 2010; Chiang et al., 2011; Byappanahalli et al., 2012; Zhi et al., 2016). The capacity of these E. coli strains to survive for long periods of time and grow in the external environment raises questions about the validity of its continued use as indicator of water quality (Brennan et al., 2010). To understand the genetic mechanism underlying the survival and persistence of E. coli in soil, we developed a soil survival assay to evaluate the role of the different genetic factors on soil survival. We investigated the role of the general stress response regulator, RpoS, in the survival of long-term soil persistent E. coli in soil. The ability of the rpoS mutant (COB583ΔrpoS) to survive in soil was compared with the wildtype strain (COB583) and RpoS was demonstrated to be important for the survival and longterm persistence of E. coli in soil (Somorin et al., 2016). Here, we present the detailed protocol for the soil survival assay and the recovery of E. coli from soil.

This protocol aims to isolate limbal cells by their functional ability to form spheres in culture and which by their very nature will include a diversity of cells both epithelial and stromal which contribute to the formation of the limbal niche. Subsequent to isolation of these spheres we are investigating their potential use in corneal restoration after implantation. Here we describe an in-vitro surgical protocol for the implantation of these spheres into human corneal tissue and the downstream analysis.

Bio-protocol-2722	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2409	Rice Lamina Joint Inclination Assay	Bioassay, Brassinosteroid, Lamina inclination, Lamina joint, Rice Background The rice lamina joint connects the leaf blade and sheath, contributing significantly to the leaf angle trait and BR is the main regulator of the trait, while other plant hormones, including ethylene, gibberellin, and auxin, also influence leaf angle (Gan et al., 2015). A more erect leaf facilitates the penetration of sunlight, enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and occupying less space in dense planting (Sakamoto et al., 2006). Thus, rice lamina inclination is one of the major agronomic traits affecting rice plant architecture. Actually, the rice lamina inclination assay developed mainly by Wada and his co-workers is a highly specific and sensitive bioassay for BRs (Wada et al., 1981 and 1984). In this bioassay, treatment with BRs induces greater cell expansion of adaxial cells relative to the abaxial cells in the joint regions, causing laminar inclination in a concentration-dependent manner (Takeno and Pharis, 1982; Cao and Chen, 1995). Changes in cell wall extensibility or loosening are essential for cell expansion (Campbell and Braam, 1999). Although the molecular mechanism for such action remains elusive, cell wall loosening enzymes including xyloglucan endotransglycosylase have been shown to be upregulated by BL and involved in this modification, resulting in laminar inclination in rice (Uozu et al., 2000). Thus, here we describe a procedure through which we could distinguish the BR sensitivity between the wild type and erect leafed osbul1 mutant plants through the rice lamina inclination assay.

Mosquito saliva plays an important role in establishing infection, facilitating dissemination, modulating immune responses, and exacerbating pathogenesis during West Nile virus (Schneider et al., 2006; Styer et al., 2011), Dengue virus (Cox et al., 2012; Conway et al., 2014; McCracken et al., 2014; Schmid et al., 2016), chikungunya virus (Agarwal et al., 2016), Semliki Forest virus (Pingen et al., 2016), Rift Valley Fever virus (Le Coupanec et al., 2013) and Plasmodium parasite (Schneider et al., 2011) infection.

Bio-protocol-2726	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2405	Assessing Plant Tolerance to Acute Heat Stress	Thermotolerance, Greening, Arabidopsis, Heat shock proteins Background It is well-established that plants are able to acclimate to temperatures above or below the optimal temperature for their growth, and many studies have identified genes necessary for, or associated with temperature acclimation. Typically, acclimation requires a period of exposure to a non-damaging temperature treatment, either above optimal to induce heat tolerance, or below optimal to induce cold or freezing tolerance. In Arabidopsis and other plants, freezing tolerance can be achieved within a period of ^24~h~ of cold treatment (cold hardening), with maximum freezing tolerance occurring after several days of hardening (Gilmour et al., 1988; Thomashow, 1999). Tolerance to normally lethal or damaging high temperatures can develop more rapidly, within a few hours. This type of rapid heat acclimation was extensively documented by Yarwood (1967) and others in the 1960s using a variety of plant species. Research on high temperature acclimation accelerated when it was recognized in the early 1980s that all organisms, including plants, responded to heat stress with a ‘heat shock response’ that involves transcription and translation of a conserved set of ‘heat shock proteins’ (Lindquist, 1986; Vierling, 1991). Work with soybean seedlings, similar to the earlier work of Yarwood, defined a simple assay for hypocotyl elongation that allowed investigation of the relationship of heat acclimation to the heat shock response (Lin et al., 1984). This assay was then extended to Arabidopsis and used to identify mutants altered in heat acclimation, in both forward and reverse genetic screens (Hong and Vierling, 2001; Larkindale et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2012). Other assays for heat acclimation were also developed and used for mutant screening in Arabidopsis, including heat acclimation of greening of dark grown seedlings (Burke et al., 2000) and seedling viability (Wu et al., 2013).
Bio-protocol-2727	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2404	Glioma Induction by Intracerebral Retrovirus Injection	Glioma, Retrovirus, Intracerebral injection, Murine model, PDGFBB, PTEN, P53 Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor and unfortunately is also almost always fatal. Despite advances in multiple therapeutic modalities, no effective therapy has been developed to cure GBM. The mechanisms underlying this disease remain poorly understood. Animal models have been a very important tool to define the GBM pathogenesis and test for gene or drug therapeutics. Several mouse models have been developed with the aim to produce a disease which mimics the human disease as closely as possible and exhibits similar molecular, genetic and histological character. The prominently used models are xenograft (Hingtgen et al., 2008) models where human tumor cell lines can be transplanted orthotopically in brain as well as ectopically in subcutaneous area in immunocompromised mice, providing an advantage of having a large tumor mass in a brief period. Genetically engineered mice models (GEMM) with specific gain-of oncogenic activities or loss of tumor suppressor pathways, which resemble perturbations in the most frequently dysregulated pathways in GBM, results in formation of gliomas in rodents. Genetic perturbations in GEMM models often include the gain-of-function mutations in oncogenic factors such as EGFR, PI-3K, and Ras (Holland et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2009), and PDGF amplification (Assanah et al., 2006), as well as the loss-of-function in tumor suppressors such as NF1 (Zhu et al., 2005), TP53 (p53) (Zheng et al., 2008), Ink4a/ARF (Holland, 2001), PTEN (Holland et al., 1998 and 2000). The use of viral vectors (Ikawa et al., 2003; Hambardzumyan et al., 2009; Marumoto et al., 2009; Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012) such as retrovirus, lentivirus and adenovirus carrying oncogenes and/or targeting tumor suppressors has been a convenient and effective approach to induce brain tumor formation in rodents. There is a need for testing multiple different tumor models for therapeutics since different subtypes of gliomas have varied genetic profiles and clinical responses to drug treatment.

PCC 6803	Cyanobacteria, Synechocystis, PHB, Nitrogen deprivation Background Non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 respond to the lack of combined nitrogen sources by bleaching, a process known as chlorosis (Allen and Smith, 1969). This acclimation response is characterized by four major structural and morphological changes: (i) a massive accumulation of electron-dense glycogen inclusions (approx. 40 nm in diameter) between the thylakoid layers accompanied by (ii) the degradation of the phycobilisome antenna complexes, (iii) the disassembling of the thylakoid membrane layers including a reduction by number and packing density, and (iv) the formation of distinct electron-transparent PHB granules (approx. 400-500 nm in diameter) (Damrow et al., 2016). The physiological function of cyanobacterial PHB metabolism, synthesized just in a few species, is quite opaque due to the absence of both catabolic enzymes and evident phenotype of PHB-deficient mutants (Beck et al., 2012; van der Woude et al., 2014; Damrow et al., 2016; Namakoshi et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2730	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2401	Ciberial Muscle 9 (CM9) Electrophysiological Recordings in Adult Drosophila melanogaster	Drosophila, Aging, Neuromuscular junction, Neurotransmission Background A significant hurdle in defining changes in presynaptic function during aging has been due to the lack of a simple model system for performing the electrophysiological recordings necessary to thoroughly characterize the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Existing rodent models suffer from the significant cost issues associated with aging studies and the technical difficulty of using electrophysiological recordings on single defined nerve terminals with consistent release parameters. To overcome these obstacles, we have pioneered a model synaptic system in the adult Drosophila for analyzing the effects of age on presynaptic function during neurotransmission, the CM9 NMJ located on the fly proboscis (Rawson et al., 2012; Mahoney et al., 2014; Mahoney et al., 2016) (Figure 4A). Briefly, the presynaptic arbor of the CM9 motor neuron (MN) converges upon the 15 muscle fibres of the CM9 muscle to form 35 individual distinct innervations (Rawson et al., 2012). The CM9 MN has been shown to be necessary for the contraction of the CM9 muscle and is the only source of glutamatergic input for the CM9 muscle (Kimura et al., 1986; Gordon and Scott, 2009). Given the highlyconserved nature of the mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle (SV) release between flies and mammals, and the resemblance to the central synapses found in the mammalian CNS, this makes the CM9 NMJ a powerful model for investigating presynaptic function.
Bio-protocol-2731	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2400	Aldicarb-induced Paralysis Assay to Determine Defects in	Aldicarb, C. elegans, Acetylcholinesterase, Synaptic transmission Background Synaptic transmission is initiated by arrival of action potential at presynaptic terminals, which in turn results in the release of neurotransmitters. The released neurotransmitters bind to and activate postsynaptic receptors (Sudhof, 2013). C. elegans locomotion is controlled by acetylcholinereleasing excitatory motor neurons and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-releasing-inhibitory motor neurons (Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999; Zhen and Samuel, 2015). Acetylcholine released from cholinergic motor neurons activates acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane, leading to muscle excitation and contraction. Acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and thus terminates neurotransmission. Aldicarb is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In the presence of aldicarb, acetylcholine continues to accumulate, causing persistent muscle contraction and eventual paralysis. Mutant animals with decreased levels of synaptic transmission are resistant to the paralyzing effect of aldicarb because acetylcholine more slowly accumulates in the synaptic cleft of these animals than that of wild type animals. Conversely, mutant animals with increased levels of synaptic transmission, and as a result, a faster accumulation of acetylcholine, are more sensitive to the paralyzing effect of aldicarb than wild-type animals (Rand, 2007). Thus, by comparing the time-course of aldicarb-induced paralysis, it is possible to infer the relative efficiency of synaptic transmission. However, it is necessary to note that this assay does not necessarily demonstrate that abnormal aldicarb sensitivity is a result of a presynaptic defect. For example, a defect in post-synaptic acetylcholine receptor function may also result in resistance to aldicarb (Loria et al., 2004). Thus, the aldicarb-induced paralysis assay should be considered as the first step in investigating the involvement of synaptic transmission, and further corroborated by other means, such as electrophysiological analysis (Richmond, 2006).

Viruses with icosahedral shapes have the viral coat proteins form a protective shell around the RNA genome (Stockley et al., 2013). In the phage MS2 and the plant-infecting Brome mosaic virus (BMV), the coat protein preferentially contacts specific RNA sequences (Ni et al., 2013; Hoover et al., 2016; Rolfsson et al., 2016). These contacts could regulate the timing of RNA release during infection, viral gene expression, and viral RNA replication (Hoover et al., 2016). Identification of the capsid-RNA interactions could thus provide insights into the regulations of viral infection and provide means to inhibit viral infection. With this in mind, we have developed a method to identify the capsid-RNA contacts in purified virions using a combination of UV crosslinking, RNA fragmentation, selective precipitation of the coat protein, and next-generation sequencing of the cDNAs made from RNA fragments. The protocol below was developed for BMV virions.

Bio-protocol-2740	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2391	Non-radioactive LATS in vitro Kinase Assay	LATS, Phosphorylation, in vitro kinase assay, Hippo pathway, YAP Background Large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) are protein kinases and core components of the Hippo pathway, which regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis. LATS kinase is activated by phosphorylation on its hydrophobic motif (HM, Thr 1079 for LATS1 and Thr 1041 for LATS2). As a result, Western blotting with phosphoantibody recognizing LATS at HM provides an indirect way to assess LATS kinase activity (Data analysis, Figure 1). In addition, active LATS phosphorylates and inhibits the transcription co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) at Ser 127, leading to YAP binding to 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic retention (Zhao et al., 2007). Using YAP as a substrate in LATS in vitro kinase assay provides a method to directly assess LATS kinase activity. Through this assay, we were able to show that serum starvation and sorbitol-induced osmotic activate LATS (Yu et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2017) and further lead to YAP Ser 127 phosphorylation (Data analysis, Figure 2).
Bio-protocol-2741	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2390	Non-invasive Protocol for Kinematic Monitoring of Root Growth under Infrared Light	Hydroponics, Infrared imaging, Kinematics, Root growth, Time-lapse Background The use of kinematic analyses for the monitoring of growth and tropisms in plants dates back to the end of the 19^th century, with early studies from Julius von Sachs and Whilhelm Pfeffer. The widespread use of photography during the 20^th century led to easier and continuous monitoring through ‘streak photography’ (List, 1969; Erickson and Silk, 1980). In the 90s, new digital cameras and informatics tools enabled the development of automatic tracking algorithms used for particle image velocimetry. RootFlowRT (Van der Weele et al., 2003), Kineroot (Basu et al., 2007), RootTrace (French et al., 2009), GrowthTracer (Iwamoto et al., 2013) and Kymorod (Bastien et al., 2016) are among many recent examples of software dedicated to the monitoring of root growth. However, all particle image velocimetry methods rely on the use of identifiable image texture patterns in each successive picture. Historically, these patterns were marked on the root using ink or graphite particles (see Sharp et al., 1988 and Merret et al., 2010 for examples). Two difficulties arise from this approach: Firstly, the markings spread during organ (root) growth, inducing loss of resolution after a few hours. Secondly, the physical marking process may stress the organ due to some combination of exposure to small forces, to light or to temperature changes, or to slight drying of the organ surface. In roots such handling effects may cause temporary slowing of growth for a period of minutes to hours. The use of infrared light (840-850 nm) has the double benefit of not influencing root growth, whilst also generating image texture patterns readily tracked using particle image velocimetry.
Bio-protocol-2742	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2389	Delayed-matching-to-place Task in a Dry Maze to Measure Spatial Working Memory in Mice Xi Feng1, 2, *, Karen Krukowski1, 2, Timothy Jopson1, 2 and Susanna Rosi1, 2, 3, 4, 5, *	DMP dry maze, Working memory, Behavior, Mouse Background The reference-memory water maze (RMW) was originally used to measure spatial reference memory in rats. In this task, animals are trained to find a hidden platform in a fixed location under opaque water by using distal clues outside of the water maze (Morris, 1981). Over the years it has evolved into various tasks that allow probe trials, over training, reverse learning and an on-demand platform (Morris et al., 1982; Morris et al., 1990; Spooner et al., 1994; Lipp and Wolfer, 1998). Later the Morris lab developed a delayed matching-to-place (DMP) water maze that requires frequently updated, ‘delayed’ memory of escape locations in an unchanging environment (Steele and Morris, 1999). These variations of Morris water maze (MWM) are widely used in the neuroscience field to study spatial cognitive functions that involve different brain regions in both rats and mice (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). The main concern for these tests is that forced swimming might induce stress for animals (Vorhees and Williams, 2014). To exclude this limitation, Faizi et al. (2012) designed a dry maze based on the principles of the DMP water maze. The DMP dry maze is believed to measure the same working/episodic-like memory as the DMP water maze with a less intense test paradigm for both the experimenter and test subjects.

Lateral root formation is affected by nutrients at different developmental stages (e.g., initiation versus elongation) and in a nutrient-specific manner (Li et al., 2011; Giehl et al., 2012). Iron toxicity as a syndrome in plants is typically associated with an excessive amount of the ferrous form (the Fe^2+ ion) in the soil (Vigani, 2012). Iron toxicity symptoms vary with cultivars and are characterized by a reddish-brown, purple bronzing, yellow, or orange discoloration of the lower leaves and a stunted root growth. The presence of the Fe^2+ ion is increased by low pH and anoxic conditions, and there is an increasing presence in vertically lower strata (Becker and Asch, 2005; Li et al., 2016). We describe a detailed pipeline used for localized iron supply in Arabidopsis grown in vitro which we validated in Arabidopsis (Li et al., 2015a; 2015b and 2016).
Bio-protocol-2745	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2386	In vitro Demonstration and Quantification of Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation	NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps), Neutrophil, Sytox orange, DNA/Histone H1 Background Neutrophils constitute the largest, evolutionary conserved fraction of circulating leukocytes. They set up the first defence line against pathogens by various mechanisms including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). During this process, activated neutrophils expel chromatin fibers from the nucleus. Invading pathogens are then trapped within the network of chromatin  and  killed  by  highly  concentrated,  NET-entangled  antimicrobial  proteins,  such  as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase (Brinkmann et al., 2004). However, NETs are a double-edged sword; the unrestrained NET formation from over-activated neutrophils can also contribute to severe tissue damage, for instance by the cytotoxic effect of histone components of NETs (Saffarzadeh et al., 2012). One example of a pathological condition in which neutrophils are over-activated and have enhanced capacity to form NETs is systemic lupus erythematosus. The levels of antibodies against double-stranded DNA as well as other components of NETs are elevated in sera of lupus patients (Knight and Kaplan, 2012; Yu and Su, 2013). Affected skin and kidneys from lupus patients are infiltrated  by  netting  neutrophils,  which  cause  endothelial  cell  damage,  a  critical  step  in  the pathogenesis of lupus and other neutrophil over-activation syndromes (Villanueva et al., 2011).

The system relies on the bacterial Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (Cas9), which can be directed by a short artificial single guide RNA molecule (sgRNA) towards a genomic DNA sequence (Jinek et al., 2012), where it creates a double strand break (DSB). These DSBs are then repaired by the innate DNA repair mechanism of the plant cell. Here, two main pathways can be distinguished (Salomon and Puchta, 1998). (i) DNA molecules with high homology to the DSB site can be used as repair template. This homology directed repair (HDR) approach can be exploited to introduce specific sequences at the site of the DSB (Schiml et al., 2014; Baltes and Voytas, 2015). However, due to low integration rates of these sequences, HDR mediated gene editing in plants remains challenging. (ii) An easier and more efficient approach is the use of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway of the plant, which is the dominant repair pathway in most plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Since NHEJ is error-prone, small insertions or deletions (indels) of a few base pairs (bp) occur often at the DSB site, leading to frameshift mutations and gene knockouts (Pacher and Puchta, 2016). Here, we provide a detailed protocol for targeted gene knockout in the model plant Arabidopsis including a simple 1-week cloning protocol for a plant vector system containing the Cas9 and sgRNA, and then Arabidopsis transformation and detection of mutations.
Bio-protocol-2748	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2383	Vaginal HSV-2 Infection and Tissue Analysis	Immunology, Vaginal infection, Mucosal immunology, Virus infection, in vivo model Background Vaginal infection with HSV-2 has been studied in various animal models, such as rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice and monkeys with viral replication at the peripheral site and retrograde transport of virus to the neurons (Nahmias et al., 1971; Overall et al., 1975; Renis, 1977; Stanberry et al., 1982; Roizman et al., 2013). There are several pros and cons regarding the different animal models in terms of susceptibility to infection, latency, spontaneous reactivation of HSV-2 and availability of animals, especially with regard to the accessibility of knockout animals, which have been very useful in studies of immune responses to infection. The vaginal epithelium in the genital tract undergoes significant hormonal changes during the menstrual cycles, and both susceptibility to HSV-2 and the nature of the induced immune responses are regulated and affected by sex hormones (Kaushic et al., 2011). Mice are more susceptible to vaginal HSV-2 infection during pregnancy and during the diestrus stage of the murine estrus cycle, when progesterone levels are the highest (Overall et al., 1975; Baker and Plotkin, 1978; Gallichan and Rosenthal, 1996). Pre-treatment of mice with Depo-Provera, a long-lasting commercial progesterone induces the diestrus stage and increases susceptibility to vaginal HSV-2 infection by 100-fold (Parr et al., 1994; Kaushic et al., 2003).

Almost everything within the cell–ions, molecules, complexes, organelles–is transported actively such that the local entropy is reduced. Although in recent years we have gained considerable understanding of the mechanisms underlying these transport process, most of our knowledge comes from in vitro and cell culture studies. In these simplified systems, it is difficult to establish whether the full potential of the transport regulatory processes is utilized. Tissues, organs, organoids and organisms, on the other hand, are often too complex to be studied efficiently with spatiotemporal resolution sufficient to match the scale of these transport processes. To combine the advantages of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, techniques have been developed that, while preserving complexity, make these processes more accessible. One example is the preparation of mass cytoplasmic extract from ambiphian (e.g., Xenopus laevis) oocytes and embryos to study cell divisions (Lohka and Masui, 1983; Murray, 1991; Sawin and Mitchison, 1991). We have recently shown that in cytoplasmic drops–i.e., non-purified cytoplasm directly extracted from the cell–released from single Drosophila embryos mitotic activity of the contained nuclei continues, allowing the probing of spindle properties by simple physical and chemical perturbations (Telley et al., 2012 and 2013). Here, we describe a similar ex vivo preparation technique based on ooplasm of developing Drosophila egg-chambers. This method allows the study of intracellular transport processes (squash assay), such as the transport of localizing oskar mRNPs (Gaspar et al., 2017).
Bio-protocol-2752	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2379	Determination of NO and CSF Levels Produced by Bacillus subtilis	Bacillus subtilis, Planktonic growth, Biofilm, NO, CSF Background NO is a key signalling molecule, playing a role in a variety of biological processes in vertebrates (Kerwin et al., 1995). C. elegans is unable to produce its own NO but is able to incorporate the NO produced by B. subtilis (Cabreiro and Gems, 2013; Gusarov et al., 2013; Kim, 2013; Clark and Hodgkin, 2014). Most organisms produce NO through aerobic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme NO synthetase encoded by the nos gene (Sudhamsu and Crane, 2009). E. coli strains, several of which are routinely used to feed worms (OP50, HB101) (Cabreiro and Gems, 2013; Kim, 2013; Clark and Hodgkin, 2014), are not proficient in aerobic NO production because they lack a functional copy of nos (Sudhamsu and Crane, 2009). However, E. coli can produce NO under anaerobic/microaerophilic conditions by a series of biochemical reactions associated with the anaerobic respiratory chain of the bacterium (Corker and Poole, 2003). In such case, E. coli might find permissive conditions for NO production in the oxygen-depleted environment of the worm intestine. Bacteria produced-NO in worm gut that freely diffuses through the plasma membrane is oxidized to nitrate and nitrite, and thus, the concentration of nitrate and nitrite are directly proportional to the level of NO production (Gusarov et al., 2013) and can be determined using a colorimetric assay.

However, there are some aspects of stroke that are not accessible to in vivo two-photon imaging. In regions experiencing more severe ischemia, cells swell due to ionic imbalance, and this edematous process contributes to increased light scattering, greatly reducing the quality and depth of in vivo two-photon imaging. A smaller zone of ischemia would reduce photon scattering, and still allow neurovascular changes associated with ischemia to be more clearly visualized over time in vivo.

Their large size, ample fusion events, structural similarity to vertebrate muscles, and amenability to powerful genetic techniques of the Drosophila system make the IFMs an attractive system to study muscle development. Historically, study of IFM development has been limited compared to embryonic muscle for several reasons. First, classic genetic approaches are difficult to implement in IFMs due to functional requirements earlier in development for many of the genes potentially involved in muscle development in the adult and to the syncytial nature of muscles, which restricts the usefulness of clonal analysis. Relatively recent advances in the available tools utilizing the GAL4-UAS system allow circumvention of these limitations, by expressing RNAi in a tissue specific manner. The power of this approach was demonstrated in a comprehensive screen for genes involved in pupal myogenesis (Schnorrer et al., 2010), and has been successfully implemented in several recent studies of myoblast fusion in IFMs (Mukherjee et al., 2011; Gildor et al., 2012; Dhanyasi et al., 2015; Segal et al., 2016). In addition, the technical challenges associated with dissection, accessibility, and visualization of IFMs have been overcome by advances in techniques and technology (Weitkunat and Schnorrer, 2014; Segal et al., 2016). This protocol is an expanded version of the methods used in the manuscript by (Segal et al., 2016), and is intended to contribute to the growing repertoire of techniques for study of IFMs. Here we describe methods for live imaging of IFMs, both in intact pupae, and in isolated IFMs ex-vivo. While previous work focused on stages of myotube growth via fusion (18-22 h after puparium formation APF,
Bio-protocol-2755	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2376	Bacterial Survival in Dictyostelium	Bacteria, Amoebae, Protozoa, Protists, Grazing, Digestion resistance Background Bacteria have evolved several different strategies to avoid or resist protozoan predation (Rønn et al., 2012). Mechanisms that reduce chance of ingestion such as increased cell size, aggregation, biofilm formation and increased swimming speed are well documented (Matz and Kjelleberg, 2005; Rønn et al., 2012) whereas mechanisms that allow bacteria to resist digestion in protozoan food vacuoles after ingestion are less studied (Gong et al., 2016). Here we describe a method to investigate the ability of bacterial strains to survive after ingestion by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We used this assay to investigate if copper resistant E. coli have higher chance of survival after ingestion than bacteria without copper resistance (Hao et al., 2016). We studied copper resistance because it is known that macrophages, which are phagocytotic cells with an important role in the immune system of vertebrates, use copper to kill bacteria in the phagosome (Hodgkinson and Petris, 2012). We hypothesized that this killing mechanism originally evolved in free-living protozoa long before multicellular life arose and hence copper resistance could be a factor that protects bacteria against protozoan predation.

Bio-protocol-2757	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2374	Formaldehyde Fixation of Extracellular Matrix Protein	Mesenchymal stem cells, Fibronectin, Vitronectin, Collagen IV, Formaldehyde, Fixation Background The components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin and collagens are often used for coating tissue culture vessels since they provide a more natural environment for primary cells in vitro and stimulate their proliferation (Sawada et al., 1987; Rajaraman et al., 2013). However, the observed stimulation of cell proliferation by these protein layers is usually fairly modest. This might be explained by their weak non-covalent association with the tissue culture plastic resulting in delamination and loss of immobilized protein molecules. Recently, it has been shown that the retention of ECM produced by the cells might be significantly increased by covalent immobilization of fibronectin to the plastic surface (Prewitz et al., 2013). However, ECM production is cumbersome and may be difficult to standardize. We have demonstrated that simple formaldehyde fixation under controlled conditions of layers formed by the selected individual ECM proteins can substantially enhance positive effects of these proteins on cell proliferation (Andreeva et al., 2016). Here we describe a detailed protocol of culture plastic coating and formaldehyde fixation for three individual components of ECM, namely fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen IV. Although we did not test the effects of controlled fixation with other protein constituents of the ECM, the positive results obtained with our protocol for three proteins of vastly differing molecular and biological properties provide sufficient reasons to assume the general applicability of the described procedure for enhancing proliferation stimulatory properties of a wider range of ECM proteins.
Bio-protocol-2758	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2373	Dense sgRNA Library Construction Using a Molecular Chipper Approach	Molecular chipper, sgRNA library, CRISPR-Cas9, Non-coding genome, Reporter screen Background Genome editing using Streptococcus pyogenes (sp) Cas9 and sgRNA libraries is a powerful tool to screen for functional genetic regulators in mammalian cells by generating biallelic lossof-function sequence alterations (Wiedenheft et al., 2012; Mali et al., 2013; Koike-Yusa et al., 2014; Shalem et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014). Cas9 binds sgRNA, which can be designed to target Cas9 toward a defined locus in the genome. The nuclease activity of Cas9 cuts target DNA locus, leading to double-stranded DNA breaks, which upon DNA repair through non-homologous endjoining pathway frequently results in short deletions at the locus of interest.

Bio-protocol-2760	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2371	Assaying Glycogen and Trehalose in Yeast	Glycogen, Trehalose, Yeast, Storage carbohydrate, Cell cycle Background Glycogen and trehalose are the two storage carbohydrates of yeast and many other organisms. In yeast, both these storage carbohydrates accumulate when the medium starts to be depleted and the rate of cell growth decreases. Methods for assaying storage carbohydrates in yeast date back at least to 1956 (Trevelyan and Harrison, 1956a and 1956b), and have been updated many times since (e.g., Becker, 1978; Quain, 1981; Schulze et al., 1995; Parrou and Francois, 1997; Plata et al., 2013, among others). There are three basic steps in assaying these two storage carbohydrates: first, lysing or permeabilizing the cells; second, freeing glucose from the glycogen or trehalose; and third, assaying the resulting glucose.

To determine whether the activation of Akt1 in endothelial cells is sufficient to drive de novo vascular tumor formation, we have developed and published a skin graft model of vascular tumor (Phung et al., 2015). We developed the current protocol of grafting skin from transgenic mice onto the skin of wild type mice because this is a way to study the localized and skin-specific effects of the overexpression of constitutively active Akt1 in the vasculature. We have observed that overexpression of Akt1 in the systemic vasculature leads to generalized edema in the lungs and skin, resulting in premature death of transgenic animals within days due to massive pulmonary edema. A procedure to graft transgenic skin onto wild type host mouse allows one to examine the long-term effects of Akt1 overexpression in only the transgenic skin vasculature without the lethality associated with systemic Akt1 overexpression. In our studies, we are particularly interested in investigating the long-term effects of Akt1 in the skin vasculature on the development of vascular tumors based on the hypothesis that hyperactivation of Akt1 in endothelial cells is sufficient to induce vascular tumor formation, thus demonstrating the endothelial cell-autonomous effects of Akt1 in these tumors.

Bio-protocol-2764	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2367	Qualitative and Quantitative Assay for Detection of Circulating	ELISA, Autoantigen, Autoantibody, Vasculitis, Serum, Autoimmune disease Background There are about 80-100 autoimmune diseases wherein immune cells recognize a selfprotein as a foreign antigen, and get activated to generate humoral response. Though the trigger for most autoimmune diseases remains a mystery, presence of higher levels of antibodies in the patient’s sera is very common (Wang et al., 2015). Some of the examples include antibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens in small vessel vasculitis, myelin basic protein in multiple sclerosis, glutamate decarboxylase in type 1 diabetes etc. (Wang et al., 2015). Limited knowledge of autoantigen in most autoimmune diseases presents a challenge for both the detection of disease as well as understanding the pathogenesis. However, ability to detect autoantibodies in the sera provides a diagnostic and prognostic advantage. Discovering a reliable autoantigen in autoimmune diseases are needed to make better clinical decisions. LVV is a spectrum of autoimmune diseases affecting aorta or its primary branch vessels. Like many others, its etiology and cure are not known (Buttgereit et al., 2016). We have developed a qualitative and quantitative assay to detect the presence of autoantibody in the human sera targeting against the human aortic antigen. Our assay provides a tool to find autoantigen in any affected/damaged tissue and in any disease model. We looked for the presence of autoantigen in the human thoracic aortic aneurysms using patients’ sera and tested the specificity of the assay by comparing the sera obtained from related subsets of autoimmune or non-immune diseases. We utilized discarded aortic tissues from aortic reconstruction surgeries and made soluble extracts of aorta to set up the assay (Figure 1). Using this method we performed a high throughput screen for detecting autoantibody in more than 100 sera against aortic antigen (Chakravarti et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-2766	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2365	Oxidative Stress Assays (arsenite and tBHP) in Caenorhabditis elegans	Hydrogen peroxide, ROS, Xenobiotics, SKN-1, DAF-16 Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are small molecules that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids and other cellular components. Systemic levels of ROS induce irreversible cellular damage, which has been implicated in the etiology of aging and age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Furthermore, environmental toxins such as pollutants, smoke, chemicals, radiation, and xenobiotics significantly induce ROS formation. To protect against oxidative damage, cells have evolved complex mechanisms that detoxify ROS. Interestingly, long-lived animals show an enhancement of these protective mechanisms, implicating their importance for healthy aging.

Bio-protocol-2768	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2363	Active Cdk5 Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay	Kinase assay, Cdk5, Western blot, Immunoblot, Radiation Background Although Cdk5 is typically associated with neuronal function, recent work has demonstrated that Cdk5 also regulates oligodendroglia progenitor cell (OPC) development (Tang et al., 1998; Miyamoto et al., 2007 and 2008). Cdk5 function is critical for OPC migration and differentiation, and loss of Cdk5 results in CNS hypomyelination (Miyamoto et al., 2007 and 2008; He et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013). However, molecular mechanisms that regulate Cdk5 function in neurons and OLs remain elusive. The activity of Cdk5 is controlled by the available amounts of two activator homologs, p35 and p39 (Tsai et al., 1994; Zheng et al., 1998; Humbert et al., 2000). The defects in embryonic brain development and perinatal lethality observed in mice lacking both p35 and p39 were nearly identical to defects in the Cdk5-null mice (Ohshima et al., 1996; Ko et al., 2001), indicating that p35 and p39 are the sole activators of Cdk5 in the brain. We uncovered that in contrast to the major role of p35 in activating Cdk5 in neurons, p39 is the primary Cdk5 activator in oligodendrocytes (OLs), where p35 expression  is  negligible.  Using  this  active  Cdk5  immunoprecipitation  and  kinase  assay,  we demonstrated that Cdk5 activity is almost completely ablated in OLs with siRNA-mediated p39 knockdown. Previous work established the differing sensitivity of p35 and p39 to high detergent and salt concentrations (Hisanaga and Saito, 2003; Sato et al., 2007; Yamada et al., 2007; Asada et al.,
Bio-protocol-2769	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2362	A Simple and Rapid Assay for Measuring Phytoalexin Pisatin, an Indicator of Plant Defense Response in Pea (Pisum sativum L.)	Pisatin, Phytoalexin, Nonhost resistance, Plant defense response, Pea Background Plants have host resistance and nonhost resistance depending upon the nature of plantpathogen interactions. Host resistance is mostly controlled by R genes and less durable, whereas nonhost resistance is generally a multi-gene trait and more durable in comparison with host resistance (Gill et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017). The pea plant has served as a model system for research on the signals that trigger the nonhost defense response when challenged by incompatible pathogens that fall outside that species’ host range (Hadwiger, 2008). An indicator of this response in peas is the induction of a secondary metabolism to the isoflavonoid, pisatin. Pisatin has strong antifungal properties but its presence is a valuable indicator of plant defense response. Pisatin can be quantitated in various ways from classical organic chemistry procedures (Schwochau and Hadwiger, 1969) to Mass-spec analysis (Seneviratne et al., 2015). However, a procedure with high reproducibility and simplicity is described herein that can easily handle large numbers of treatments. The targeted tissue is the inside layer of an immature pea pod, called endocarp. This pristine cuticle-free tissue is capable of responding rapidly to candidate microbes or elicitor compounds to generate the pea defense response. The exposed epidermal layer of cells can be monitored for light microscope-visible or stained cellular component changes. The overall changes that culminate in pisatin accumulations can be determined by immersing the pod half in 5~ml of hexane for 4h in the dark and subsequently allowing the decanted hexane to evaporate in the air flow of a hood. The residue remaining is dissolved in 1~ml of 95% alcohol and read at OD309 using a spectrophotometer: 1 O D_309=43.8~ug pisatin/ml in 1 cm pathlength (Cruickshank and Perrin, 1961; Perrin and Cruickshank, 1965; Teasdale et al., 1974). This reading minus the background control tissue and the characteristic UV spectrum are essentially free from other hexane soluble components of the pea tissue. This protocol was used in our recent publications (Hadwiger and Tanaka, 2014 and 2017; Tanaka and Hadwiger, 2017).
Bio-protocol-2770	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2361	Social Observation Task in a Linear Maze for Rats	Hippocampus, Place cell, Social observation, Local enhancement Background Social learning is defined as acquiring new knowledge through observing or interacting with others (Heyes and Galef, 1996; Bandura, 1997; Meltzoff et al., 2009). One form of social learning utilized by many species is the so-called ‘local enhancement’ (Heyes and Galef, 1996): an animal’s understanding of an environment is facilitated by the presence of other social subjects in the same environment.  Animals  achieve  local  enhancement  possibly  by  heightened  attention,  acquiring environmental attributes such as safety or food availability, or other unspecified means (Zajonc, 1965; Heyes and Galef, 1996; Zentall, 2006). The hypothesis predicts that the presence of social subjects in an environment impacts other animals’ neural processing of information related to the environment, therefore facilitate their understanding of the environment.
Bio-protocol-2771	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2360	Transplantation of Embryonic Cortical Tissue into Lesioned Adult Brain in Mice	Transplantation, Embryonic cortical tissue, Host, Adult brain, Graft Background Most neurons in adult brain are post mitotic cells and are not capable of regenerating new daughter cells, this results in a limited ability of self-repairing of adult brain after suffering from brain injury or diseases. Replacing the damaged brain tissue with embryonic neural graft is one of the potential effective therapies to repair the damaged neural pathways in the adult brain (Tuszynski, 2007). Much attention has been drawn to this field of study since the 1970s (Das and Altman, 1972; Bjorklund and Stenevi, 1979) and remarkable successes have been achieved during the last three decades. These studies have shown that neurons in grafted tissue can successfully survive in host brain and develop efferent projections to reestablish synaptic connections between the host and donor neurons (Gaillard and Roger, 2000; Gaillard et al., 2004; Gaillard, 2007; Gaillard et al., 2007; Falkner et al., 2016). Electrophysiological evidence suggests that the grafted neurons develop functional connections in the host cortices of adult animals (Gaillard and Domballe, 2008; Santos-Torres et al., 2009; Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2011) and the data of behavioral tests indicate that the damaged functions can be partially restored after transplantation (Plumet et al., 1993; Riolobos et al., 2001; Gaillard et al., 2007). Our recent study suggests that there is an interactive relationship between the host brain and the transplanted tissue. The transplanted tissue provides neurons to repair the damaged circuit, and host brain can restore the microglial population in the grafted tissue (Wang et al., 2016). However, the survival and differentiation of other essential cell subsets (such as astrocyte and oligodendrocyte) and their roles and functions in the grafted tissue remain undetermined. We hope the approach we described here can be combined with other cutting-edge techniques to reveal the mechanism underlying the reconstructing process between the host brain and transplanted tissue.

Bio-protocol-2775	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2356	Phototaxis Assay for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii	Phototaxis, Green algae, Flagella, Channelrhodopsin, Photoreception Background The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is used as a model organism in various research fields including phototaxis of microorganisms, photosynthesis, and ciliary/flagellar motility (Hegemann and Berthold, 2009). A Chlamydomonas cell perceives light at its eyespot, the photoreceptive organelle observed as an orange spot located near the cell equator. The eyespot contains the photoreceptor proteins channelrhodopsins localized in the cellular membrane and the carotenoid-rich granule layers right behind the channelrhodopsins which function as a light reflector. Because of their relative position, the eyespot undergoes highly directional photoreception, and the cell can accurately detect the direction of light illumination (Foster and Smyth, 1980; Ueki et al., 2016). Upon photoreception, two flagella change their beating balance, and the cell changes its swimming direction either toward or away from the light source.

To cover the divergent types of genes in the CuMMO superfamily, highly degenerate primers are inevitable, but previous strategies using highly degenerate primers have limitations when applied to environmental samples, like low PCR efficiency or non-specific amplification (Ledeker and De Long, 2013). We recently used a two-step PCR strategy with tagged highly degenerate primers, designated THDP-PCR, to amplify a wide range of genes in the CuMMO family with satisfactory PCR efficiency and no obvious amplification bias (Wang et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2783	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2348	Serial Immunoprecipitation of 3xFLAG/V5-tagged Yeast Proteins to Identify Specific Interactions with Chaperone Proteins	Immunoprecipitation, Yeast, FLAG tag, V5 tag, Protein complexes Background Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) is an unbiased method to identify protein-protein interactions with a specific bait protein of interest. While this approach has been fruitfully applied to identify protein interaction networks, it is plagued by false positives–proteins that appear to interact but are actually non-specifically bound to the beads or antibodies used in the affinity purification. In particular, highly abundant proteins such as ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes and chaperone proteins are common contaminants. However, sometimes these common contaminants may be bona fide interaction partners, yet it is challenging to demonstrate specificity. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a serial affinity purification approach to isolate specific, high affinity complexes between bait proteins of interest tagged with two affinity epitopes–the 3xFLAG and V5 tags (Figure 1). We have generated a plasmid containing the 3xFLAG-V5 epitopes and a HIS3 selectable marker that can be amplified and used to C-terminally tag any yeast protein of interest in a single yeast transformation (Zheng et al., 2016). We originally applied our method to demonstrate a specific interaction between the heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1) and the major Hsp70 chaperone proteins present in the yeast cytosol, Ssa1/2. However, this approach can be generally applied to identify high affinity complexes involving a protein of interest. While this technique removes the bulk of false positive interactions, a major caveat is that low affinity and transient interactions are likely to be lost.
Bio-protocol-2784	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2347	Estimation of Stomatal Aperture in Arabidopsis thaliana Using Silicone Rubber Imprints	Drought, Epidermis, Leaf development, Oxidative stress, Photorespiration, Stomatal density Background The epidermis of all leaves has specialized cells, the guard cells, surrounding microscopic pores. The guard cells and pores are called stomata, and they permit gas exchange and diffusion of water vapor between the atmosphere and the interior of the leaf. Stomata are products of an intracellular program, which generates the specific stomatal patterns during their development (Kagan et al., 1992). Stomata are found both in the abaxial and adaxial sides of the leaf, although the stomatal density (and starch accumulation) is higher on the abaxial side of the leaf sheath in Arabidopsis thaliana (Schlüler et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2009). The stomatal density is controlled by endogenous and exogenous factors in Arabidopsis thaliana (Berger and Altmann, 2000; von Groll et al., 2002). Stomatal aperture actively responds to changes in the environment and regulates leaf transpiration rates (Santelia and Lawson, 2016). An accurate estimation of the stomatal aperture provides insight into the impact of environmental stress on plants.

The more characteristic host-microbe interaction in nature is the symbiotic relationship between host and  intestinal  microbiota  (Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2011).  In  mammals,  host-microbe symbiotic interactions mainly occur along mucosal surfaces, with the most important one being the intestinal mucosa. When freshly isolated from the wild, C. elegans often harbours a diverse bacterial flora in its gut lumen, reminiscent of the microbial communities of higher organisms (Duveau and Felix, 2012; Bumbarger et al., 2013). By contrast, in the laboratory C. elegans is typically maintained in the presence of single bacterial strain  (Brenner, 1974). Most often, this is the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However, other species are sometimes used, such as the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (Garsin et al., 2003). An adult worm contains approximately 10,000 bacterial cells, a number 10-times greater than that of host worm somatic cells  (Portal-Celhay and Blaser, 2012): perhaps coincidentally, this microbiota-to-host cell ratio is similar to that found in humans.

Bio-protocol-2791	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2340	A Protocol for Production of Mutant Mice Using Chemically Synthesized crRNA/tracrRNA with Cas9 Nickase and FokI-dCas9	CRISPR/Cas9, crRNA/tracrRNA, nCas9, fCas9, Mutant mice Background  The  clustered  regularly  interspaced  short  palindromic  repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is an effective genome editing tool. In bacteria, CRISPR/Cas9 functions as an adaptive immune system. It consists of two small RNAs, CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activation crRNA (tracrRNA) and the Cas9 DNA nuclease, which digests targeted DNA (Jinek et al., 2013). Several groups have established the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a tool for introducing mutations in many cell types (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). When the Cas9 nuclease is targeted to genomic DNA, it cleaves DNA resulting in a lesion that is repaired by non-homologous joining (NHEJ) or homologous DNA recombination. Since NHEJ can be an error-prone mechanism, mutations can be introduced into the genome when DNA is repaired by this mechanism. The CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to edit the genomes of mice by microinjecting Cas9 and the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) into fertilized eggs. Although sgRNAs have been used extensively with success, the generation of the sgRNA is laborious because the sgRNA must be cloned from DNA oligomers and then transcribed in vitro. Systems that use crRNA and tracrRNA can eliminate much of the labor involved in preparing sgRNAs since crRNA and tracrRNA are small enough in length to be chemically synthesized. So instead of injecting Cas9 with sgRNA, mutant mice can be obtained by microinjecting Cas9 with both crRNA and tracrRNA (crRNA/tracrRNA). One drawback of using the CRISPR/Cas9, is guide RNA/Cas9 complex can generate off-target mutations, which are unintended mutations that occur at loci with similar sequences to the target sequence of the guide RNA. The risk of inducing off-target mutations can be reduced by incorporating the use of modified forms of Cas9, such as  the  nickase-type  of  Cas9  (nCas9)  and  the  FokI  domain-fused  catalytically-inactive  Cas9 (FokI-dCas9; fCas9). These Cas9 forms cleave target DNA only when two sgRNAs bind opposite strands with a limited distance between them (Ran et al., 2013; Hara et al., 2015). Recently, we successfully generated mutant mice by microinjecting modified Cas9s with chemically synthesized crRNA/tracrRNA into fertilized eggs (Terao et al., 2016). This protocol reduces time and labor for the preparation of targeting RNA and can reduce the risk of off-target effects.
Bio-protocol-2792	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2339	Targeted Nucleotide Substitution in Mammalian Cell by Target-AID	Genome editing, CRISPR/Cas9, Target-AID, Cytidine deaminase, Mammalian cell Background Insertion or deletion caused by DNA double strand break at the target site is efficiently induced to disrupt gene function. However, more precise genome modifications are still limited as homology directed repair is not always efficient enough in higher eukaryotes, especially when considering delivery of template DNA for in vivo genome editing. In addition, CRISPR nucleases also have some potential for off-target effect by cutting the genome (Cox et al., 2015). Target-AID demonstrated a very narrow range of targeted nucleotide modification without use of template DNA. AID can convert cytosine to uracil without DNA cleavage by deamination and then, uracil is converted to thymine or the other bases through DNA replication and/or repair. Use of uracil DNA-glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), which blocks removal of uracil in DNA and the subsequent repair pathway, rendered mutations more likely to be C to T substitutions and improved the efficiency. While a series of variable components for Target-AID had been tested such as linkage, nickase Cas9 (nCas9) and UGI in the original study, we will focus on the use of AID ortholog PmCDA1 derived from sea lamprey, fused to nCas9 or nCas9 plus UGI for simplicity. Consistent to our study, applying the rat apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (rAPOBEC1) has also been reported as a programmable base editor (BE). Although BE targeted 5 bases surrounding the -15 position upstream of PAM (Komor et al., 2016), Target-AID can modify 3 to 6 bases surrounding the -18 position upstream PAM. More recently, it has been reported that Target-AID can be applied for precise editing of plant genome (Shimatani et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2794	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2337	Contusion Spinal Cord Injury Rat Model	Spinal cord injury, Contusion, Rat, Demyelination Background The spinal cord plays an important role in the interconnections between the brain and peripheral nerves. Severe SCI causes the loss of physiological functions and even paralysis or death (Singh et al., 2014). After SCI, the microvascular hemorrhage with disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier is followed by edema, ischemia, and the release of cytotoxic chemicals from inflammatory pathways (Oyinbo, 2011; Mothe and Tator, 2012). Secondary neurodegenerative events such as demyelination, Wallerian degeneration and axonal dieback occur in the non-permissive tissue environment. Contusion, a type of blunt injury in the spinal cord, mimics typical SCI in humans which is mainly caused by vehicle accidents, especially motorcycles. In contrast to the sharp SCI model such as the transection that provides an anatomical model for evaluating axonal regeneration, the contused spinal cord presents a preferable microenvironment for studying of pathophysiological mechanisms post injury (Young, 2002). Experimental induction of a contusive SCI in a rat model using the NYU-MASCIS (New York University-Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study) impactor device has been validated as an analog to human SCI. Furthermore, a comparison between the rat model of SCI with human SCI shows functional electrophysiological and morphological evidence of similar patterns recorded in motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) as well as high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (Basso et al., 1996; Metz et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 2002; Young, 2002). Here we describe a method with tips for construction of an efficient and reproducible contusion model of SCI in adult rat.

However, neurons are often activated simultaneously either by flashes of light that activate the whole population synchronously or by a light whose intensity is temporally modulated over the whole field of view (Boyden et al., 2005). Yet, several methods exist to modulate the light spatially and have been used to uncage glutamate (Nawrot et al., 2009) or activate channelrhodopsin (ChR2) expressing neurons (Guo et al., 2009) (for review of available methods to stimulate neurons with both spatial and temporal resolution see Anselmi et al., 2015).
Bio-protocol-2797	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2334	Single Genome Sequencing of Expressed and Proviral HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and nef Genes	HIV-1, Single genome sequencing, SGS, Gene amplification, Nested PCR Background Over  thirty  years  ago,  HIV  infection  and  its  clinical  manifestation,  Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), emerged as a worldwide epidemic. Since then, significant understanding of HIV pathogenesis has occurred and the development of drug treatments now significantly extend patients’ lives. Current cART regimens encompass a variety of drugs that inhibit viral replication in several ways, which allows for the almost complete suppression of viral particles found in the blood and recovery of a healthy  D4^+ T-cell population (C D4^+) (Autran et al., 1997). However, the persistence of very low levels of HIV in plasma of cART treated patients, even those treated for decades, suggests the presence of a cell based ‘viral reservoir’. Viral reservoirs contain infected cells that do not release infectious virus (i.e., are latently infected), but can do so following activation, which may occur under a variety of conditions (Chun et al., 1995 and 1997). HIV latency is primarily attributed to proviral HIV DNA in resting memory C D4^+ T cells (Anderson et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2013), although recent reviews highlight a breadth of research into other potential reservoirs (Abbas et al., 2015; Kandathil et al., 2016; Rothenberger et al., 2016; Sacha and Ndhlovu, 2016). The resting memory D4^+ T cells can live for long periods of time, contribute to low-level persistent viremia during cART and viral rebound after treatment interruption, and produce viral variants with escape mutations (Chun et al., 1997; Finzi et al., 1997). Methods to determine the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and latency-reversing agents by measuring the circulating resting memory  C D4^+ T cells have been developed and evaluated (Ericksson et al., 2013; Crooks et al., 2015). However, it is pertinent to consider that less than 2% of the total body lymphocyte population resides in peripheral blood (Svincher et al., 2014), making the evaluation of HIV persistence of tissue-resident lymphocyte populations in anatomical reservoirs critically important.

A gap junction channel consists of two hemichannels (connexons) docked to each other. Each connexon is a hexameric assembly of protein subunits termed connexins (Cx) . The gap junction protein gene family consists of 20 members in mice and 21 in humans. Connexins are named according to their approximate molecular mass in kDa e.g., Cx43 has an approximate molecular mass of 43  k D a (for review see Söhl and Willecke, 2004). Different connexins are widely expressed in a variety of tissues throughout development where they mediate electrical as well as metabolic coupling. Furthermore, second messenger molecules and ions can be exchanged by direct diffusion through gap junctional channels.
Bio-protocol-2807	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2324	Induction and Quantification of Patulin Production in Penicillium Species	Penicillium expansum, Patulin induction, HPLC, Quantification Background Patulin is a polyketide lactone mycotoxin and is produced by several species of fungi including Penicillium, Aspergillus and other species. Among them, Penicillium expansum, which is a well-known postharvest pathogen causing decay of pomaceous fruits during storage, is the main producer. Patulin levels in apple products are of great concern because of the severe acute and chronic effects caused by the toxin. Therefore the patulin level in food is limited in many countries around the world. The European Commission (2006) has set maximum permitted levels in apple juices (50u/kappa) , solid apple products (25 u/kappa) and, above all, fruit-derived baby foods ( :10 u/kappa) , as children are major consumers of apple derived products.

Bio-protocol-2810	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2321	Generation of Mutant Pigs by Direct Pronuclear Microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 Plasmid Vectors	CRISPR/Cas9, GGTA1, Pronuclear microinjection Background Since the initial discovery of a highly conserved 29 base pairs (bp) sequence tandemly repeated with a spacing of 32 bp downstream of the iap gene in Escherichia coli genome (Ishino et al., 1987; Nakata et al., 1989), a family of short regularly spaced repeats, varying in size from 25 to 50 bp, were found in about 50% of bacteria and 90% of archaea (Makarova et al., 2015). According to their characteristic structures, the name clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were introduced by Mojica (Mojica et al., 2009) and Jansen (Jansen et al., 2002) and are currently in general use. A set of CRISPR associated genes, cas1 to cas4, was first identified flanking the CRISPR loci by nucleotide sequence alignments (Jansen et al., 2002). New members of cas genes were identified in different bacterial species. According to the cas members within each host, the CRISPR-Cas systems can be classified into three major types based on the hallmark genes (Makarova et al., 2011; Burmistrz and Pyrc, 2015). The function of the CRISPR-Cas system was demonstrated by a seminar experiment. After being challenged by virulent bacteriophages: phage 858 and phage 2,972, new repeat-spacer units were observed on the leading end of the CRISPR array in the surviving Streptococcus thermophlis host cells. The DNA sequences of newly acquired spacers were matched to corresponding fragments, named proto-spacers, in the phage genomes. Streptococcus thermophlis strains with phage spacer(s) were resistant to the phage infection, while strains without phage spacer(s) were sensitive to the phage infection (Barrangou et al., 2007). To distinguish between the spacer in the host bacterial genome and the proto-spacer, which has the same sequence as the spacer in the invader genome, a proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) was evolved (Mojica et al., 2009; Shah et al., 2013). The CRISPR-Cas immunity was revealed, it can be divided into three stages (Rath et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016). The first adaptation or acquisition stage is responsible for the acquisition of spacers into CRISPR array following the exposure to foreign mobile genetic elements, such as phages or plasmids. A Cas2 homodimer was sandwiched by two Cas1 homodimers forming a heterohexameric complex for all three types of CRISPR-Cas systems (Sternberg et al., 2016). In the second stage, the promoter embedded within the AT-rich leader sequence upstream of the CRISPR array transcribed the precursor CRISPR RNAs (pre-crRNAs), these were further processed into short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guides by Cas proteins. Cas6 was involved in the RNA processing step in both of the type I and type III CRISPR-Cas systems (Charpentier et al., 2015; Hochstrasser and Doudna, 2015). Accompanied by the Cas9 protein, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) which contains an anti-repeat segment for duplex formation with the repeat compartment of crRNA was involved in the maturation of the crRNAs in the type II system (Deltcheva et al., 2011). In the last interference stage, in cooperation with a mature crRNA and a cascade of Cas proteins, the signature proteins Cas3 and Cas10 were integrated into the RNA guided endonuclease complex in the type I and type III CRISPR-Cas systems, respectively. The type II effector is simply composed of a Cas9 protein, a pair of processed mature crRNA and tracrRNA (Gasiunas et al., 2012). The crRNA and tracrRNA in the ternary complex can be substituted by a fused crRNA-tracrRNA single-guide RNA (sgRNA) (Jinek et al., 2012). Because of extreme simplicity, the Cas9-sgRNA, now commonly termed as CRISPR/Cas9, binary complexes were immediately applied in the field of gene editing (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013).

However, immunolocalization of proteins has not been achieved efficiently in cyanobacteria. The most recurrent method to localize proteins is by fusing the protein of interest to a fluorescent protein such as GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) that has a different emission wavelength (compared with cyanobacterial autofluorescence), and subsequent visualization using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy (Flores et al., 2016; Santamaria-Gomez et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2818	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2313	Formation of Minimised Hairpin Template-transcribing	Dumbbell vector, Minimal vector, Small RNA expression, miRNA, shRNA, Genetic therapy Background With regard to delivery, a small vector size is advantageous improving extracellular transport including extravasation and diffusion through the extracellular matrix network as well as cellular uptake and nuclear diffusion. Various methods for dumbbell vector production have been developed over the time including methods for the generation of dumbbells expressing small RNAs such as small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (Schakowski et al., 2001; Taki et al. 2004). These vectors usually harbour redundant sequences as the expressed RNAs are self-complementary. We eliminated redundant sequences generating minimised dumbbell vectors in which transcription goes around the hairpin structure of the dumbbell itself (Jiang et al., 2016). Such minimised dumbbell vectors can be as short as 130 bp representing the smallest expression vectors ever reported. An illustrated comparison between a conventional plasmid, a dumbbell harbouring a linear expression cassette, and a novel hairpin template-transcribing dumbbell vector is shown in Figure 1. This novel protocol facilitates the production of the new minimised small RNA expression dumbbell vectors.
Bio-protocol-2819	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2312	Heavy Metal Stress Assay of Caenorhabditis elegans	Caenorhabditis elegans, Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper Background Some heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium and mercury, are known to be harmful to the majority of organisms including humans (Valko et al., 2005). To reduce the toxicity by these metals, the organisms have developed various protective systems. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used to understand the mechanisms of protection against heavy metals. Previous studies have revealed that many genes, such as detoxification enzymes, transcription factors and signaling factors, are involved in the protection from heavy metals in this organism (Broeks et al., 1996; Mizuno et al., 2004; Inoue et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2010). Determinations of viability and growth, in addition to measurements of reporter gene expression, are usually used to monitor the effects of heavy metals in C. elegans. In this protocol, we describe the methods for assays for arsenic, copper and cadmium using C. elegans.
Bio-protocol-2820	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2311	Intracaecal Orthotopic Colorectal Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model	Colorectal cancer, Orthotopic model, Cecum, Ascending colon, Nude mice Background Various murine models have been developed to facilitate studies of human cancers and allow better understanding of mechanisms contributing to tumor growth. While heterotopic xenograft models involve implanting cancer cells into the flank of immunocompromised mouse subcutaneously, orthotopic tumor models more closely resemble the original tumor development due to the implantation of tumor cells directly into the organ of origin (Richmond and Su, 2008). Although orthotopic xenograft models are technically challenging and labor-intensive, orthotopic transplants are able to more accurately mimic human tumor and better predict a patient’s response to chemotherapy in comparison with heterotopic transplants because of the effects of tumor microenvironment (Talmadge et al., 2007). With increased knowledge regarding the important role of tumor-host cell interaction during tumor progression, genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models using immunocompetent mice extend our ability to model the complexity of human cancers (Gopinathan and Tuveson, 2008; Zitvogel et al., 2016). However, GEM models are more expensive, often require months to a year to develop tumors, and have the drawbacks regarding the heterogeneity of tumor frequency, latency and growth. By contrast, xenografts are less expensive, require less time to establish tumors, and have better reproducibility (Vandamme, 2014). In this protocol, we describe the procedure of generating orthotopic colorectal cancer by injecting human cancer cells into immunocompromised mice (Tseng et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2015).

Origin activation follows a well-defined replication timing program that is controlled by checkpoint kinases and epigenetic modifications of chromatin (Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016). Replication forks frequently stall during a normal S phase. Fork arrest is caused by multiple events, such as DNA lesions, tightly bound protein complexes, and transcription at highly expressed genes (Tourriere and Pasero 2007; Zeman and Cimprich, 2013). Eukaryotes have developed different strategies to deal with this replication stress, including repair mechanisms to restart arrested forks and activation of dormant replication origins to rescue terminally-arrested forks.

There are methods available to detect GSH accurately however; due to readily oxidative conversion of GSH into GSSG most of the methods give an overestimate of GSSG. Cohen and Lyle (1966) solved the problem by using NEM to prevent oxidative conversion of GSH into GSSG and also preventing GSH to react with OPT during GSSG estimation (Figures 1 and 2). We have used this simple and reliable method to detect GSH and GSSG in our experimental system (microglial cell lysate). The main advantage of this protocol is that, it does not involve sophisticated instrument like high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which also needs sufficient expertise to handle as compared to plate reader which is more commonly available and easy to operate (Rahman et al., 2006).

IFN-γ has anti-pathogen, immuno-regulatory, and anti-tumor properties (Schroder et al., 2004) which promotes NK cell activity, increase in antigen presentation, activates inducible nitric oxide synthase, induces the production of IgG2a from activated plasma cells and promotes  T_h1 differentiation by up-regulating the transcription factor T-bet.

Bio-protocol-2831	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2300	Isolation and Infection of Drosophila Primary Hemocytes	Drosophila, Hemocytes, Infection, Phagocytosis, Phagosome maturation Background The experiment described below can be used to study phagosome biogenesis, maturation, and delivery to lysosomes. Bacterial accumulation has been well studied in the context of immuno-compromised Drosophila with defects in IMD or Toll signaling and the resulting reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides (e.g., Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007; Kleino and Silverman, 2014). Cellular responses to bacterial infections have been less investigated in Drosophila, with most studies focused on mutations that interfere with the initial phagocytic uptake of bacteria by hemocytes (Kocks et al., 2005; Parsons and Foley, 2016). Such bacterial uptake is straightforward to measure using FACS analysis (Tirouvanziam et al., 2004). For a detailed analysis of phagosomal maturation, however, we found it advantageous to examine individual hemocytes attached to a glass cover slip (Akbar et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2012; Akbar et al., 2016) as this procedure offered us the best combination of temporal and spatial resolution for our studies of phagosome maturation.

Bio-protocol-2833	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2298	Protein Isolation from Plasma Membrane, Digestion and Processing	Plasma membrane proteins, RapiGest SF, Trypsin, Strong cation exchange, Fractionation Background Plasma membrane (PM) proteins participate in diverse biological processes including signal  transduction,  ion  transport  and  membrane  trafficking,  and  are  the  first  responders  in cell-environment communication. They have a complicated composition varying from species, cell types and developmental stages (Alexandersson et al., 2008). Revealing their components and the expression features comprehensively with mass spectrometry (MS) is of great importance for developmental biology. However, their hydrophobic nature and the low abundance are a big challenge for the proteomic analysis (Wu and Yates, 2003). Additives like normal surfactants, organic solvents and urea are often used to improve PM proteins’ solubility, but they will reduce the proteases’ activities and create ion suppression during MS analysis (Zhang, 2015). RapiGest SF is a novel acid-labile anionic surfactant, which is structurally and functionally similar to SDS but does not inhibit the common endopeptidases activities at low concentration (0.1%W/v) . Thus RapiGest SF used in solubilizing PM proteins can not only facilitate their digestion by exposing cleavage sites but is also easily quenched by strong acid and removed through centrifugation so that the surfactant does not affect the MS identification (Yu et al., 2003). Peptides yield by the RapiGest SF-assisted digestion can directly undergo the strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation (Yang and Wang, 2017), so that the low abundance peptides can be detected by the MS.

Experimental procedures for chloroform treatment of mouse feces exist (Momose et al., 2009; Yano et al., 2015). However, they utilize specialized equipment including an anaerobic chamber. We realized that several brief exposures to oxygen occur during experimental manipulation of intestinal contents in preparation for and after chloroform treatment. Therefore, we reasoned the sufficient recover of murine sporeforming bacteria could be obtained without the use of an anaerobic chamber. Since spore-forming Clostridia are a dominant species in the mammalian intestine, this protocol could potentially be used for isolation of spores from the intestines of other mammalian organisms, including larger rodents, primates, and humans.
Bio-protocol-2836	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2295	Phos-tag Immunoblot Analysis for Detecting IRF5 Phosphorylation	IRF5, Phosphorylation, Innate immunity, TLR, SLE, Phos-tag, Immunoblot, SDS-PAGE Background In the TLR-MyD88 pathway, IRF5 is activated through post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, and then active IRF5 translocates into the nucleus and induces its target genes (Takaoka et al., 2005; Balkhi et al., 2008; Tamura et al., 2008; Hayden and Ghosh, 2014). Regarding the activation status of IRF5 in SLE, it has been reported that IRF5 accumulates in the nucleus in monocytes of SLE patients (Stone et al., 2012). Furthermore, we recently showed in an SLE murine model that IRF5 hyperactivation (e.g., elevated phosphorylation) leads to the development of an SLE-like disease (Ban et al., 2016). Therefore, analyzing the activation status of IRF5 is important for studying SLE as well as innate immune responses. Phosphorylation is central to the activation of IRF5, as numerous studies have revealed the functional phosphorylation sites of IRF5 by site-directed mutagenesis and/or mass spectrometry (Barnes et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Chang Foreman et al., 2012; Lopez-Pelaez et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014). However, antibodies specific for these phosphorylation sites are not commercially available. In addition, phosphorylated IRF5 is normally not separated from non-phosphorylated IRF5 using standard SDS-PAGE. We thus utilized the functional molecule Phos-tag, which binds specifically to the phosphate  group  via  metal  ions  (Kinoshita  et  al.,  2006).  Without  using  radioisotopes  or phospho-specific antibodies, this protocol enables the detection of multiple phosphorylations of the IRF5 protein as up-shifted bands in the resulting immunoblot analysis (Figure 1). This protocol can be applied for detecting the phosphorylation of other proteins if a specific antibody for the total protein of the target protein is available.

Bio-protocol-2839	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2292	Detection of ASC Oligomerization by Western Blotting	Inflammasome, Caspase-1, Pyroptosis, Biochemistry, Auto-inflammation Background Inflammasomes are large multiprotein platforms that sense a variety of microbial, endogenous and environmental stressors leading to the maturation of the pro-inflammatory IL-1 family of cytokines (Martinon et al., 2002; Sharma and Kanneganti, 2016). Upon activation, inflammasome sensors recruit the adaptor protein ASC through pyrin domain (PYD)-PYD homotypic interactions. ASC will in turn bind to caspase-1 via caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-CARD interactions and favor auto-proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1, leading to maturation of IL- 1 and IL-18 (Hoss et al., 2016). Inflammasome activation triggers supramolecular oligomerization of ASC dimers into large interweaving fibrils also termed ‘ASC-specks’ or ‘pyroptosome’ (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007). ASCspeck/pyroptosomes is a hallmark of inflammasome activation that correlates with caspase-1 cleavage and release of mature IL- 1 (Dick et al., 2016). Recently we showed that Nelfinavir, an HIV-protease inhibitor, promotes the release of self-DNA into the cytosol, activates the DNA sensing inflammasome AIM2 and subsequent ASC oligomerization (Di Micco et al., 2016). This protocol aims at detecting endogenous ASC oligomerization in immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) by Western blot analysis. It is adapted from the publication of Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (2007) that used this technique to detect ASC oligomerization in THP-1 cells.

Recent studies using mouse lung cancer models have proven that alveolar type II epithelial cells are a key cell of origin of adenoma/adenocarcinoma induced by chemical carcinogens and oncogenic mutations (Qu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015 and 2017). To further expand our understanding of the role of alveolar type II epithelial cells in lung pathogenesis in vivo, isolation of alveolar type II epithelial cells is needed to allow for a precise mechanism analysis in vitro. Based on previous studies (Corti et al., 1996; Rice et al., 2002), a modified method was used in our laboratory to isolate highly purified, viable and culturable alveolar type II epithelial cells from mice (Zhou et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2844	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2287	Murine Bronchoalveolar Lavage	Bronchoalveolar lavage, Lung cancer, Hema3-staining Background Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a simple and typical method commonly performed to diagnose pulmonary diseases including lung cancer (Daubeuf and Frossard, 2012). It is used to sample pulmonary components to determine the protein composition, immune cells and pathogens in the lung. Pulmonary chronic inflammation plays a critical role in lung cancer initiation and progression. To clarify the underlying mechanism of inflammation in lung tumorigenesis, a basic BAL protocol in mice is used in our laboratory to determine the pulmonary immune response (Qu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017).

Bio-protocol-2846	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2285	Nucleosome Positioning Assay	Chromatin, Nucleosome positioning, Micrococcal nuclease, LM-PCR Background Chromatin accessibility is regulated by nucleosome packaging, which therefore directs DNA-templated reactions such as transcription, DNA repair, recombination and replication. Dynamic positioning  of  nucleosomes  depends  on  DNA  sequence,  transcription  factor  binding,  histone modifications, histone variants and chromatin remodeling enzymes, and is used by cells to regulate genome activity (Bell et al., 2011; Hughes and Rando, 2014). The inaccessibility of nucleosomal DNA facilitates probing of nucleosome positions in cells by digesting nucleosome-free chromatin regions with nucleases like DNase I and MNase. These, and similar approaches are nowadays frequently combined with deep sequencing methods and provide thereby a genome-wide picture of nucleosome positioning (Tsompana and Buck, 2014). However, DNase-seq and MNase-seq assays are relative labor- and cost-intensive and might be immoderate for analysis of the nucleosomal architecture of a specific genomic region. In such a case, MNase digestion of chromatin followed by LM-PCR provides a simple and straightforward alternative, which allows interrogation of nucleosome positions at a given genomic site. Here we describe this gene-centric nucleosome positioning assay and demonstrate its application for analysis of the two nucleosome configurations at the mouse rRNA gene promoter (Li et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2016a and 2016b).
Bio-protocol-2847	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2284	Ultradeep Pyrosequencing of Hepatitis C Virus to Define Evolutionary Phenotypes	Ultradeep pyrosequencing, Virus, Quasispecies, Hypervariability Background Analysis of UDPS datasets derived from virus amplicons frequently relies on software tools that are not optimized for amplicon analysis, assume random incorporation of sequencing mutations and are focused on finding true sequences rather than false variants. These difficulties are further complicated by the presence of hypervariable regions present in RNA virus genomes. Many studies utilizing UDPS look to overcome these issues by applying arbitrary frequency cut offs to the data, resulting in the loss of minor variants. Here, a temporally matched clonal dataset, together with an error correction methodology designed to overcome the problems outlined, facilitated the retention of valuable sequence information.

Bio-protocol-2849	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2282	A Tactile-visual Conditional Discrimination Task for Testing Spatial Working Memory in Rats	Spatial working memory, Conditional discrimination, T-maze, Encoding, Retrieval Background Our laboratory is interested in exploring the neural mechanisms of working memory. Therefore, we have developed a task that can be used to assess spatial working memory (SWM) ability in rats. Working memory is defined as holding a limited amount of information ‘online’ so that the information can be used or manipulated to guide goal-directed behavior (Baddley, 1992). Because rodents are naturally inclined to forage for food, they are excellent models to use to probe SWM. Our laboratory has developed and used a conditional discrimination (CD) T-maze task in which floor inserts that vary in texture and color serve as conditional cues for the rewarded goal arm (Griffin et al., 2012; Hallock and Griffin, 2013; Hallock et al., 2013a; Shaw et  al., 2013; Hallock et al., 2016). For example, the rats learn to choose the left goal arm if they encounter a mesh insert and the right goal arm if they encounter a wooden insert. To discriminate between the inserts, rats can use visual information (black vs. light brown), tactile information (rough mesh vs. smooth wood), or a combination of both types of information. Because the insert covers the entire floor of the maze and is available when the rat makes a goal-arm choice, this task does not require SWM. More recently, we have developed a workingmemory variant of the task (CDWM; Hallock et al., 2013b; Urban et al., 2014). In this variant of the task, the floor insert cues extend only halfway up the central arm of the maze and are not available when the rat makes a goal-arm choice, thus requiring the rats to hold the cue in mind for a brief period of time in order to make a correct choice and receive food reward. In an ongoing experiment, we have found that it is possible to train rats on both variants of the task, giving us a powerful way to identify behavioral correlates of SWM while ruling out confounding sensorimotor variables such as visual, tactile, and selfmotion cues.

As is often the case, samples of cells or mRNA were not available from the individuals carrying these sequence variants, so we utilized the exon trapping method to serve as a functional test. DNA samples were available from patients for PCR amplification of the genomic regions of interest. If patient gDNA samples are unavailable, sequence variants can also be incorporated into wild-type sequence by methods such as PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis.
Bio-protocol-2851	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2280	Simple Spectroscopic Determination of Nitrate, Nitrite, and	Arabidopsis thaliana, Nitrate, Nitrite, Ammonium Background Determination of inorganic N content is important for predicting the ability of a plant to uptake and assimilate N. Researchers often use techniques requiring expensive equipment, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), for these measurements. The present protocol is based on versatile spectrometry with cheap reagents, making it practicable for many researchers. Nitration of salicylic acid by nitrate occurs under acidic conditions, and subsequent addition of an alkaline solution results in a yellow complex. Under acidic conditions, nitrite reacts with sulfanilamide to produce a diazonium compound that undergoes diazocoupling with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine to form a pink azo compound. Ammonium can be determined as a blue indophenol derivative under the catalytic influence of a nitroprusside salt. Each experimental procedure is easy, rapid, and simple.
Bio-protocol-2852	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2279	Muscle Histology Characterization Using H&E Staining and Muscle Fiber Type Classification Using Immunofluorescence Staining	Skeletal muscle, Myofiber type, Histology, H&E staining, Immunostaining Background Skeletal muscle is composed of myocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts and other cell types. Multinuclear myocytes, the main composition of skeletal muscle, are also called myofibers (muscle fibers). Investigation of muscle histology is a routine approach to study muscle function. Generally, the diameter of muscle fiber and the extent of adipocytes and fibrotic area are associated with muscle strength (Yue et al., 2016). In addition, the presence of central nucleated muscle fibers serves as a surrogate indicator of newly regenerated muscle fibers during muscle regeneration (Wang et al., 2017). Based on the differential metabolic traits and the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) subtypes, myofibers are classified into four types (I, IIa, IIx and IIb). The analysis of myofiber composition is helpful for studying muscle metabolic and contractile functions (Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011).

Bio-protocol-2857	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2274	Analysis of in vivo Interaction between RNA Binding Proteins and Their RNA Targets by UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) Method	CLIP, Protein-RNA interaction, Protein-RNA-immunoprecipitation, RNA processing Background While being transcribed in the nucleus, nascent RNAs are immediately assembled with trans-acting factors collectively named RNA binding proteins (RBPs). These factors interact directly with specific cis-acting regulatory sequences in RNA molecules, thus forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (Dreyfuss et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2015). These complexes control co-transcriptional RNA processing events as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in RNA metabolism, such as subcellular localization and translation. For instance, spliceosomal and cleavage/polyadenylation complex components recognize specific RNA elements in the pre-mRNA, permitting introns removal (Black, 2003) and coordination between acute3 -end processing and transcription termination (Proudfoot, 2016). A large number of RBPs functions as splicing factors, by assisting recognition of constitutively and alternatively spliced exons by the spliceosome (Chen and Manley, 2009) or by improving usage of alternative polyadenylation signals (Tian and Manley, 2016). Likewise, RBP-mediated recognition of zip code localization elements allows transport and local translation of mRNA in the cytoplasm (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009).
Bio-protocol-2858	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2273	In vitro Assays for Measuring Endothelial Permeability by	Endothelial permeability, Vascular leakage, Transwell Background The endothelial barrier is a well-regulated structure, which maintains a minimal and selective permeability to fluid and molecules under normal physiological conditions (Komarova and Malik, 2010). The disruption of the endothelial barrier occurs during exposure to inflammatory cytokines, pathogen infection, or cancer metastasis, which induces the disruption of cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction, or cell-to-matrix attachments. The increase in vascular permeability is an important feature in many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis, viral hemorrhagic fevers and cancers. To screen which molecules modulate vascular permeability, it is necessary to establish in vitro systems to test endothelial permeability before expanding to animal studies. There are two available systems to test endothelial permeability in vitro, transwell permeability assay and electrical impedance sensing devices (Bischoff  et  al.,  2016).  The  transwell  permeability  assays  directly  detect  the  penetration  of macromolecules and the electrical impedance sensing devices measure the cell layer’s tightness for ion flow. Basically, molecules which can be detected by a spectrometer-based absorbance reader can be used in the transwell permeability assay. As a result, the materials required for this assay are relatively easy to prepare. For the electrical impedance sensing assay, we used the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) systems to measuring endothelial permeability in a 96-well microplate. Compared to transwell permeability assay, electrical impedance sensing device is more sensitive, and is suitable for time-lapse tracking. However, it is also more expensive, and it may not accurately reflect the penetration of molecules through cell-cell junction. As a result, it is more accurate to apply both systems in parallel. Here, we show the protocol for using these two methods to measure the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro (Chen et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2859	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2272	CRISPR/Cas9 Editing of the Bacillus subtilis Genome	Genome editing, CRISPR, Cas9, Bacillus subtilis, Gene deletion, Point mutation Background Bacillus subtilis is a highly tractable, Gram-positive bacterium. It is amenable to genetic studies, using a variety of vectors to quickly and efficiently introduce mutations by homologous recombination. Although there are many different methods to introduce mutations in B. subtilis, each method has its limitations. A simple and straightforward method to make a mutation in B. subtilis is gene disruption, wherein a plasmid is integrated within a gene of interest (Vagner et al., 1998). The major limitations include: 1) the potential for polar effects by disrupting an operon; 2) introduction and retention of foreign DNA; 3) once an antibiotic resistance cassette is used, the researcher has to use a different cassette if a given mutation is to be studied in the context of other mutations; and 4) the method is limited to targeting an entire gene and cannot yield more precise point mutations. Another method employed in B. subtilis genetic studies is allelic replacement, wherein a gene of interest is replaced with an antibiotic resistance cassette (Guerout-Fleury et al., 1996). Although polar effects should be reduced by simply replacing one gene with another, this method still suffers from several limitations described above. Recently, a gene deletion library was constructed which allows for the removal of the antibiotic resistance cassette (strains are available from the Bacillus genetic stock center). As a result, researchers can use the same method for many mutations because the resistance cassette is removed after each allelic replacement. The method is an improvement, although it is still limited to gene deletions and cannot be used for point mutations. Finally, there are two methods to introduce markerless mutations in B . subtilis including point mutations. One method utilizes the upp gene as a counter-selectable marker (Fabret et al., 2002), and the other uses a plasmid called pMad (Arnaud et al., 2004) or its derivative pMiniMad which allows for mutation integration after removal of the integrating vector (Patrick and Kearns, 2008). Although these methods can introduce precise point mutations, our experience (making four gene deletions and inserting gfp at one genetic locus) using the latter method (Arnaud et al., 2004; Patrick and Kearns, 2008) is that it is quite time consuming with a success rate that is not very high (on average, about 12% success). Although we do not have experience with the upp counter selection method, the authors engineered a GGA arrow GAC change in the lexA gene and reported the intended change in sequence for three out of four screened isolates with the incorrect isolate yielding multiple mutations in the targeted lexA gene (Fabret et al., 2002). A major drawback, though, is that the method requires deletion of the endogenous upp gene in B. subtilis, which requires that the Δupp strain be used as the new ‘wild-type’ control. Therefore, although the methods described above work, we were in search of a genome editing method with a higher efficiency that also required less time at the bench. These criteria prompted us to adapt a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (Jiang et al., 2013) to B. subtilis (Burby and Simmons, 2017). CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to introduce a variety of mutations including gene deletions, fusions, and even point mutations (Sternberg and Doudna, 2015). Further, by constructing the editing system on a single broad host-range plasmid with a temperature sensitive origin of replication, all vector DNA introduced during the procedure can easily be removed. Success rates have proven to be much higher for point mutations and small, gene-sized deletions (often over 80% success, but 100% success is not atypical), reducing the number of isolates that need to be screened. Although this method solves many of the limitations of the contemporary methods, our CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system is limited by the requirement of a proto-spacer adjacent motif or PAM sequence (NGG in our system), and the requirement of two cloning steps. Nonetheless, the ability to make a variety of markerless mutations, coupled with the rapidity with which the mutations can be transferred to different genetic backgrounds still provides a significant improvement over current methods for genome editing in B. subtilis. The system we have developed may also be applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria with little or no manipulation of the DNA reagents described herein.
Bio-protocol-2860	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2271	Analysis of Replicative Intermediates of Adeno-associated Virus through Hirt Extraction and Southern Blotting	Adeno-associated virus, AAV, DNA replication, Replicative intermediates, Southern blot Background AAV DNA replication is carried out by a rolling hairpin mechanism in cells co-infected by AAV and helper viruses such as adenovirus or herpes virus (Ward, 2006). The AAV DNA consists of a 4.7~k b linear DNA molecule with inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that fold back to form T-shaped hairpin structures. The acute3 end hairpin serves as a primer for the replication of the AAV DNA. These hairpin structures are regenerated by the AAV Rep protein, allowing further rounds of replication (Im and Muzyczka, 1990). Both ^+ and - strands of the AAV DNA are packaged and are infectious (Rose et al., 1969). When replicating AAV DNA is analyzed, several replicative intermediates can be detected (Straus et al., 1976). The most abundant replicative intermediate is a linear monomeric duplex molecule, formed by one ^+ and one - strand of the AAV DNA, which is thought to be the immediate precursor of progeny single-stranded molecules that will be packaged in pre-formed capsids (Straus et al., 1976). Dimeric replicative intermediates are also common, and the AAV replication model is compatible with even larger replicative intermediates. The study of AAV replication benefitted from the discovery that AAV plasmids are infectious–the AAV DNA can be fully rescued from a plasmid (in the presence of helper virus) and its replication mimics that of the native virus (Samulski et al., 1982). The method detailed here allows the investigation of the DNA intermediates formed during DNA replication initiated from an AAV plasmid, and was used to compare different mutants of the AAV Rep protein for their ability to support AAV replication. The same method can be used to study other aspects of the

Invertebrate models have been used in seizures research for decades (Lee and Wu, 2002) however there were no protocols specifically investigating electroconvulsive seizures in C. elegans. In the past, multiple groups have developed methods of analyzing paralysis in response to chemical proconvulsants such as the GABAA receptor blockers, pentylentetrazol (PTZ) and picrotoxin (PTX), as well as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, aldicarb (Williams et al., 2004; Vashlishan et al., 2008). While these methods typically analyze the time to paralysis, our method quantifies the time it takes to recover from an electric shock-induced seizure (Risley et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2864	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2267	Adhesion and Invasion Assay Procedure Using Caco-2 Cells for Listeria monocytogenes	Adhesion assay, Invasion assay, Listeria, Caco-2 cells Background Listeria monocytogenes being a facultative intracellular bacterium can enter, survive and multiply in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and this property of the bacterium has been extensively studied and understood. Being a foodborne pathogen, it enters the blood stream in humans via intestines by crossing intestinal barriers. Thus human intestinal cells are used as an in vitro medium to study adhesion and intracellular survival of Listeria monocytogenes. Human colon adenocarcinoma cells, Caco-2 cells have been used extensively as a model for intestinal barrier (Angelis and Turco, 2011).The protocol described in this article explains the procedure to grow and maintain Caco-2 cells and then infect them to study adhesion and invasion properties of listerial species. This protocol can also be used with minor changes for cells like HT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells) and Tc7 cells (a subclone of the Caco-2 cell line have) which have also been used to study Listeria. These assays are generally used to compare the pathogenicity of listerial mutants with wide type(WT) strains (Reddy and Lawrence, 2014). Adhesion assay is straight forward wherein the bacteria are incubated with Caco2 cells for 30 m i n and the bacterial counts for mutants and WT strains are compared to observe any alteration in adhesion properties as a result of mutation. Bacterial counts obtained at different time points during invasion assay give more information about the survival of listeria in the human cells and the comparison of these counts between mutants and WT strains gives information about the changes in the adaptation of listeria after mutation in human cells. This protocol has been successfully used previously to study the adhesion and invasion properties of listerial strains (Jaradat and Bhunia, 2003; Lecuit, 2005; Sambuy et al., 2005; Reddy et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2865	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2266	Assay to Measure Interactions between Purified Drp1 and Synthetic Liposomes	Mitochondria, Organelle division, Dynamin superfamily, Phospholipids Background Interactions of proteins and membrane lipids are critical for the remodeling of biological membranes in cells such as organelle division. In mitochondrial division, Drp1 constricts the mitochondrial membranes and drives this membrane remodeling process. We have recently shown that a signaling phospholipid, phosphatidic acid, interacts with Drp1 and creates the priming step by restraining assembled division machinery on mitochondria (Adachi et al., 2016). Drp1 recognizes both the head group and acyl chains of phosphatidic acid. To analyze Drp1-phosphatidic acid binding, we set up several protein-lipid interaction assays, including a lipid dot blot assay, a competition assay and a liposome flotation assay. These assays allowed us to determine the function of the head group and acyl chain composition in protein-lipid interactions. In addition, we analyzed lipids under bilayer conditions in the liposome assay and lipids under non-bilayer conditions in dot blot and competition assays, which made it possible to examine the contribution of the membrane curvature and lipid packing to proteinlipid interactions. Below, we describe a liposome flotation assay that can be applied to many peripheral membrane proteins.

It causes significant socioeconomic impacts and has implications for international trade. The pathogen can also lead to serious health problems in human since it produces toxic secondary metabolites, including patulin, citrinin, and chaetoglobosins (Andersen et al., 2004). Control of decay caused by P. expansum has become important for ensuring the quality and safety of various fruits.

Several methods have been developed to isolate nuclei from different tissues and cell types. However, few nuclei isolation protocols from nematodes other than C. elegans have been described (Ooi et al., 2010; Zanin et al., 2011; Haenni et al., 2012). Embryos of the parasitic nematode Ascaris have been used to prepare a variety of extracts for in vitro cell-free systems (Cohen et al., 2004; Lall et al., 2004). However, these extracts were typically whole cell extracts. Here we describe a method for preparation of nuclei from the nematode Ascaris.
Bio-protocol-2870	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2261	Evaluation of Plasmid Stability by Negative Selection in Gram-negative Bacteria	Plasmid stability, ParE, Toxin, Negative selection, Gram-negative bacteria Background  Classically,  plasmid  stability  has  been  measured  by  positive  selection  using antibiotic-resistance plasmid derivatives. Cells harbouring the studied plasmid are positively selected in the presence of the selection antibiotic (Gerdes et al., 1985; del Solar et al., 1987). The main drawback of this technique is its sensitivity; highly stable plasmids are below the sensitivity of these assays. To solve this problem alternative methods relying on the direct selection of plasmid-free cells such as the tetAR-chlortetracycline system, have been described (Bochner et al., 1980; Maloy and Nunn, 1981; Garcia-Quintanilla et al., 2006). Limitations of the tetAR-chlortetracycline method include poor reproducibility and the frequent occurrence of false positives (Li et al., 2013). Here, we describe a novel, highly sensitive plasmid stability assay based on the counter-selection of plasmid-containing cells. This assay  is  based  on  a  cassette  containing  a  ParE  toxin-encoding  gene  controlled  by  a rhamnose-inducible promoter and a kanamycin resistance gene (aph) (Figure 1) (Maisonneuve et al., 2011). ParE is the toxin of the toxin-antitoxin system parDE, and targets the DNA gyrase, blocks DNA replication and induces DNA breaks leading to cell death (Jiang et al., 2002). The aph-parE cassette is inserted into the plasmid of interest using homologous recombination. Upon induction of P_p a r E in minimal media containing rhamnose as the only carbon source, only plasmid-free cells survive (Lobato-Marquez et al., 2016). Kanamycin is then used to confirm the loss of the plasmid (Figure 2).
Bio-protocol-2871	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2260	Haustorium Induction Assay of the Parasitic Plant Phtheirospermum japonicum	Parasitism, Parasitic plant, Orobanchaceae, Haustorium, Root, Host, Exudate, DMBQ Background Parasitic plants have evolved to obtain nutrients from other plants. Some of parasitic plants cause significant damage to agriculture by infecting commercial crops (Spallek et al., 2013). Obligate parasitic plants require hosts to complete their lifecycle, while facultative parasitic plants can survive without hosts as autotrophic organisms but shift to heterotrophic by infection if host plants are nearby (Westwood et al., 2010). The common characteristic of all parasitic plants is a specialized organ called haustorium, which connects parasite with host by establishing vascular bridges (Saucet and Shirasu, 2016; Yoshida et al., 2016). Obligate root parasites form terminal haustoria that are derived from enlarged root tips, while facultative root parasites form lateral haustoria, which develop at the lateral side of the parasite roots without affecting the root meristem. Therefore, several lateral haustoria can form in a root. The early stage of haustorium development is characterized by enlarged root tissues caused by a combination of cell expansion and cell division. Several host-derived substances that are able to induce haustorium formation in vitro were previously identified. Such substances are called haustorium-inducing factors (HIF). Among them, the most active HIF is DMBQ (2,6-Dimethoxy-1,4- benzoquinone), initially isolated from sorghum root extracts (Chang and Lynn, 1986). Phtheirospermum japonicum, a facultative parasitic plant in the Orobanchaceae, is an ideal model to study the molecular mechanisms of the parasitism, because of its short life cycle, small size, and simple genetics as a selfing plant (Ishida et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2016). In addition, genetic manipulation of P. japonicum is now feasible (Ishida et al., 2011) and its large-scale transcriptome information is also available (Ishida et al., 2016). Here we report an efficient in vitro method for haustorium induction to investigate functionality of haustorium-related genes in P. japonicum. This method presents a step-by-step protocol for haustorium induction in vitro by DMBQ treatment or by contact with host exudates. This technique is useful to understand the genetic factors that trigger haustorium formation in parasitic plants.

The ubiquitin moiety is split into two halves, and the N-terminal half is mutated (NubG) to avoid reassembly. The C-terminal half of the ubiquitin moiety (Cub) is linked with the transcription reporter complex PLV (Protein A-LexA-VP16). The fusion of two proteins (X and Y) to NubG and CubPLV, respectively, yields a system for protein-protein interaction analysis. After transformation, the yeast strain THY.AP5 contains the NubG-X fusion protein, while yeast strain THY.AP4 contains the Y-CubPLV fusion protein. After mating, in the diploid yeast, if proteins X and Y interact with each other, a functional ubiquitin will be reassembled which leads to cleavage of the PLV. The released transcription protein complex PLV switches on reporter genes (ADE2, HIS3) and allows yeast growth on selective media.

Inside-out, everted membrane vesicles allowed to explore effects of different substrates, inhibitors and other ligands on the operation of these enzymes. Functioning proton pumps, such as NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase Type 1 (Complex I), quinol oxidase, and ATPase also requires good electrical sealing of the vesicles.

MiRNAs typically control the gene expression by binding to complementary sequence in their target mRNAs. Many bioinformatics and computational programs are available to predict miRNA targets.

In particularly, rodent models have been frequently used because they are highly reproducible and exhibit pain hypersensitivity that is also observed in patients with neuropathic pain. In this protocol, we describe how to prepare the mouse spinal nerve injury model.
Bio-protocol-2880	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2251	Olfactory Cued Learning Paradigm	Olfactory, Circuit, Learning, Synaptic, Plasticity, Go/No-Go, Behavior Background The adult brain features ongoing experience-dependent structural changes. Within the rodent olfactory bulb (OB) where odor information is first processed, a continuous supply of adult born interneurons  (granule  cells)  either  integrates  into  the  olfactory  circuitry  or  undergoes apoptosis (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002; Carleton et al., 2003; Lledo et al., 2006; Sakamoto et al., 2014). This choice between survival or death is greatly influenced by sensory stimulus and olfactory cued learning (Rochefort et al., 2002; Alonso et al., 2006). Moreover, younger granule cells also undergo experience-dependent synaptic changes within a critical time window (Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005). To examine how sensory experience affects synaptic plasticity in OB circuits, our lab has successfully implemented a Go/No-Go olfactory cued learning task (Huang et al., 2016; Quast et al., 2016). Mice are trained to associate a ‘Go Odor’ with a water reward and a separate ‘No-Go Odor’ with a punishment (trial timeout) (Figure 1). Upon completion of training, mice will be able to distinguish the two odors by performing the associated task with greater than 85% accuracy (Supplemental Video 1).

Multiple molecular components contribute to the interactions but are still poorly understood. Various growth factors are needed to attract endothelial cells to sites of low oxygen concentrations and build new vessels that are then covered by perivascular cells. Both cell types interact to secrete a specialized extracellular matrix and stabilize the newly formed vessels. In the past multiple assays have been established to analyze vascular cell interaction and vessel-like network formation on two-dimensional matrigel substrates, but those are limited in providing information about initial steps of endothelial-perivascular cell interaction and vascular basement membrane formation in a three-dimensional microenvironment. In addition, well characterized perivascular cell suitable for culture experiments were missing.
Bio-protocol-2885	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2246	Virtual Screening of Transmembrane Serine Protease Inhibitors	Molecular modeling, Small-molecules, Molecular docking, Cancer, Drug discovery Background Controlled proteolytic activity plays a fundamental role in cellular processes and signaling, as evidenced by the presence of proteases in all organisms, including viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Not surprisingly, aberrantly regulated protease activity is causal to wide variety of human pathologies such as cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis, neurological disorders and cancer (Turk, 2006; Bachovchin and Cravatt, 2012). In particular, development of primary cancer and metastatic capacity has been linked to several different classes of proteases including matrix metalloproteinases  (MMPs),  cysteine  proteases  (cathepsins)  and  membrane-associated  serine proteases (Lopez-Otin and Matrisian, 2007). Recent clinical, genetic and functional data, suggesting a critical role for membrane-associated serine proteases in solid cancers, including cancer of prostate, ovarian and breast, have prompted new interest in the development of small molecule serine protease inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. Hepsin is a type II transmembrane serine protease and an attractive target for serine protease drug development due to frequent hepsin overexpression in common solid cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer, confinement of its overexpression on the membranes

Bio-protocol-2887	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2244	Physical Removal of the Midbody Remnant from Polarised Epithelial Cells Using Take-Up by Suction Pressure (TUSP)	Epithelial cells, Midbody remnant, Primary cilium, Suction pressure, Patch-clamp equipment Background The midbody or the Flemming body is the central part of the intercellular bridge formed between daughter cells during the final stages of mitosis. The abscission on either side of the bridge by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, results in the physical separation of the two daughter cells (Green et al., 2012). In addition to its known function in the regulation of mitosis, recent studies have begun to elucidate post-mitotic roles for the midbody. Due to its role in the initiation of lumen formation in kidney cells, the midbody has been postulated to serve as a polarity cue (Li et al., 2014). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the midbody remnant is directly involved in primary ciliogenesis by polarised Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Bernabé-Rubio et al., 2016). It has been also found to have a role in formation of the dorsoventral axis during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans (Singh and Pohl, 2014), and in defining cell fate and differentiation (Kuo et al., 2011). Previous studies have used laser ablation to impair the function of the midbody remnant. When performed in cultured cell lines, however, laser ablation can result in cell death due to damage of the plasma membrane and proximal cytosolic elements. Accordingly, we have designed a gentle procedure, which we have called ‘take-up by suction pressure’ (TUSP). TUSP allows non-deleterious midbody remnant removal from the cell surface of epithelial cells. The fundamental principle is based on using a fine-aperture glass pipette attached to patch-clamp apparatus to physically remove the midbody with applied negative pressure (Figure 1).

To quantify the resistance/susceptibility of different plants against Cuscuta infections the simplest way is to measure the gain of biomass of Cuscuta growing on a plant of interest. This is a reliable method since Cuscuta is a holoparasite and its gain of biomass is completely depending on its ability to successfully infect another plant. Thus, unsuccessful infection of a plant leads to a decrease in biomass and subsequently the death of the parasite Cuscuta.

The generation and characterization of lentiviral barcode libraries, the importance of library complexity as well as the associated analytical challenges have been carefully reviewed (Bystrykh et al., 2014; Naik et al., 2014; Bystrykh and Belderbosv, 2016) and need to be considered before starting this protocol to ensure proper experimental design. The current protocol pertains our adaptation of the technology as seen in our recent article (Kristiansen et al., 2016), to trace the long-term reconstitution capacity of FL derived HSPCs.

This system permitted us to express the tagged EXOSC10 protein at a level comparable to the endogenous WT protein, and to explore exosome purification protocols using a magnetic anti-FLAG affinity medium and protein extracts derived from cryomilled cell powder (Domanski et al., 2012). Building on this, we developed protocols for further purifying RNA exosomes by rate-zonal centrifugation, using glycerol density gradients, and assaying their ribonuclease (RNase) activity (Domanski et al., 2016). EXOSC10-containing exosome fractions exhibited apparent exoribonucleolytic activity, consistent with distributive 3^-5^ hydrolysis; the same assay permitted the detection and monitoring of the processive RNase activity of affinity purified DIS3-3xFLAG (Wasmuth and Lima, 2012 and references therein). The protocol presented here describes the RNase assay. Although this protocol presumes glycerol gradient purified EXOSC10- 3xFLAG-containing exosomes as the point of entry into the assay (Domanski and LaCava, 2017), the method should be applicable to any sufficiently pure and concentrated samples.

Bio-protocol-2894	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2237	Evaluation of Muscle Performance in Mice by Treadmill Exhaustion	Exhaustion test, Grip strength, Mice, Muscle, Treadmill Background Muscle diseases usually lead to alterations in skeletal muscle function. Non-invasive in vivo tests that can evaluate muscle performance are therefore of considerable value as primary phenotypic screening. Here, we describe how to perform the treadmill exhaustion test, which evaluates exercise capacity and endurance, and the limb grip strength assay, which measures muscular strength. In the treadmill exhaustion test, the mice are forced to run to exhaustion over a conveyor belt with gradually increasing speed. The limb grip strength assay uses a horizontal grip–that is grasped by the mouse–to measure the maximum force that is required to make the mouse release it. These tests can be easily customized to evaluate muscle performance under different situations, such as after therapeutic interventions or regeneration (Benchaouir et al., 2007; Puzzo et al., 2016), or to study the potential roles of specific genes on muscle physiopathology (Waning et al., 2015; Bi et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2895	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2236	Reversible Cryo-arrests of Living Cells to Pause Molecular Movements for High-resolution Imaging	Cryo-arrest, Fixation, Superresolution, Single molecule localization, FLIM Background Understanding molecular processes in cells, e.g., the ligand-induced response of receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs), requires the precise spatio-temporal observation of molecular patterns. Due to variance in cellular states, this response needs to be monitored in individual cells rather than in cell populations (Snijder and Pelkmans, 2011). Using SMLM, individual molecules can be localized with high precision (Betzig et al., 2006). This allows, for instance, extracting information about the clustering of RTKs in the plasma membrane. Complementarily, confocal FLIM can unveil how molecules react as an ensemble within a diffraction-limited volume element. This can reveal interaction patterns of RTKs with downstream molecules, phosphorylation patterns as well as activity patterns by the use of conformational sensors (Offterdinger et al., 2004; Sabet et al., 2015). However, the acquisition time in FLIM and SMLM is in the order of minutes. Because many molecular arrangements in living cells–including those of RTKs–evolve on a much faster time scale, confocal FLIM images get blurred and spatial resolution is reduced severely (Masip et al., 2016). In SMLM, molecules are localized successively in consecutive frames. Performing these measurements on dynamic molecules in living cells will lead to a falsified image of localizations since molecules diffuse to different positions in the course of data acquisition. For instance, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) moves on average with a diffusion constant of 2.5 10^-2 um^2/ s e c in the 2D environment of the membrane (Orr et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2008). To allow for long acquisition times, irreversible chemical fixation with aldehydes is typically used. Yet, the use of chemical fixation agents is inefficient in immobilizing membranes and can lead to protein extraction or artificial clustering (Saffarian et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2010; Schnell et al., 2012). Further, the lethal fixation disrupts the out-of-equilibrium physiological state and prohibits the observation of the evolution of molecular patterns within an individual cell. We have therefore developed a reversible cryo-arrest that halts molecular movements for high-resolution imaging, yet maintains cells in a viable state. Upon cooling, the concentration of cryoprotective dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is increased stepwise (Masip et al., 2016). This precludes the formation of ice crystals that can be lethal to cells while scattering light and altering cellular structure by displacing organic material (Dubochet et al., 1988 and 2012; Huebinger et al., 2016). At the same time, adding DMSO at low temperatures greatly reduces its toxicity (Farrant, 1965). A further advantage of the cryo-approach is that fluorophores become less reactive in the excited state, resulting in the emission of more photons before bleaching as well as a lowered production of cytotoxic radicals (Kaufmann et al., 2014), which can severely damage cells during acquisition at physiological temperatures (Wäldchen et al., 2015).

Bio-protocol-2898	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2233	Melanoma Stem Cell Sphere Formation Assay	Melanoma, Cancer stem cells, Melanospheres, Self-renewal, Stem cell medium Background Cancer stem cells (CSCs) were first found in acute myeloma leukemia (Lapidot et al., 1994) and then were identified in many solid tumors including melanoma. CSCs are defined as cells strongly endowed with self-renewal and tumor initiating capacity, being able to regenerate the whole tumor heterogeneity in vivo. CSCs can be isolated from the tumor mass with different approaches based on phenotypic characteristic or biological properties, then their properties have to be tested in vitro (selfrenewal) and in vivo (tumorigenic potential). Melanoma CSCs were isolated using a combination of cell surface markers, (Fang et al., 2005; Monzani et al., 2007; Schatton et al., 2008; Boiko et al., 2010; Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2010) or through culture in specific stem cell media (Perego et al., 2010; Santini et al., 2012). To validate melanoma CSC self-renewal, and to study the effect of tumor microenvironmental factors on it (Tuccitto et al., 2016), we used the sphere formation assay (SFA) in vitro. Melanoma CSCs are plated at low density in stem cell culture medium and they grow in anchorageindependent, three-dimensional spherical structures, called melanospheres (tumorspheres, in general). Spheres forming efficiency is directly proportional to the number of melanoma CSCs present in the culture (one CSC corresponds to one melanosphere), thus giving a direct quantification of CSC amount in culture. This relatively simple method is useful to study the ability of any exogenous factors (growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, drugs) in perturbing CSC self-renewal (Tsuyada et al., 2012; Tuccitto et al., 2016). Here we provide detailed information about the SFA protocol we optimized in our laboratory for melanoma SFA.

Bio-protocol-2900	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2231	The Object Context-place-location Paradigm for Testing Spatial Memory in Mice	Space, Novelty preference, Discrimination memory, Recognition memory, Context Background The behavioral neuroscientist’s toolkit of laboratory rodent behaviors has needed to expand to both propel and keep up with the progress of the program to identify the molecular mechanisms of memory. The traditional approach has been to use reinforced behaviors to control learning and formation of memory and limit behavior to readily quantified endpoint measures. However, to meet the growing sophistication of the learning and memory field and to test the generality of the postulated mechanisms, the toolkit has needed to expand to multiple estimates of memory. It has been especially important to use memory assays that minimize the need for behavioral shaping (a form of learning itself) and the manipulation of other motivational factors, many of which potentially elicit stress and other potential confounds of the molecular basis of memory (Lesburguères et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2904	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2227	Rapid Isolation of Total Protein from Arabidopsis Pollen	Arabidopsis thaliana, Flower, Pollen, Protein isolation, Western blot Background Pollen is a critical stage during the life cycle of sexually-reproducing plants. Pollen germination and subsequent tube growth provide the passage for two non-motile sperm cells to effect double fertilization in flowering plants. Pollen is routinely used as a model system to addressing fundamental cell biological questions, such as the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and polar cell growth, as well as the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton (Chen et al., 2009; Qu et al., 2015). Generally, pollen derived from lily and tobacco was widely used due to the large size of the grains, which makes them easy to collect and observe under the microscope. In contrast, Arabidopsis pollen is small and it is relatively difficult to collect a large amount of pollen to isolate a sufficient quantity of protein for downstream analyses such as Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Therefore, development of a protocol to rapidly isolate total protein from Arabidopsis pollen will facilitate related analyses.

Using epidermal fragments from the kidney-shaped guard cells (found mainly in dicots), the blue lightinduced stomatal opening can be observed readily under a microscope. However, direct measurement of the stomatal aperture from the dumbbell-shaped guard cells in monocots, such as rice, maize, wheat, and oats, is very difficult, due to their uneven leaf surface. Thus, a gas-exchange system is useful for the measurement of blue light-induced stomatal opening in the leaves of monocots.

The binding constant can be established using a variety of techniques, such as isothermal calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). An alternative method is based on thermophoresis, a phenomenon where distinct molecules (such as a protein-protein complex versus individual proteins) respond differently to a temperature gradient (Duhr and Braun, 2006; Seidel et al., 2013). This method is rapid, no sample immobilisation is needed and the sample requirement is low. Briefly, one of the proteins is labelled with a fluorescent dye and kept at a constant, low concentration. A dilution series is set up, where the other protein is diluted up to 16 times, creating a vast concentration range. The two proteins are subsequently mixed and loaded into capillaries, which are scanned in the MonolithTM NT.115 instrument, developed and sold exclusively by NanoTemper. The samples are subjected to a temperature gradient, and the movement of the fluorescently labelled molecule is tracked. The difference in the fluorescence of the molecule at the initial temperature and at the new temperature is used to generate a binding curve as a function of the concentration of the unlabelled protein.

Bio-protocol-2911	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2220	Screening for Novel Endogenous Inflammatory Stimuli Using the Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase NF- nablaKB Reporter Assay	Innate immunity, TLR4, Tenascin-C, LPS, THP1-BlueTM cells, NF-κB reporter Background The immune system has evolved to recognize not only pathogenic stimuli such as bacterial components and viral nucleic acids, but also endogenous danger signals including proteins secreted from necrotic cells or expressed upon tissue damage. Both types of stimuli are sensed by pattern recognition receptors, initiating signalling cascades that trigger inflammatory responses. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is a transcription factor essential for the activation of the immune response to infection and tissue damage. NF- K B has an important role in the expression of a wide range of inflammatory mediators following pattern recognition receptor activation, including cytokines (such as tumour necrosis factor α TNFα, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1), chemokines (e.g., interleukin-8 or CXCL1), proteases, growth factors and MHC-related molecules, among others. To assess the activation of this pathway downstream of TLR4, we used the commercially available cell line THP1-BlueTM NF-κB (Invivogen). These cells are stably transfected with a construct containing a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene induced by the NF-κB transcription factor. The construct contains an interferon-  minimal promoter fused to five copies of the NF- kappa B consensus transcriptional response element and three copies of the c-Rel binding site, which drives the expression of the reporter gene. After cell stimulation with pathogenic or endogenous stimuli, NF-κB activation leads to the secretion of SEAP, which is then quantified using the colorimetric reagent QUANTI-BlueTM. This is a quick and reliable method to assess activation of NF- kappaB downstream of tolllike receptors, as the amount of SEAP in the media correlates with the triggering of this signalling pathway. However, this is an engineered cell line that does not express a full complement of inflammatory effector molecules (see Note 5), and so whilst useful in screening for NF- kappa B activation, data should always be confirmed in additional experimental systems, for example in primary macrophages, or in vivo.

Bio-protocol-2913	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2218	Assessment of Murine Retinal Function by Electroretinography	Electroretinogram (ERG), Mice, Retinal degeneration, Photoreceptors Background Electroretinograms (ERGs) are used by researchers and clinicians to test retinal function by measuring the electrical response of retinal cells to a light stimulus. The ERG is a useful tool for measuring retinal responses in mice due to its high level of sensitivity and noninvasive nature, and can be utilized to assess eye disease and retinal degeneration (Duncan et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Vollrath et al., 2015). In mouse genetic retinal disease models, ERGs can be used to assess retinal degeneration at multiple time points as the disease progresses (Duncan et al., 2003). For studies evaluating the effect of drug treatment on the mouse eye, retinal function can be assessed before and after treatment in the same eye (Zhao et al., 2011). In the following protocol, we describe a method for measuring the functional response of photoreceptors and downstream retinal cells in mice that builds on a previously published approach (Phillips et al., 2010). The protocol can be readily applied to animals three weeks of age and older.

Exosomes are released by many cell types (Iglesias et al., 2012) into the extracellular milieu and are found in biological fluids including blood (Kaur et al., 2014) urine (Li et al., 2013) saliva (Madison et al., 2015) and breast milk (Madison et al., 2014; Naslund et al., 2014). Human semen contains a heterogenous population of nanovesicles (Madison et al., 2014; Madison et al., 2015) produced by tissues of the male genital tract including prostate secretory acinar cells (Sahlen et al., 2002) and epididymal epithelial cells (Frenette et al., 2010) as well as cells of the vasa deferentia, testes, and the vesicular glands (Renneberg et al., 1997; Sullivan et al., 2005). The variability in the cells that secret exosomes is reflected in the composition and function of exosomes. Thus, exosomal cargo composition and function are regulated by many factors including the type and condition of the originating cell (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013), cellular environment, and for in vivo derived exosomes; the condition of the donor (Welch et al., 2017). Released exosomes when taken up by target cells transfer their cargo, including proteins (Iglesias et al., 2012; Charrier et al., 2014), miRNA (Shtam et al., 2013; Ong et al., 2014), and mRNA (Tomasoni et al., 2013; Madison et al., 2014; Madison et al., 2015) to the target cells. As a result, exosomes are known to be involved in modulation of host immune response (Kaur et al., 2014; Vojtech et al., 2014), and regulation of microbial pathogenesis (Li et al.,

Bio-protocol-2918	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2213	In vitro Detection of Neutrophil Traps and Post-attack Cell Wall Changes in Candida Hyphae	Fungi, C. albicans, NETs, Host-pathogen interactions, Cell wall, sDectin-1-Fc Background C. albicans is a polymorphic opportunistic yeast and neutrophils are immune cells critical for defense against this and other fungal pathogens (Brown et al., 2012; Lionakis and Netea, 2013). NETs are a potential defense mechanism that can be deployed against pathogens and it has been suggested that they are preferentially deployed against microbial cells such as C. albicans hyphae that are too large to phagocytose (Urban et al., 2006; Bruns et al., 2010; Branzk et al., 2014; Rohm et al., 2014). NETs have been shown to contain a number of components including myeloperoxidase, extracellular DNA and citrullinated histones (Amulic et al., 2012; Branzk and Papayannopoulos, 2013). For positive identification of NETs, the standard in both in vitro and in vivo experiments includes staining for and demonstrating the colocalization of these markers. While the exact contribution of NETs to defense against C. albicans infection is not well understood, our group has demonstrated they can provoke stress responses and cell wall rearrangement in C. albicans hyphae. Specifically, NET attack results in greater chitin deposition and  -glucan exposure as shown schematically in Figure 1. These polysaccharides normally lie underneath the mannan layer, and their exposure can change immune recognition (Perez-Garcia et al., 2011). The basic assays described here were used extensively to probe this subject by our group (Hopke et al., 2016). While outlined here for the purpose of detecting NETs and fungal cell wall changes, this protocol is easily tweaked to leverage many combinations of chemical inhibitors, transgenic or knockout fungal strains or mouse neutrophils and other staining targets to test a wide array of hypotheses (Hopke et al., 2016). This protocol therefore represents a promising method to further elucidate the impact immune cells have on the C. albicans cell wall, its stress response and the importance of altered epitope exposure to host defense against fungal infection.

The mitotic spindle utilizes microtubule-based motor proteins to organize itself, and exert forces to drive cell division. Microtubulebased motor proteins produce mechanical work using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (Coppin et al., 1997). Motor proteins translocate microtubules in a unidirectional manner. The behavior of motility can be observed by in vitro gliding assay (Tao and Scholey, 2010), in which the motors are affixed onto a glass surface and supplied with microtubules and ATP. The motility of the motor proteins can then be studied using fluorescence microscopy and the details of their dynamic behavior can be observed in real time. This updated protocol will allow analysis of microtubule-based motor protein function with the use of in vitro microtubule gliding assays (Tao et al., 2006 and 2016).

McGraw1, 2, *	ER secretion, Secretory pathway, Adipocytes, Adipsin, Brefeldin A Background Newly synthesized proteins destined to be secreted from the cell traffic through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (PM). The secretory route includes transport from the ER to the Golgi, across the Golgi stacks, and movement from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to the PM. Each of these transport steps provides nodes for regulation of secretion. While most cells are capable of secreting proteins, certain specialized cell types are professional secreters of specific proteins. Adipocytes, for example, secrete hormones, called adipokines that affect the energy metabolism of various organs. To better understand the molecular underpinnings of adipokine secretion, we have developed an assay to study the transport of adipsin, an adipokine, from the ER to the Golgi of cultured adipocytes. A traditional and commonly used method of studying ER to Golgi transport is to monitor the exit of the temperature sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus G protein ts045 fused to GFP (VSVG-GFP) from the ER (Presley et al., 1997). An advantage of using the adipsin secretion assay to study ER to Golgi transport in adipocytes is that the flux of an endogenous protein from the ER is monitored rather than an ectopically-expressed reporter protein.
Bio-protocol-2928	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2203	Testing Depression in Mice: a Chronic Social Defeat Stress Model	Social defeat, Depression, Chronic stress, Social interaction, Mouse model Background  Depressive  disorders  are  recurring  and  life-threatening  conditions  that  affect approximately 120 million people worldwide. Of significant interest within the field of neuropsychiatric research is the development of valid animal models for depression to aid the understanding of the neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying depressive disorders. Various models of chronic stress have been used to induce symptoms in mice that are relevant to depression, among those are chronic unpredictable stress, foot-shock stress, immobilization stress followed by measurements of anhedonia or despair-like behaviors (e.g., sucrose preference test, forced swim test and tail suspension test), but they are not well validated as models of human depression (Krishnan and Nestler, 2011). Currently, chronic social defeat stress has been widely accepted as a well-validated model for depression, because of its reliability and reproducibility (Berton et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2007; Golden et al., 2011; Krishnan and Nestler, 2011; Russo and Nestler, 2013). The social defeat paradigm has been validated as a good model of human depression because of following reasons: 1) The depression phenotypes of susceptible mice (social avoidance, anhedonia, metabolic changes, etc.) are reversed by chronic treatment of anti-depressant drugs but not by acute administration. 2) Social defeat stress produces both a susceptible and resilient phenotype and this can be used to explain individual differences of human stress susceptibility in depression pathophysiology. 3) The susceptible phenotypes induced by social defeat stress are long lasting with concomitant genetic and epigenetic changes in the brain reward circuitry.

Bio-protocol-2930	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2201	Isolation and Analysis of Proteoglycans and Glycosaminoglycans from Archaeological Bones and Teeth	Proteoglycans, Glycosaminoglycans, Archaeological bones, Archaeological teeth, Isolation Background Bone tissue consists mainly of a mineral component (hydroxyapatite) and an organic matrix comprised of collagens, non-collagenous proteins and proteoglycans (PGs). As a result of binding tightly to hydroxyapatite, extracellular matrix proteins and PGs are protected from the destructive effects of temperature and chemical agents after death. However, to date only DNA and proteins had been successfully extracted from archaeological skeletons, and we therefore developed methods for isolating PGs and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains from archaeological bones and teeth. PGs and GAGs play a major role in bone morphogenesis, homeostasis and degenerative bone disease, and the analysis of these molecules from archaeological skeletons would unveil valuable paleontological information.

However, variation in behavior among individuals is often ignored when the quantitation of the behavior of groups is presented as means and associated dispersions. In this protocol, we describe an approach to characterize individuality in the habituation of the acoustic startle behavior at the population level in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. Our approach and set-up can be easily adapted to studies of individuality in other zebrafish larval behaviors.

This protocol aims to provide a reproducible and widely applicable method for the rapid identification of heparin/HS by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Small samples (0.3 m g) can be readily assessed in a non-destructive manner to ascertain an approximate purity that identifies other common contaminants found in biological samples when purifying heparin-like molecules. The procedures described herein are intended to provide a stepwise protocol suitable for a laboratory inexperienced in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analysis.

Bio-protocol-2937	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2194	Determination of Adeno-associated Virus Rep DNA Binding Using Fluorescence Anisotropy	Adeno-associated virus, Rep proteins, Fluorescence, Anisotropy, Protein-DNA binding Background Fluorescence polarization anisotropy has become one of the most popular methods to measure the interaction of proteins with a large variety of ligands including small molecules, nucleic acids, peptides and other proteins. The method is quick, inexpensive and can be modified to be used in plate readers equipped with fluorescence detectors. The technique is based on the principle that when a fluorescent molecule is excited with plane polarized light, the emitted light remains polarized in the same plane if the molecule is stationary or if it rotates slowly. In contrast, if the molecule rotates rapidly (due to small size), the light is emitted in a different plane. These changes can be quantified by the normalized differences in parallel and perpendicular intensities. Polarization is defined as P=(I_=-I_perp)/(I_= + l_perp) , where _= is the parallel intensity and vert_perp is the perpendicular intensity. An alternative way is to define the anisotropy,  A=(arl_--arl_perp)/(arl_-+2arl_perp) . Both parameters can be used interchangeably to describe the changes in polarization. Thus, when a small fluorescent DNA molecule binds a protein, the larger complex will rotate more slowly than the DNA molecule, changing the plane of the polarized light and increasing the anisotropy value. We have used this technique to measure the binding affinity of AAV Rep68 for different DNA substrates (Yoon-Robarts et al., 2004; Musayev et al., 2015; Bardelli et al., 2016). The non-structural AAV Rep proteins carry out most of the DNA transactions that are required to complete the virus life cycle. These include DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, site-specific integration and packaging of DNA into preformed capsids (Im and Muzyczka, 1990; Weitzman et al., 1994; Wonderling et al., 1995). The large AAV Rep proteins (Rep78/Rep68) contain an N-terminal origin binding domain (OBD) that specifically binds the Rep binding sites (RBS) and displays nuclease activity (Hickman et al., 2004; Musayev et al., 2015). The RBS sites consist of two or more 5’-GCTC- 3^ repeats and are found at the viral origin of replication, in several promoters and at the AAVS1 integration site (Weitzman et al., 1994; McCarty et al., 1994). In addition, a C-terminus SF3 helicase domain is required for high affinity binding and DNA unwinding (James et al., 2003; Mansilla-Soto et al., 2009).The protocol described here can be modified to fit any protein-DNA system or any other instrument such as plate readers.
Bio-protocol-2938	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2193	RNA-protein UV-crosslinking Assay	RNA-protein interaction, UV-crosslinking, RNA-binding proteins Background RNA-protein interactions are mediated by transient non-covalent interactions such as electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between specific residues in RNA and protein molecules. Short wave UV radiation can induce covalent bond formation between two closely placed aromatic rings. Aromatic ring structures are found in several amino acids in proteins and in nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids. Therefore, UV irradiation is used to covalently link RNA and interacting proteins, whereby the RNA-protein complex can be further analysed by SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protocol describes a simple and rapid assay system that can assay RNA-protein interactions and their binding kinetics in vitro. Also, mass spectrometric analysis of the fluorescently-labeled RNA-protein complexes obtained by this method can lead to identification of novel RNA-protein interactions.

Rubisco has been isolated from a wide range of organisms, from archaea, bacteria, algae to plants, and displays a diverse range of kinetics between organisms (Galmes et al., 2014; Tcherkez et al., 2006; Whitney et al., 2011). Knowledge of Rubisco kinetics is a key component for understanding how photosynthesis and thus the biological sink of carbon will respond to rising anthropogenic C O_2 . Diatoms are a group of unicellular algae responsible for 20% of global photosynthesis (Falkowski and Raven, 2007) but as yet have been relatively poorly studied in terms of their Rubisco kinetics.

We found that with validated peptide/MHC II tetramer combinations, a simpler protocol based on direct tetramer labeling of 5×10^6 patient Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), followed by acquisition of all events on a flow cytometer, resulted in reliable detection of HIV-specific D4^+ T cells.

Activated  D8^+ T cells express chemokine receptors, such as CXCR3, allowing them to migrate towards the chemokines CXCL9, 10 and 11, often upregulated at the injured tissue. The evaluation of molecular cues that modulate T cell migration is important to understand the biology behind their functions but the complex mechanisms operating in vivo are sometimes hard to deconvolve. Here, we provide detailed information on an in vitro method to evaluate chemokine functions on  D8^+ T cells, focusing on CXCL10-mediated chemo-attraction and CXCR3 internalization. We use antigen-specific transgenic  D8^+ T cells that can be easily expanded and activated in vitro, therefore providing enough number of phenotypically identical lymphocytes (e.g., high chemokine-receptor expression on their surface), required to perform an assay using enough replicates for biologically significant observations and statistical analysis. The cells used per assay originate from one single animal, therefore accounting for reduction of animal usage. This assay is combined with flow cytometry analysis, permitting simultaneous evaluation of 1) number of migrating  D8^+ T cells; and 2) phenotypic characterization of chemokine receptor levels on their surface.

Bio-protocol-2948	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2183	In vitro Assay to Assess Efficacy of Potential Antiviral Compounds against Enterovirus D68	Enterovirus D68, Antiviral assay, CPE, MTS/PMS solution, Cell culture Background As a re-emerging pathogen, antiviral compounds targeting EV-D68 were rarely reported before. It is urgently needed to establish and develop antiviral methods to combat the potential EV-D68 epidemic. Here, we report a detailed protocol which can be used to identify selective anti-EV-D68 compounds. To screen and identify potential antiviral compounds, the MTS-based CPE reduction assay is reproducible, easy-to-use and time-saving method which is widely used. This method relies on the ability of a compound to inhibit EV-D68-induced reduction of CPE. When a compound actively inhibits the replication of EV-D68, the virus-induced CPE will be reduced or absent. As a consequence, the metabolically active cells are able to convert a yellow tetrazolium salt substrate (MTS/PMS) to a browncolored formazan product. When a compound does not have antiviral effects, the host cells die of virusinduced CPE, which will lack metabolic activity, and the yellow substrate remains un-metabolized. The colorimetric conversion is quantitative, as an E C50 can be calculated from the data generated by this assay.

This analysis, although very useful, lacks information about the direct control of the dysregulated genes. To further investigate these genes, in silico analysis using bioinformatics provides additional information to identify direct targets of the transcription factor studied. Additionally, the functionality of these response elements can be analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis and promoter-gene-reporter assays. We have shown recently that the oncogenic transcription factor MYC (Cellular Myelocytomatosis Oncogene) controls the expression of the ITGA1 (integrin alpha 1 subunit) gene in colorectal cancer, and that their expression correlates in 72% of colorectal tumors. This protocol describes a procedure for the analysis of the ITGA1 promoter and the identification of response elements for the MYC oncogene. The latter is known to be a member of the MYC/MAX/MAD network. Interactions between these factors lead to gene activation or repression depending on upstream signalization and cell condition.

Bio-protocol-2953	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2178	Measurement of RNA-induced PKR Activation in vitro	PKR, Stress response, Innate immunity, Aberrant RNA Background PKR is one of four mammalian kinases that phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2- α subunit (eIF2α) in response to stress signals. PKR is activated mainly in response to viral infection (Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005). PKR is a key component of innate immunity that recognizes and binds to pathogenic RNAs. The interaction of RNAs with PKR promotes and stabilizes its dimerization. PKR then undergoes auto-phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates eIF2α to shut off general translation, while activating the downstream signaling cascade including the increased translation of the ATF4 stress response transcription factor (Hinnebusch, 2005).
Bio-protocol-2954	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2177	Determination of the Predatory Capability of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100	Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, Predatory bacteria, Predatory quantification Background In the last years, Bdellovibrio has attracted the interest of the scientific community and several applications have been developed, such as evolution studies (Davidov and Jurkevitch, 2009), identification of new biocatalysts (Martínez et al., 2012), therapeutic applications (Atterbury et al., 2011), or biotechnological applications using Bdellovibrio as a lytic agent for the recovery of value added intracellular bioproducts (Martínez et al., 2016). Due to the growing interest in Bdellovibrio, different indirect methods to quantify this predatory bacterium have been developed (Mahmoud et al., 2007; Lambert and Sockett, 2008; Van Essche et al., 2009). However, direct quantification of Bdellovibrio via double-layer method is still necessary to thoroughly characterize Bdellovibrio predatory capability. Here, we describe a well-established, reliable, and broadly used method that allows Bdellovibrio cell number quantification in predatory co-cultures.
Bio-protocol-2955	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2176	Isolation of Ribosomal Particles from the Unicellular Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Anabaena variabilis strain M3 (PCC 7118, ATCC 27892) 70S ribosomal particles have been isolated by differential centrifugation and then, ribosomal proteins were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Sato et al., 1998). Ribosomes have also been prepared from Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 cells using a protocol combining differential centrifugation and sucrose step gradients (Sugita et al., 2000). Fractionation of cell extracts by differential centrifugation has also been employed in the preparation of ribosomal samples for the development of an in vitro translation system in different Synechococcus strains (Mutsuda and Sugiura, 2006). The method described here for Synechocystis, based on the one described for Synechococcus (Sugita et al., 2000), allows purification of ribosomal particles using ultracentrifugation of linear sucrose gradients.
Bio-protocol-2956	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2175	Differential Salt Fractionation of Nuclei to Analyze Chromatin-associated Proteins from Cultured Mammalian Cells	Chromatin, Fractionation, Salt gradient, Virus, Chromatin association, Micrococcal nuclease Background Many chromatin-associated proteins are insoluble under low salt conditions because of their charged-based interaction with DNA or histones. Since salt disrupts charged-based protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, chromatin-associated proteins become more soluble with increasing concentration of NaCl (Teves and Henikoff, 2012). Proteins strongly bound to DNA are expected to elute with high salt whereas loosely bound proteins, such as transcription factors, will elute with low salt. We are specifically interested in how virus infection alters the composition of factors associated with the cellular chromatin. Nuclear replicating viruses, such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and EpsteinBarr virus, dramatically alter the appearance of the host chromatin during infection (Avgousti et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2010; Simpson-Holley et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2013). We hypothesized that these changes in appearance are partly due to differences in protein composition of host chromatin. Changes in host chromatin could reflect antiviral defenses mounted by the cell or active manipulation by the virus. To compare association of proteins with chromatin in uninfected and infected cells we developed this protocol to fractionate nuclei using a salt gradient (Figure 1). In this protocol we isolate nuclei, digest the DNA down to mono-nucleosome length, and then wash the nuclei with increasing concentrations of salt, collecting each fraction for analysis by Western blotting. We recently used this protocol to elucidate changes to cellular chromatin during infection with adenovirus (Avgousti et al., 2016). We now present this protocol as a general approach to monitor association of proteins with chromatin under a wide range of perturbing conditions.

Bio-protocol-2958	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2173	Mouse Model of Reversible Intestinal Inflammation	Colitis, Remission, Relapsing disease, Mucosal healing Background Our understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine, has been greatly improved with the development of animal models aiming to recapitulate human disease (Khanna et al., 2014). Despite the identification of a wide array of immunological targets, current therapies have had limited success in treating IBD and limited knowledge is available about the mechanisms that are induced in the establishment of long-term remission and the associated mucosal healing (D’Haens et al., 2014). A major limitation, so far, has been the lack of animal models in which remission can be reproducibly induced in animals with established disease. In models of infection induced intestinal inflammation, pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory mechanisms can be operative simultaneously, implying that dissecting the role of different immune pathways during resolution of inflammation may be a challenge (Endt et al., 2010; Sonnenberg et al., 2011). In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis, DSS can be easily administered in the drinking water to either induce acute or chronic intestinal inflammation and this is followed by treatment with normal drinking water to study resolution of colitis. However, the kinetics and severity of disease are highly dependent on numerous factors including differences in the dose of DSS used and critically on the amount of DSS consumed which is virtually impossible to normalize between different animals of the same cage (Chassaing et al., 2014; Perše and Cerar, 2012). Using the T cell transfer mediated colitis model, it was elegantly shown that intestinal inflammation can be reversed by the adoptive transfer of CD45RBlo regulatory T cells (Treg) in colitic animals, resulting in remission induction within 10-14 weeks post Treg transfer (Mottet et al., 2003). The kinetics of remission induction however varies depending on the expansion of transferred Treg and it can be difficult to synchronize the onset of remission between animals of same experimental group. To overcome the unpredictable timing and extent of remission induction, we developed a new mouse model of reversible intestinal inflammation in which intestinal inflammation (induced by the adoptive transfer of naïve CD45RBhi T cells in lymphopenic animals) can be reversed by depletion of colitogenic D4^+ T cells in mice with established disease, resulting in reproducible induction of remission from colitis (Brasseit et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-2961	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2170	In Gel Kinase Assay	Kinases, Phosphorylation, in vivo, Enzymatic activity, SnRKs, ABA, Arabidopsis Background The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a key signal involved in plant growth and development as well as in plant response to abiotic and biotic stress. The ABA perception and signaling pathway is composed of PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1/PYR1-LIKE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (PYR/PYL/RCAR-ABA receptors), PP2Cs phosphatases and SnRK2s kinases (reviewed in Antoni et al., 2011). The module receptor-ABA-phosphatase controls the phosphorylation signaling cascades in a ligand-dependent manner through regulation of ABA-activated SnRK2s. In turn, SnRK2s kinases phosphorylate a myriad of effectors, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, from transcription factors (e.g., ABFs) to ion channels (e.g., SLAC1). We show here the protocol ‘In Gel Kinase Assay’ in details. This protocol was developed for protein kinase activity measurement in plant tissues protein extracts as well as from purified recombinant kinases. In brief: an SDS-polyacrylamide gel is prepared containing the ∆C-ABF2 peptide (a specific SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3, OST1/SnRK2.6 kinase substrate). ∆C-ABF2 peptide is trapped in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel mesh and it does not migrate during electrophoresis. On the other hand, SDS-treated protein samples, without boiling and without any reducing agent (e.g., DTT or B-ME), are only partially denatured and can be re-naturalized in some degree after washing SDS out. Moreover, kinase activity at a high sensitive level can be measured using Gamma-32pATP. In this way, together with the kinase activity value we also have the electrophoretic mobility value associated with the kinase activity. Using a plant crude protein extract, and after sample electrophoresis and in gel protein renaturalization step, we can measure specific SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6 (SnRK2s) kinase activity in gel. We have applied this protocol to characterize SnRK2s activity in a PYR/PYL/RCAR-ABA receptor sextuple mutant. We show that the sextuple mutant line pyr/pyl112458 is impaired in ABA-mediated activation of SnRK2s, as much as the triple mutant snrk2.2/2.3/2.6 in Arabidopsis thaliana (result published in Gonzalez-Guzman et al., 2012).
Bio-protocol-2962	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2169	Liposome Flotation Assays for Phosphoinositide-protein Interaction	Liposome flotation assay, Phosphoinositides, Protein-lipid interaction, Unilamellar vesicles Background Several methods exist to analyze protein-phosphoinositide binding and the specificity towards the different members of the phosphoinositide family: lipid overlay, lipid flotation assay and surface plasma resonance (SPR). A Lipid flotation assay consists in the incubation of unilamellar vesicles with the protein of interest, and the subsequent flotation of the vesicles on a sucrose cushion, which will separate vesicle-bound proteins from unbound proteins and vesicles alone. Compared to the other methods a lipid flotation assay is i) technically easier and cheaper than SPR and ii) more specific and closer to physiological conditions, as it mimics the curvature of membranes, in contrast to proteinoverlay assays, where lipids are dried on a flat nitrocellulose membrane. This protocol describes the binding of recombinant GST-tagged proteins to unilamellar vesicles of defined size and lipid composition, in particular regarding the specificity towards the different monophosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIP).

Based on a recent mechanistic study that links the MLL1 complex to the naïve state, this protocol provides a straightforward and robust method to restore naïve pluripotency from EpiSCs via targeting  MLL1  mediated  H3K4  methylation  and  subsequent  transcription  regulation.  The reprogramming efficiency is significantly higher than previous published method, achieving 50% conversion rate in two weeks.

Bio-protocol-2965	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2166	Multiplexed GuideRNA-expression to Efficiently Mutagenize Multiple Loci in Arabidopsis by CRISPR-Cas9	CRISPR-Cas9, Multiplexing, gRNA, Gene editing, Arabidopsis Background The RNA-guided Cas9-system is derived from the bacterial defense system against foreign DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). It has been recognized as a method of choice for genome editing because of its high efficiency, easy handling and possibility of multiplex editing. In general, the Cas9- gene editing system involves a single synthetic RNA molecule, the gRNA that directs the Cas9 protein to target the desired DNA site for genome modification or transcriptional control. The gRNA-Cas9 complex recognizes the targeted DNA by gRNA-DNA pairing and requires the presence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is represented by the nucleotides NGG or less specific NAG (with N for any nucleotide) in the target site following the gRNA-DNA pairing region. Thus, the approximate 20 nucleotide long gRNA spacer sequence, i.e., the part of the gRNA sequence complementary to the DNA target site, determines the specificity of the complex. In this protocol, we describe the details to generate a binary vector that contains both the gRNA and the Cas9 coding sequence by classic cloning (Figure 1). As our vector system allows for subsequent addition of further gRNAs, it can be used for multiplex editing of the Arabidopsis genome and to obtain multiple, stably inherited alleles. Strong expression of the Cas9 protein and the gRNAs especially in proliferating tissues is achieved by the use of the A. thaliana UBQ10- and the U6-promoter, respectively. First mutations can be detected in the T1 generation, and T-DNA- and Cas9-free mutant plants may already be selected in the T2 generation. Besides the selection of the gRNA and the construction of the plasmid, we give an overview of efficient genotyping methods required for detection of small or large deletions.

However, there was one exception: a homology-independent, plasmidbased knock-in method developed in zebrafish (Auer et al., 2014). This method, like knock-in blunt ligation, relies on the machinery of canonical non-homologous end-joining to insert a linearized, bluntended, double-stranded DNA fragment into a genomic double-strand break with a high degree of precision and minimal loss of nucleotides. Both methods are similar to a method developed for zincfinger nucleases and TALENs known as obligate ligation-gated recombination (ObLiGaRe; Maresca et al., 2013), which relied on the generation of compatible overhangs to facilitate insertion of target DNA into the genome. Both the Auer method and ObLiGaRe rely on delivery of a vector bearing the desired transgene construct, which could lead to incorporation of undesirable exogenous sequences. Because of the propensity of Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 to make blunt-ended double-strand breaks, we reasoned that exogenous sequence delivery in genome engineering experiments could be limited to solely the CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector and a PCR-generated amplicon of solely the sequence of interest. Thus, knock-in blunt cloning possesses the dual advantages of minimizing the introduction of exogenous sequences and its reliance on canonical non-homologous end-joining rather than homologous recombination. While the following protocol is specifically for human HEK293 cells, we note that this method is likely to be broadly applicable to eukaryotic cells.

In fact, it is estimated that only 1% of the virome has been sequenced and annotated (Mokili et al., 2012). Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables examination of the entire virome, including unculturable viruses. Stool is a readily obtainable specimen type for study of the virome, and alterations in the fecal virome have been associated with a number of disease states (Handley et al., 2012; Norman et al., 2015; Monaco et al., 2016). The fecal virome is largely comprised of bacteriophages, which affect the gastrointestinal tract through alterations in bacterial functions and populations (Duerkop and Hooper, 2013; Reyes et al., 2013; Virgin, 2014). Enteric eukaryotic viruses, while less ubiquitous than bacteriophages, play a more direct role in gastrointestinal tract dysfunction by inducing gastroenteritis, enteritis and colitis. Despite the abundance of bacteriophages in fecal samples, only a few studies thus far have examined the contributions of fecal bacteriophages in human diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with increased enteric bacteriophage richness (Norman et al., 2015). In contrast, profound immunosuppression from AIDS in a sub-Saharan cohort resulted in an expanded eukaryotic virome, but had minimal impact on bacteriophage populations (Monaco et al., 2016). More studies are needed to elucidate the role the fecal virome plays in disease states. A key roadblock to studying the stool virome is viral nucleic acid extraction and enrichment from fecal material. Several factors can contribute to difficulty in isolating viral sequences from fecal samples, chief among them the fact that viruses constitute a minority of fecal sample material. Additionally, dilution of feces in collection media (such as RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent) can further hamper the ability to find viral sequences. While many nucleic acid extraction protocols can be used for high input nucleic acid samples to enrich for viral nucleic acid, low input samples, such as those diluted in collection media, represent a challenge with virome studies. After comparison and optimization of several methods, the following protocol was identified as the most universally applicable for isolation of phage and DNA viral sequences from both low (Monaco et al., 2016) and high (Norman et al., 2015) input samples.

Each protocol has both advantages and disadvantages. Open-skull has best optical imaging quality, unlimited repetitive imaging times and large field of view, but needs to wait for 2 weeks to recover from surgery and also has the inflammation and glia activation issue; Thinned-skull protocol has minimal disturbance from inflammation and glia activation on the brain, but has limited repetitive imaging times, only 2-5 times for a cranial window, small field of view( <300um in diameter); Polished and reinforced thinned-skull method allows unlimited repetitive imaging, large field view ecause3m m in diameter) and minimal disturbance, but the optical imaging quality decreases over time because of light diffusion and absorption at the interface with regenerated bone. Researcher may choose an appropriate protocol according to specific study.

D. coniospora grows slowly on standard growth media, rendering in vitro study difficult and making it hard to develop transformation methods. We report here a culture method that allows the rapid production of large quantities of D . coniospora, opening the way to its genetic modification. Polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation is probably the simplest method that has been broadly applied to modify fungi. We found that it can be used with D. coniospora, thus providing the first approach to modify its genome deliberately.
Bio-protocol-2975	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2156	Protein Synthesis Rate Assessment by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)	Caenorhabditis elegans, FRAP, Messenger RNA, Protein synthesis, Protein translation Background Proper regulation of protein synthesis is critical for cell homeostasis and growth. Deregulation of protein synthesis has been implicated in pathologies such as cancer and senescent decline (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Syntichaki et al., 2007). Currently available biochemical methods for measuring general protein synthesis rate include metabolic labeling and polysomal profiling (Martin, 1998; Rennie et al., 1994). The applicability of these methodologies is limited due to poor intake and uncontrolled or unequal distribution of the label throughout the animal or tissue of interest. Also, these methods lack specificity and significant changes in specific cells or tissues of interest may be masked due to variability in intrinsic rates of translation of the bulk of the sample. In this protocol, we describe a method for monitoring protein synthesis rates in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The experimental approach is based on the expression of fluorescent proteins, in cells and tissues of interest of transgenic animals. Fluorescence is then photobleached by irradiating cells, tissues or whole animals with a powerful light source. Recovery of fluorescence, indicative of new protein synthesis, is then monitored in cells or tissues of interest.

To characterize abilities of odor detection in genetically modified mice, the olfactory habituationdishabituation test was performed using either filter paper or cotton scented with a test odor (Kobayakawa et al., 2007; Ferquson et al., 2000). There is a natural tendency of mice preferentially exploring novelty such as a novel odor and a novel object (Bevins and Besheer, 2006). Therefore, there is no training in advance before starting these tests. However, it is difficult to constantly supply the test odor especially at lower concentrations (around the detection threshold), because the odor is diluted by diffusion during the test. Here, we describe a method for the olfactory habituation-dishabituation test using an olfactometer. This method has an advantage in the point that mice are exposed to the odor at a constant concentration during the test, compared with that using the filter paper (Takahashi et al., 2016).
Bio-protocol-2978	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2153	Olfactory Avoidance Test (Mouse)	Olfaction, Odor detection threshold, Behavioral test, Mouse, Freezing, Avoidance Background Olfactory system is a good model for studying the sensory processing in the brain. To characterize innate fear responses such as freezing and avoidance in genetically modified mice, the olfactory avoidance test was performed using a component of fox feces, TMT (2,5-dihydro-2,4,5- trimethylthiazoline; Kobayakawa et al., 2007). Furthermore, the olfactory avoidance using the different amounts of TMT was carried out to know the odor detection threshold in gene-knockout mice (KanekoGoto et al., 2013). Recently, we have reported that non-dihydrogenated TMT (nTMT: 2,4,5- trimethylthiazole) also induces similar freezing and avoidance responses (Takahashi et al., 2016). Here, we describe a method for the olfactory avoidance test with nTMT (commercially available) to explore the odor detection threshold in mice. This method has an advantage in the point using a simple device such as cage and filter paper, compare with that using an olfactometer.

This protocol describes cathodal stimulation, which uses the fact that the membrane potential of a neuron at rest is negative while the extracellular surrounding is positive in comparison. Two electrodes are needed: (1) a stimulation electrode (cathode) placed in close proximity to the axon, and (2) a reference electrode (anode) placed in the bath. When activated, the stimulation electrode adds electrons and thus negative charge to the outside of the axon. This makes the outside of the axon less positive and, as a consequence, decreases the potential difference between inside and outside of the neuron. The result is a local depolarization inside the axon. If sufficient in magnitude, this elicits an AP. The elicited AP originates close to the stimulation electrode and propagates bi-directionally along the axon.

Recently, this method has gained support as an optimal procedure for lignin quantification, as opposed to the alternative thioglycolic acid and Klason lignin methods (Moreira-Vilar et al., 2014). Comparison of these three methods has empirically shown that the acetyl bromide method consistently results in the highest recovery of lignin, and is insensitive to tissue type, extent of lignification, and lignin composition (MoreiraVilar et al., 2014). In our previous work (Kapp et al., 2015), we adapted the scale of the acetyl bromide assay to facilitate a rapid, small-scale determination of lignin that uses a small amount of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) derived from Brachypodium distachyon, based on a protocol described in the ‘Microscale Method for Cuvettes’ method detailed by Chang et al. (2008). The protocol described below can be performed with standard laboratory equipment and requires 5-9 days total after harvesting plant material, which can be derived from a variety of tissues or developmental stages.
Bio-protocol-2983	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2148	Production of Guide RNAs in vitro and in vivo for CRISPR	Ribozyme, CRISPR, RNA polymerase II promoter, Genome editing, RNA transcription Background Almost all of the reported cases of CRISPR-mediated gene editing used promoters of small nuclear RNAs such as the U6 and U3 snRNA promoters to drive the production of gRNAs in vivo (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). However, the U6 and U3 promoters have several major limitations: 1) They are constitutively active and not tunable; 2) They lack cell/tissue specificities; 3) They have not been well defined in many organisms; 4) U6 requires a G and U3 requires an A for transcription initiation, thus limiting target selections; 5) They are not suitable for in vitro transcriptions because of the lack of commercial RNA polymerase III. Unfortunately, RNA polymerase II promoters, which constitute the majority of the characterized promoters, cannot be directly used for gRNA production in vivo because of the following reasons: 1) The primary transcripts of RNA polymerase II promoters undergo extensive processing such as varsigma_^ -end capping, acute3 -end polyadenylation, and splicing out of the introns. Some of the modifications may render the designed gRNA non-functional. 2) The mature RNA molecules are transported into cytosol; thus they are physically separated from the intended targets that are located in the nucleus. That is why production of gRNA in vivo using U6 and U3 snRNA promoters has been the dominant method (Gao and Zhao, 2014; Yoshioka et al., 2015). In this protocol, we use a ribozymebased strategy to overcome the aforementioned limitations of RNA polymerase III promoters, enabling gRNA production from any promoters and in any organisms. We design an artificial gene named RGR (Ribozyme-gRNA-Ribozyme) that, once transcribed, generates an RNA molecule with ribozyme sequences flanking both ends of the designed gRNA (Gao and Zhao, 2014). We show that the primary transcripts of RGR undergo self-catalyzed cleavage to precisely release the desired gRNA, which can efficiently guide sequence‐specific cleavage of DNA targets in vitro and in vivo (Gao and Zhao, 2014).

However, protocols must also be adapted to the plant material being studied and as such can incorporate different steps. Extraction of epiphyte DNA must also ensure that there is no contamination from endophytic microorganisms. The protocol described integrates elements from previous reports (Miles et al., 2012; Araujo et al., 2002), but was not identical given the characteristics of the plant material used. In this work we used leaves from Espeletia hartwegiana, a plant that is endemic to the Paramo ecosystem present in the Colombian Andean mountains. These leaves are characterized to be large and succulent with the presence of short hairs on the surface (pubescence) that require removal prior to leaf surface sterilization and DNA isolation. Here, although the pubescence is removed, the microorganisms associated with it are dislodged first to ensure a complete picture of the epiphyte community. In this case, sufficient DNA of good quality was recovered for PCR amplification and 16S rRNA gene analysis and for functional analysis using the GeoChip (Yan et al., 2015). Nonetheless, other downstream applications could require more DNA and hence more plant material.
Bio-protocol-2990	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2141	Rice Root Organic Acid Efflux Measurement by Using Ion Chromatography	Organic acids, Rice, Collection, Measurement, Ion chromatography Background In addition to enzymatic methods (Delhaize et a I. , 1993) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Chen et al., 2013), ion chromatography is another widely used method for the determination of organic acids, which has previously been employed to detect the significant increase in oxalate content in taro root exudates during AI^3+ stress (Ma and Miyasaka, 1998). Compared to ion chromatography, alternative methods have their own defects. For example, enzymatic methods require the use of enzymes that can easily undergo denaturation. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish oxalate acid from Cl- peaks by HPLC. Here, we describe a method for analyzing organic acids secreted by rice roots using ion chromatography. This method could be used in the analysis of organic acids that are secreted by other hydroponically cultivated plants.

To fit in and then efficiently take advantage of this rhythmic change of the environment, most if not all organisms have an endogenous activity rhythm of 24~h~ , which is called circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms provide evolutionary advantages to those organisms. The long-term disruption of circadian rhythms is extremely harmful (Ma et al., 2013). In humans, many diseases, including cancer, hypertension, and sleep disorders, are closely related with a disrupted circadian rhythm (Shi et al., 2013; Roenneberg and Merrow, 2016).

The genetic and molecular factors that drive local tumor development and progression to metastatic disease, however, remain incompletely understood. Both genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models and xenograft models of prostate cancer have contributed to our understanding of the genetics of prostate cancer (Ittmann et al., 2013; Park et al., 2010). Genetic manipulation, either by prostate specific transgenic overexpression such as in Hi-Myc mice (Ellwood-Yen et al., 2003) or by prostate specific deletion such as in Pten-/- mice (Wang et al., 2003), is advantageous because it models tumor development and progression in the organ microenvironment in an immune competent mouse. Development of metastatic prostate cancer is variable among these GEM models, with a low frequency in some such as the Pten-/- model (Wang et al., 2003), and a higher frequency in other models such as TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate) (Greenberg et al., 1995) and Hi-Myc/Pten-/- (Hubbard et al., 2016). Despite their great utility for prostate cancer research, it is difficult, timeconsuming, and costly to further genetically manipulate GEM models. To overcome some of these limitations, researchers have relied on both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts of human cell lines. Cell lines can be genetically manipulated in vitro in a variety of ways. While subcutaneous xenografts are advantageous due to their ease of injection and monitoring, orthotopic xenografts better recapitulate the local tumor microenvironment which may affect sensitivity to drugs (Wilmanns et al., 1992; Kuo et al., 1993), methylation patterns (Fleming et al., 2010), growth rate (Fleming et al., 2010), and ultimately predictions for clinical response (Killion et al., 1998; Hoffman, 1999). In addition, some human prostate cancer cell line models metastasize from xenografts implanted orthotopically. A limitation of all xenograft models is that they require immunocompromised mice making it difficult to model tumor progression in an intact immune system. The Myc-CaP cell line (Watson et al., 2005) allows for engraftment either subcutaneously or orthotopically in immune competent syngeneic (FVB/N) mice (Watson et al., 2005; Hurley et al., 2015). Myc-CaP was derived from a prostate carcinoma from a Hi-Myc mouse (Watson et al., 2005). When engrafted orthotopically, Myc-CaP cells metastasize to abdominal lymph nodes, liver, and lung (Hurley et al., 2015). Additionally, Myc-CaP is amenable to in vitro manipulation of gene expression (Hurley et al., 2015). Thus, Myc-CaP can be used as an easily manipulable model for both tumor growth in the prostate and metastatic growth in mice with an intact immune system. Herein, we describe the methods for orthotopic engraftment of Myc-CaP cells into the mouse anterior prostate.
Bio-protocol-2995	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2136	Establishment of New Split-root System by Grafting	Cotton, Split-root system, Graft, Unequal treatment, Scion, Stock Background The split-root system has been used to study plant responses to heterogeneous soil conditions such as partial root drying, unequal salt distribution, and heterogeneous nutrient distribution. The conventional split-root system in cotton and other plants are established by dividing the lateral roots into two equal parts after cutting of the main root of a seedling (Bazihizina et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010). The new system was suitable for plant growth in nutrient solution and for a girdling experiment because there was sufficient distance between the root and position of the graft (Kong et al., 2012 and 2016).

Also, we previously developed a novel unimpaired root dip-inoculation method to assess the pathogenicity of V. dahliae in cotton (Gao et al., 2010). The regular procedure for infection of plants with the soil-borne pathogen is to uproot soil-grown plants, incubate the roots in a conidial suspension, and then replant the plants in fresh soil. Our inoculation method avoids damaging the roots and is convenient for operation, which combined the protocol of fungal recovery from stem facilitates the pathogenicity study of soil-borne pathogens that colonize the vascular tissues.
Bio-protocol-2999	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2132	Protocol for Murine/Mouse Platelets Isolation and Their Reintroduction in vivo	Platelets, Coagulation, Fluorescent labeling, Vital dye, Clot Background Platelets are known to be essential for metastasis, but also to play roles during tumor growth not to mention clot formation. In order to readily identify and track platelets we developed the means for fluorescently labeling and reinfusing platelets. This allows them to be readily identified in tissues without immunostaining. Using these methods, we showed that interactions between tumor cells and platelets play key roles in survival of the tumour cells early during metastasis (Im et al., 2004; GilBernabe et al., 2012). Platelets formed clots with tumor cells in the blood stream and this coagulation promoted spreading and subsequent retention of the tumor cells during lung metastasis (Im et al., 2004). Tissue factor expressed by tumor cells is capable of mediating clot formation with platelets and recruitment of macrophages (Gil-Bernabe et al., 2012). The interaction of platelets, thrombin and fibrin also have been reported to promote metastasis by generating epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the cancer cells and evasion from the immune system by protection from NK cells as well as secretion of pro-metastatic chemokines and cytokines (Labelle et al., 2011; Nieswandt et al., 1999; Palumbo et al., 2005 and 2007). Precise tracking of platelets will provide opportunities to uncover how tumor cells utilize the host for their survival.
Bio-protocol-3000	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2131	Analysis of Cancer Stromal Reaction Using an O-ring Co-culture Assay	Cancer, Stromal reaction, Fibroblasts, Extracellular matrix and proteoglycans Background The growth and survival of a tumour within a tissue depends upon interactions with surrounding stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and lymphatic cells. Research has shown that as tumours grow there is extensive cross-talk between the cancer cells and the surrounding fibroblasts. Moreover, the tumour cells may activate these fibroblasts into tumourassociated fibroblasts (TAFs). In some instances, these fibroblasts may restrict tumour growth (CoulsonThomas et al., 2011 and 2013); however, in many cases these TAFs aid tumour cell growth and survival (Coulson-Thomas et al., 2010 and 2015). Therefore, in vitro cancer studies should also take into account the protective effects TAFs can have on cancer cells. Taking this into account, we developed a 2D heterotypic co-culture technique between fibroblasts and cancer cells that enables the study of TAFs and cancer cells in the same system.
Bio-protocol-3001	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2130	Enriching Acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing Bacteria in No-flow, Fed-batch Systems	Acid mine drainage, Enrichment, Bioreactor, Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, Bioremediation Background Low-pH microbial Fe(II) oxidation can be incorporated into AMD passive treatment systems by enhancing the development of terraced iron formations (DeSa et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2011; Larson et al., 2014a and 2014b). For extremely difficult-to-treat AMD (very low pH, very high concentrations of Fe(II) and associated metals), an active treatment bioreactor is required by enriching acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterial communities. This process can effectively change a high acidity, high metals discharge into a moderate acidity (still low pH), low metals discharge (Sheng et al., 2016). Acidophilic  aerobic  Fe(II)  oxidizers  Acidithiobacillus  spp.,  Leptospirillum  spp.,  and  Ferrovum myxofaciens have all been enriched in both suspended growth and fixed-film laboratory-scale bioreactors for AMD treatment (Hedrich and Johnson, 2012; Heinzel et al., 2009a and 2009b; Janneck et al., 2010; Tischler et al., 2013). For instance, Hedrich and Johnson (2012) designed an AMD remediation system that integrated low-pH Fe(II) oxidation and Fe removal in a multi-reactor system. A pure culture of the Fe(II)-oxidizer Ferrovum myxofaciens was enriched in first suspended-growth reactor. Heinzel et al. (2009a and 2009b), Janneck et al. (2010) and Tischler et al. (2013) all developed a natural mixed community of Fe(II)-oxidizers with porous fixed-film media in a pilot-scale reactor. A protocol of enriching mixed culture acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria in no-flow, fed-batch systems without fixedfilm media is suggested here in a chemostatic bioreactor with controlled hydrogeochemical conditions (Sheng et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-3004	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2127	Force Measurement on Mycoplasma mobile Gliding Using Optical Tweezers	Mycoplasma, Optical tweezers, Force, Avidin-biotin, Bead Background Surface motility systems are spread over many bacterial species and they are not well elucidated compared to bacterial flagella and eukaryotic motor proteins (Jarrell and McBride, 2008), although potentially they can give us critical information to understand the survival strategy of bacteria. To elucidate a motility mechanism, we need information about the structure of machinery, the flow of energy, and the mechanical characters including speed and force. Optical tweezers are a special method used for micromanipulations or force measurements in the piconewton range under microscopy, by which an object with a diffractive index different from the medium is trapped at the center of focused laser beam (Ashkin et al., 1986). This method has greatly contributed to clarifying the features of motility systems including myosin, dynein, and kinesin, and now an established method in the field of biophysics. Here, we provide a protocol on how to measure force generated by surface moving microorganisms, based on our studies (Miyata et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2016) for gliding mechanism of M. mobile the fastest gliding species in class Mollicutes. This is the first protocol for force measurement made using optical tweezers in bio-protocol.

For example, large scale genetic interaction screens in yeast were recently used to assemble a global ‘wiring diagram of cellular function’ (Costanzo et al., 2016). Alternatively, specific types of genetic interaction such as synthetic lethal interactions can be used to identify drug targets for diseases including cancer (Kaelin, 2005).

The strategy we have followed to overcome these hurdles relied on the efficient selection of SLC26 homologs with superior biochemical properties and the use of antibodies as crystallization chaperones (Geertsma et al., 2015). The procedures described here do not greatly deviate from those of colleagues, but on a few points we do follow alternative approaches. For example, for protein production we make use of the araBAD promoter (Guzman et al., 1995) and not the popular T7 promoter (Studier et al., 1990). In contrast to the T7 promoter, the PBAD promoter allows direct tuning of the protein production levels and its adjustment to the capacity of the downstream folding machinery, thereby reducing the formation of inclusion bodies (Geertsma et al., 2008). Furthermore, we prefer nanobodies, the variable domain of camelid heavy chain only antibodies (Pardon et al., 2014), as crystallization chaperones over the more commonly used Fabs. In our hands, the generation, selection, and production of nanobodies is far more robust and straightforward. Though we are aware that alternative protein production strategies (Henderson et al., 2000; Kunji et al., 2003; Miroux and Walker, 1996; Studier, 2005; Wagner et al., 2008) and crystallization chaperones (Koide, 2009; Seeger et al., 2013) exist, we did not explore these as the presented procedures proved very robust and successful.

This protocol provides a method to measure ion channel or transporter currents expressed in oocytes, including plant ion channels.

Bio-protocol-3018	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2113	Assay to Access Anthelmintic Activity of Small Molecule Drugs Using Caenohabidtis elegans as a Model	C. elegans, Nematodes, Anthelmintic drugs, Chemotherapy Background Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for parasite nematode research and an excellent system for the screening of compounds with potential anthelmintic activity, because it is inexpensive, readily available, and easy to work with. In addition, the use of C. elegans in assays to investigate nematode behavior, locomotion, reproduction and death is uncomplicated and reliable (Simpkin and Coles, 1981). The protocols for screening new compounds on C. elegans were first carried out in axenic liquid medium in deep well microscope slides (Tomlinson et al., 1985) or using the drugs added to melted modified NGM agar (Driscoll et al., 1989). These methods are not effective in drug screening as axenic cultures, containing low food supply, trigger the intra-uterine birth causing maternal death (endotokia matricida) (Lenaerts et al., 2008) and drugs added to melted agar can modify drug stability due to the high temperatures. In this protocol, we used 96-well plates with liquid medium supplied with Escherichia coli to evaluate each stage (eggs, L1-L2 larvae, L3-L4 larvae and adults) independently.

However, there are a number of critical steps AAV must successfully navigate before it reaches the nucleus and transduces the cell. Therefore, there are multiple distinct steps in the AAV infectious pathway that could be disrupted individually or collectively, leading to altered transduction. Assessment of AAV binding and internalization are important first steps in determining the cause of transduction differences observed upon cellular modification by small molecules, CRISPR-based gene knockout, siRNA-based gene knockdown, or other experimental procedures.

Blastema transplantation developed in our studies is an efficient method for introducing mesenchymal donor cells into host fin ray. It enables us to track cell fate and/or manipulate cell signaling such as fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) during fish fin regeneration. Actually, in our recently published work, we transplanted blastema cells, which carried the hsp70l:dominant-negative fgf receptor and the  -actin:dsRed2 transgenes, into a wild-type blastema region and mosaically inhibited Fgf signaling in a subset of fin ray mesenchymal cells (Shibata et al., 2016). This method is applicable for analyzing other cell signals and for tracking cell fate by live cell imaging.

Bio-protocol-3027	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2104	In vitro Floral Induction of Cuscuta reflexa	Cuscuta reflexa, in vitro, Floral induction, NAA, 2,4-D Background Cuscuta reflexa is a parasitic angiosperm parasitizing on a huge number of angiosperms (Kuijt, 1969). The ability to cause severe damage and loss of yield in the host plant has made this species important for scientific study (Nun and Mayer, 1999). Most of the Cuscuta species are non chloroplastic except few which have functional chloroplasts (Hibberd et al., 1998). Development of seedlings from larger embryos of C. reflexa in white’s medium has been reported (Maheshweri and Baldev, 1961). Floral induction of C. reflexa in short day period as well as dark conditions has been seen in vitro (Baldev, 1962). In vitro floral induction of Cuscuta japonica in short day conditions has also been established by Furuhashi et al. (1991).

Cryopreservation allows for batching of samples, which is convenient and improves the comparability of data. Cryopreservation also allows cells to be stored for unknown future purposes. Because erythrocytes and granulocytes are much more fragile to freezing and thawing, PBMC isolation is a common prerequisite to cryopreservation of blood cells; and the most common method for PBMC isolation is density gradient centrifugation using FicollHypaque, a high molecular weight carbohydrate solution.
Bio-protocol-3029	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2102	An Acute Mouse Spinal Cord Slice Preparation for Studying Glial Activation ex vivo	Microglia, Astrocyte, Spinal cord, Neuroinflammation, Spina cord slices Background Mouse transgenic technology has been used to model different human pathologies affecting the spinal cord, many of which are characterized by local glial activation, one hallmark of neuroinflammation. A major breakthrough that has enormously increased the understanding of glial biology in health and disease is the utilization of laser scanning microscopy based techniques, such as confocal microscopy (White et al., 1987) and two-photon microscopy (Denk et al., 1990) to visualize cell structures and subcellular domains in living animals in a noninvasive fashion; for example, mice expressing genetically encoded reporters or calcium sensors have been used to image glial structures (somata and processes) and to study calcium dynamics and signaling, respectively (Davalos et al., 2005; Gee et al., 2014). In spinal cord, myelin is highly compact in the white matter of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi. In vivo structural imaging of glial cells and infiltrating immune cells has been successfully performed in the past using surgical procedures (laminectomy) that allow optical access to the dorsal spinal cord (Kim et al., 2010). However, since myelin greatly increases light scattering, imaging is limited to the superficial layers of the dorsal funiculus, masking valuable information from deeper regions such as ventral horn. We think that acute slices prepared from wild type and transgenic mice can be used in combination with high-resolution imaging techniques to offer an alternative strategy to collect structural and functional information, in vitro, from dorsal, and also lateral and ventral regions. Coronal sections interrupt ascending and descending axons and many motor axons as well. Nevertheless, the information obtained is likely to be useful in analyzing how glial cells respond acutely to inflammatory challenges in spinal cord.
Bio-protocol-3030	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2101	Relative Stiffness Measurements of Cell-embedded Hydrogels by Shear Rheology in vitro	Shear rheology, Matrix stiffness, Cancer-associated fibroblasts, Hydrogels Background Fibrosis and solid tumours are both accompanied by pathological remodelling of their native tissue (Cox and Erler, 2011; Bonnans et al., 2014). In both pathological conditions, the local tissue environment experiences physico-chemical as well as biological changes, resulting in increased tissue stiffness (elastic modulus) (Humphrey et al., 2014). The strengthened tissue/matrix regulates mechanosignaling that leads to altered cell behaviour, cell morphology, differentiation state, proliferation, migration and stemness. In preclinical animal models of cancer, these changes can drive malignant progression and metastatic spread (Bonnans et al., 2014). Not surprisingly, targeting matrix stiffening has received substantial attention in recent years, and several clinical trials have been initiated (Kai et al., 2016).

This protocol was mainly based on previously described methods (Hu et al., 2003; Hugel and Schlichter, 2000). Here we made  a  few  modifications  including  reagents,  recipes,  dissection  and  described  step-by-step procedures of the dissection and culture of primary SDHN from newborn mice. In this protocol, neurons were gained using the enzymatic (papain) digestion method from fresh spinal dorsal horn tissues directly. The culture of SDHN in vitro can be used for further experiments, such as electrophysiological recordings, immunocytochemistry, and  C a^2+ imaging, which better support cell behaviors in the spinal cord.

The rotational speed of the proton-driven flagellar motor is proportional to total PMF (Gabel and Berg, 2003). Therefore, measurements of free-swimming speeds of motile cells allow us not only to analyze motor performance of various mutants but also to examine whether there is a significant difference in total PMF under experimental conditions (Minamino et al., 2016).

Bio-protocol-3042	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2089	Ex vivo Culture of Fetal Mouse Gastric Epithelial Progenitors	ex vivo, Spheroids, Mouse fetal epithelium, Progenitors, 3D, Single cells Background Mouse adult stem cells from the glandular stomach can be grown ex vivo in a 3D matrigel as ‘mini-glands’ for indefinite periods of time (Barker et al., 2010). As compared to stem cells from the small intestine growing in presence of EGF, Noggin and R-spondin 1, adult gastric stem cells need to be further supplemented with Fgf10, Gastrin, Wnt3a and a higher concentration of R-spondin 1 to get productive long-term cultures. In contrast, little was known till recently about the fetal cells that line the pre-glandular epithelium during development. So far, their nature as well as their potential growth properties ex vivo were uncharacterized. Based on the previous study identifying the cells present in the fetal small intestine (Mustata et al., 2013), we report on the culture of mouse fetal gastric progenitors as spheroids (Fernandez Vallone et al., 2016). Gastric progenitors can be replated in the culture medium previously reported by Sato et al., 2009 to grow small intestinal adult stem cells and, contrary to adulttype gastric stem cells, they do not need extra growth factors supplementation (Fgf10, Wnt3a or Gastrin).
Bio-protocol-3043	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2088	Ex vivo Culture of Adult Mouse Antral Glands	ex vivo, Murine gastric epithelium, Antral glands, Gastric organoids, 3D, Single cell Background Mouse adult stem cells from the glandular stomach can be grown ex vivo in a 3D matrigel as ‘mini-glands’ for indefinite periods of time (Barker et al., 2010). As compared to stem cells from the mouse adult small intestine growing in presence of EGF, Noggin and R-spondin 1, gastric stem cells need to be further supplemented with Fgf10, Gastrin, Wnt3a and a higher concentration of R-spondin 1 (referred to as ENRFGW) to get productive cultures. Till recently, whether, and if so how, adult regenerating antral glands grow in the ex vivo culture system following stem cell ablation, remained unknown. Using the present protocol, it was demonstrated that homeostatic and regenerating antral glands do not grow similarly upon seeding and exhibit different growth culture requirements.
Bio-protocol-3044	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2087	Examination of the Interaction between a Membrane Active Peptide and Artificial Bilayers by Dual Polarisation Interferometry	Membrane interaction, Bilayer, Peptide, Kinetics, Lipid order, Protein-lipid interaction Background The search for and development of new drugs to effectively treat resistant infections is a serious challenge. One group of molecules, the antimicrobial peptides, shows promise as effective new therapeutics due to their range of activity against bacterial, fungal and cancer cells (Mader and Hoskin, 2006; van der Weerden et al., 2013). The cell killing ability of antimicrobial peptides often involves interaction with the membrane (Brogden, 2005; Zasloff, 2002). To develop these peptides as effective therapeutics we need to understand the nature of the interaction of the peptide with the cell membrane and why this interaction results in cell death. That is, we need to know the full sequence of events that occurs between the peptide and the membrane in real time; from the initial electrostatic interaction of the peptide with the bilayer, to phospholipid selectivity, to final disruption of the membrane including changes in lipid order.

Bio-protocol-3047	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2084	Fluorescence in situ Localization of Gene Expression Using a lacZ Reporter in the Heterocyst-forming Cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis	-galactosidase, in situ localization, Heterocysts, Cyanobacteria, lacZ reporter Background Anabaena variabilis is a filamentous cyanobacterium that differentiates specialized cells called heterocysts that function specifically for nitrogen fixation (Kumar et al., 2010; Maldener and MuroPastor, 2010). We use the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli as a transcriptional reporter of cyanobacterial gene expression because of the ease of a quantitative, enzymatic, colorimetric,  -galactosidase assay in 96-well plates (Griffith and Wolf, 2002) and the ability to use the same strain for in situ localization of gene  expression  using  the  fluorescent  substrate  5-dodecanolyaminofluorescein  di-  -Dgalactopyranoside (C12-FDG) (Thiel et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2016). One of the earliest reports of lacZ as a reporter was the fusion of malF, encoding the maltose transporter, to lacZ, which resulted in localization of  -galactosidase activity to the cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli (Silhavy et al., 1976). Since then lacZ has been used as a reporter in bacterial, plant and animal systems; e.g., the stable transfection of mouse tumor cells with lacZ allowed single cell histochemical staining using the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-  -D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) (Arlt et al., 2012). In fact, most cellular localization of expression of lacZ has used X-gal, which is relatively inexpensive, easy to use and provides an easy visual screen. Our initial attempts to use X-gal and other chromogenic substrates in Anabaena were unsuccessful because the colored products were toxic to cyanobacteria and often resulted in cell lysis. In addition, the cyanobacterial pigments, including chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and carotenoids, made color detection difficult. We also attempted to use the fluorescent substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone  -D-galactopyranoside, whose product, 4-methylumbelliferone, emits in the blue range; however, we were not able to detect fluorescence over the background fluorescence of the cells. Finally we tried fluorescein  -D-galactopyranoside (FDG), a very sensitive fluorogenic substrate for  -galactosidase. FDG, which is not fluorescent, is hydrolyzed in two steps by  - galactosidase, first to fluorescein monogalactoside and then to fluorescein. We modified the method developed to visualize lacZ expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (Bylund et al., 1994; Chung et al., 1995). That protocol specified 5-octanolyaminofluorescein di-  -D-galactopyranoside (C8-FDG); however  we  had  poor  results  with  C8-FDG,  so  we  tried  the  more  lipophilic  5- dodecanolyaminofluorescein di-  -D-galactopyranoside (C12-FDG) (Miao et al., 1993; Plovins et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1991), which has 12 carbons added to the fluorescein in FDG. C12-FDG proved to function well in cyanobacteria. Using C12-FDG we have been able to easily visualize heterocyst-specific expression of genes, such as cnfR1, the activator of the nitrogenase genes in heterocysts (Pratte and Thiel, 2016), fused to lacZ (Figure 1).

Further, the specific linkage of dimer can be determined by using different Ub mutants.
Bio-protocol-3050	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2081	Measuring Procaspase-8 and -10 Processing upon Apoptosis Induction	Caspase-8, Cleavage, Proteolysis, Western blot, Apoptosis, Cell death Background Caspases are proteases that are produced as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolytic cleavage (Degterev et al., 2003). The activation of the caspase cascade is the most important event during apoptotic cell death, which induces the typical biochemical and morphological changes of the apoptotic cell. In contrast to inactive executioner procaspases, the initiator procaspases 8/9/10 have restricted proteolytic activity and become fully activated in high molecular weight complexes (Lavrik et al., 2005). Procaspase-9 is activated at the platform termed apoptosome during intrinsic apoptosis, while stimulation of the death receptors TNF-R1 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1), CD95/Fas (Cluster of Differentiation 95), TRAIL-R1 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand Receptor 1), TRAIL-R2 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand Receptor 2) leads to the recruitment of procaspases-8 and -10 with adapter proteins to form the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) during extrinsic apoptosis (Schleich et al., 2012). Here, caspases-8 and -10 enter close proximity and perform several intra- and inter-molecular cleavages. This processing results in the release of a small and a large subunit from the prodomain. These form the active heterotetramers p18_2p10_2 and p17_2p12_2 that triggers the caspase cascade leading to the demolition of the cell (see Figures 1A and 1B).

For samples that yield low mRNA levels, RNA or cDNA amplification was commonly performed before deepsequencing (Dutta et al., 2015). However, this procedure could potentially omit important candidates that are expressed in low abundance. Here we provide a detailed procedure for RNA-seq analysis of sorted Drosophila gut cells in which RNA amplification is not required.

We describe here two feasible and economic solutions to detect apoptotic and necrotic cell death by flow cytometry (FCM). DAPI labels cells with disrupted integrity (necrosis), while Annexin  binds to phosphatidylserine (which is externalized upon apoptosis). DiOC6(3) uptake indicates mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) and the collapse of MTP reveals apoptosis. DAPI doesn’t require compensation with phycoerythrin (PE, which is conjugated with Annexin V protein) or DiOC6(3), and therefore show advantage over propidium iodide (PI) in these assays.

Adequate balance between quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation is necessary to sustain an appropriate number of undifferentiated stem cells and to avoid premature stem cell exhaustion for the homeostasis of many tissues (Tseng et al., 2015; Wabik and Jones, 2015; Xin et al., 2016). Infertility has become an increasing problem for human couples and a significant portion of male-related infertility cases results from impaired undifferentiated spermatogonia (Boivin et al., 2007; Matzuk and Lamb, 2008). For this reason, SSCs in spermatogenesis, which is a well-characterized stem cell-dependent process (Oatley and Brinster, 2008), is a valuable model to study regulation of tissue homeostasis. Numerous studies have developed germ cell isolation methods in order to gain insight into the biological functions and regulatory networks of undifferentiated spermatogonia. However, in vivo undifferentiated spermatogonia are heterogeneous in their expression of markers including GFRA1, ID4, PLZF and

PCC6803	Cyanobacteria, Cell wall, Deg proteases, Antibiotics Background The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (hereafter, Synechocystis 6803) is a model organism for studying the process of photosynthesis. While its genome was sequenced already in 1996, still more than 50% of its genes encode proteins with hypothetical or unknown function. The three genes slr1204 (htrA), sll1679 (hhoA) and sll1427 (hhoB) encode serine proteases of the Deg (degradation of periplasmic proteins) family; despite detailed analyses (see Cheregi et al., 2016 and references therein) their exact subcellular localization and substrates still are enigmatic. Previous proteomic and metabolomic characterizations of single and triple deg deletion mutants performed in our lab have shown altered expression of proteins with functions in or on the outer cell layers of Synechocystis 6803 (Miranda et al., 2013; Tam et al., 2015; Cheregi et al., 2015).

These include laser ablation (Ratheesh et al., 2012; Smutny et al., 2015; Michael et al., 2016), optical tweezers (Bambardekar et al., 2015), FRET tension sensors (Grashoff et al., 2010; Borghi et al., 2012; Conway et al., 2013; Leerberg et al., 2014) and immunofluorescence for protein epitopes that are revealed under tension (Yonemura et al., 2010). Among these, laser ablation has become the most popular method, as it is easy to implement and provide a direct measurement of mechanical tension compared with other methods (e.g., FRET or immunofluorescence where the evidence for mechanical tension is more indirect). However, special considerations need to be taken to set up these experiments as well as its analysis, which are important for the correct interpretation of results. This protocol, provides the basic steps needed for the setup and optimization of laser ablation experiments in confluent monolayers of epithelial cells as well as a complete description of the image analysis procedure for measurements of initial recoil after ablation, which is an index of junctional tension.

This protocol focused on, not only localising the proteins of interest but also the molecular structures that were in surrounding tissue. It is believed that the mature sieve elements are enucleated and have abundant callose deposition within the sieve plate. Therefore, counterstaining procedures were applied in order to represent these biological phenomena. As the proteins of interest in this study were also thought to be localised within the apoplast further counterstaining was applied showing colabelling of the protein and the cell wall.

Cellular oxygen consumption is highly recognized as a fundamental indicator of mitochondrial function, reflecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic activity of the cell. Therefore, several methods have been developed to measure oxygen consumption rates in cells or entire organisms (Dranka et al., 2011; Li and Graham, 2012; Luz et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2013). These approaches provided insight into the pivotal roles of mitochondria in disease progression and pathogenesis (Scheibye-Knudsen et al., 2015). In this protocol, we describe a method for the determination of oxygen consumption rates in the nematode C. elegans by using a Clark-type polarographic oxygen sensor electrode (Hansatech, King’s Lynn, England).

Larger elastic arteries, such as the aorta, have multiple concentric lamellae consisting of aligned smooth muscle cells sandwiched between elastin fibers. The elastin and collagen present within the medial layer of elastic arteries allow it to distribute the force generated by the heart throughout the vessel wall (Wagenseil and Mecham, 2009). Smaller muscular arteries, by contrast, have only an internal and external elastic lamina bounding the smooth muscle layer. These arteries are downstream in the arterial tree and thus bear less force from blood flow.

In contrast to mammals, injury response in zebrafish cord is quite different, resulting in repair and regeneration of cord followed by functional recovery. A variety of lesioning protocols have been employed to study spinal cord injury and functional recovery in lower vertebrates (Holtzer 1956; Egar and Singer, 1972; Filoni et al., 1984; Becker et al., 1997; Margotta et al., 1991; Hui et al., 2010; Sîrbulescu and Zupanc, 2011) in last five decades. Among them the most popular experimental protocol to study spinal cord regeneration has been tail amputation (Holtzer, 1956; Egar and Singer, 1972; Filoni et al., 1984; Margotta et al., 1991; Sîrbulescu and Zupanc, 2011). Tail amputation involves complete removal of the caudal part of tail, where muscle, skin, bone and cartilages are also removed along with spinal cord. There is complete regeneration of tail along with the spinal cord leading to functional recovery after tail amputation and a substantial progress has been made to understand the cellular mechanism of spinal cord regeneration. But there are drawbacks of using this model. The major criticism against this model is that, it does not appropriately mimic SCI in human, since there is no tail structure in humans and the nature of the injury is different.
Bio-protocol-3089	https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2042	Pyocyanin Extraction and Quantitative Analysis in Swarming Pseudomonas aeruginosa Michelle M. King, Manita Guragain, Svetlana A. Sarkisova, and Marianna A. Patrauchan*	Pyocyanin, Swarming, P. aeruginosa, Chloroform extraction, Virulence factor, Motility Background Pyocyanin is a blue redox-active phenazine pigment produced by a human pathogen, P. aeruginosa. Pyocyanin is present in large quantities in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients infected by P. aeruginosa (Wilson et al., 1988) and plays a major role in the virulence of the pathogen (Lau et al., 2004). Pyocyanin production is regulated by quorum sensing, which involves a cell-density-dependent synthesis of signal molecules that modulate the expression of virulence genes (Fuqua et al., 2001). Swarming is a complex communal behavior developing in response to multiple environmental signals and enabling cell motility on a semi-solid surface and colonization of host tissues. Our earlier observations suggested that pyocyanin production in liquid cultures of P. aeruginosa differ significantly from that in swarming colonies, likely due to quorum sensing regulation. Therefore, we developed a protocol allowing extraction and quantification of pyocyanin secreted by swarming cells into the surrounding agar. The obtained quantities are normalized by total cellular protein extracted from the swarming cells. This protocol differs from commonly used quantification of pyocyanin extracted from liquid cultures (Frank and Demoss, 1959) cells scrapped from a solid agar surface (De Vleesschauwer et al., 2006), or agar itself, but without normalization per total cell protein (Gallagher and Manoil, 2001). Normalized quantification of pyocyanin from swarming colonies allows studying the regulation of pyocyanin production and secretion during swarming, which is an essential component of P. aeruginosa adaptation to a host environment.

These synthetic enveloped viruses are derived from a parental virus, usually a rhabdovirus or a retrovirus, which forms the core of the particle that can incorporate in its membrane a wide range of viral envelope glycoproteins from heterologous viruses. Several model viruses such as the retroviral murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or the rhabdoviral vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been successfully used to generate viral pseudotyped particles (also named pseudoviruses or pseudovirions). Virus pseudotyping is particularly useful for the following scenarios: (i) to quantify the viral entry process of enveloped viruses using reporter genes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, (ii) to study host cell entry of enveloped viruses that cannot be cultivated in cell culture, (iii) to study entry pathways of risk group (RG) 3 or 4 viral pathogens when biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities are not available, (iv) to generate cells stably expressing a specific gene of interest or for specific gene silencing, (v) to produce vectors for gene delivery allowing control over cell tropism. Pseudotyped particles can be used to complement native virus infection assays, especially regarding study of virus entry events.

In a recent study, we showed that a unicellular red alga C. melorae accumulates ABA in response to salt stress by the present protocol. This is the detail of the first published protocol for the extraction and quantification of ABA from C. merolae. This protocol is optimized for C. merolae based on the land plant protocol.

Kuntze (Araucariaceae)	Somatic embryogenesis, Size, Sedimented cell volume Background Silveira et al. (2006) used SCV measurements to analyze the effects of exogenous polyamines on the morphological changes of A. angustifolia PEMs and Osti et al. (2010) tested the effect of different nitric oxide donors on cellular growth and PEM morphology. Recently, Douétts-Peres et al. (2016) studied the effect of a cellular growth inhibitor on cellular growth and PEM morphology using SCV, fresh and dry weight, PEM area, and individual diameters of embryogenic-type cells, including the length and width of the suspensor-type cells. In addition, alterations to cellular growth and morphology in response to endogenous compounds, such as polyamines, nitric oxide and specific proteins have been evaluated using this method (Silveira et al., 2006; Osti et al., 2010; Douétts-Peres et al., 2016).

Usually most plants absorb nitrogen mainly in the form of nitrate grown under aerobic conditions (Xu et al., 2016). To determine the nitrate accumulation in plants, we need to test the nitrate content in different tissues of plants. There are some methods for determination of nitrate, for example, potentiometric method (Carlson and Keeney, 1971), phenoldisulfonic acid method (Bremner, 1965), Cadium reduction (Huffman and Barbarick, 1981) and other methods. These methods have some disadvantages, such as lower sensitivity, interferences, technician exposure to carcinogenic chemicals (Cataldo et al., 1975; Vendrell and Zupancic, 1990)
