Here we describe an in vitro kinase assay in which ERK3 transfers radiolabeled gamma-phosphate from γ- ^32P -ATP to a purified protein substrate. Excess radiolabeled ATP is then separated from the radiolabeled substrate by gel electrophoresis. The amount of phosphorylated substrate can be quantified by autoradiography, phosphorimaging, or liquid scintillation counting techniques. Radioactive kinase assay provides a direct measurement of kinase activity. It is sensitive, quick, inexpensive, and considered as the 'gold standard' for quantification of protein kinase activity. The major limitations of radioactive kinase assays are the hazards of handling radiolabeled isotopes and unsuitability of this assay format for large scale high-throughput screening."}

Current efforts to develop therapies for organ fibrosis have focused on pathologic fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts (Blackwell et al., 2014). In addition to secretion of matrix proteins such as collagen, which comprise scar, a hallmark of pathologic fibroblasts is their increased proliferative and migratory capacity (Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick, 2014). A number of studies have shown that innate immune cells interact with and mediate fibroblast activation (Desai et al., 2018). Thus, we investigated the effects of lung macrophages on fibroblasts in a recent study, where we found a novel population of macrophages that localizes to fibrotic scar in murine lung (Aran et al., 2019). These macrophages highly expressed PDGF-AA, a secreted factor known for promoting fibroblast migration and proliferation. Thus, we treated mouse 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts with conditioned media from cultured mouse lung macrophages, with and without PDGF-AA blocking antibody, and measured fibroblast gap closure."}

Most CpG dinucleotides in the genome are methylated, including those located in gene regulatory regions such as enhancers. However, when required, these CpGs can be demethylated through oxidation of the methyl group by Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes and replacement by unmethylated cytosines by the base excision repair system. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the first oxidative derivative of 5-methylcytosine, and mapping this modified base in the genome provides information on the regions undergoing active demethylation. Although selective chemical labeling (SCL) allows very specific detection of 5hmC, the resolution of this technique is limited by the size of the DNA fragments, especially when several CpGs are present in the captured DNA. In order to improve resolution, we have introduced a digestion step using exonucleases which trim the DNA molecule up to close proximity of the hydroxymethylated cytosines (Sérandour et al., 2016). Appropriate bioinformatic treatment of the sequencing reads then assigns hydroxymethylation score to the captured CpGs."}

Generally, the diameter of muscle fiber and the extent of adipocytes and fibrotic area are associated with muscle strength (Yue et al., 2016). In addition, the presence of central nucleated muscle fibers serves as a surrogate indicator of newly regenerated muscle fibers during muscle regeneration (Wang et al., 2017). Based on the differential metabolic traits and the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) subtypes, myofibers are classified into four types (I, IIa, IIx and IIb).

Here we report a simple, widely applicable and optimized protocol for PV production by using the Endofectin LentiTM transfection reagent in 6-well plate format, and the methodology to perform an ELLA assay with the resulting influenza pseudotypes. While PV production for HA-based assays has made use of the lentiviral genome containing a reporter gene, the ELLA assay utilizes solely the surface NA glycoprotein, rendering a PV-incorporated reporter irrelevant to this protocol. The original ELLA assay from 1990 was recently improved (Couzens et al., 2014). This assay enables the detection of exposed galactose residues resulting from the enzymatic action of NA on sialic acids present on the fetuin substrate. This assay allows the measurement of NA inhibiting antibodies, through detection of a drop in enzymatic NA activity. The ELLA overcomes the limits of the cumbersome thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA) that employs hazardous materials, allowing for large-scale screening of serum samples. The basis of the assay is simple, 96-well plates are coated in the carbohydrate fetuin, which is then exposed to NA through NA bearing PV. The NA enzyme cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from the fetuin, exposing galactose that is then bound by the peanut agglutinin from Arachis hypogeal, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PNA-HRPO). This reagent then forms the basis for colorimetric reading of NA activity by a spectrophotometer. This activity can then be knocked down using an inhibitor (such as antibodies found in human sera) in subsequent assays. The described protocol combines the ability to screen a large number of sera through the ELLA assay, with a simple and safe lentiviral pseudotype production protocol. NA targeting antibodies are typically neglected in current influenza vaccines (compared to HA targeting antibodies), despite being shown to limit influenza symptoms and transmission (Marcelin et al., 2011 and 2012; Wohlbold and Krammer, 2014)."}

They exercise innate immune functions in numerous ways: by secreting cytokines and chemokines, acting through complement signaling pathways, and phagocytosing pathogens and debris. The extent of macrophage activation can tip the balance of immune response within the body during health and disease. In diseases such as cancer, the activation of monocytic cells can result in either pro- or anti- tumoral responses, which trigger different disease outcomes. Similarly, monocytic cells modulate the progression and remission of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Moreover, these viruses have been described as potential virulence factors (Fichorova et al., 2013; El-Gayar et al., 2016; Rath et al., 2019). Of particular note, the presence of the endosymbiont Leishmania RNA virus (LRV), a Totiviridae double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, in Leishmania guyanensis (Lgy) exacerbates leishmaniasis disease (Ives et al., 2011; Rossi et al., 2017), favors metastasis by inducing interleukin17 (Hartley et al., 2016) and also increases the risk of treatment failure (Adaui et al., 2016; Bourreau et al., 2016; Vieira-Gonçalves et al., 2019). This shows the importance of viral dsRNA detection in parasites. The technique presented here is sequence-independent, in comparison to quantitative real-time PCR, so it can be applied widely to RNA viruses. This dsRNA detection protocol can also, and is recommended, to be used to confirm (or be confirmed with) other methods of detection that are sequence-independent or -dependent, as for example dot blot or PCR (Zangger et al., 2013). The technique is presented here with LRV, however its application is possible for other RNA viruses and in other parasites (Grybchuk et al., 2018)."}

Since then, a vast majority of the existing information about the physiological and molecular processes surrounding capacitation was obtained using in vitro systems, which were first used in the 1970s for the conception of the first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Steptoe and Edwards, 1976). Nowadays, up to 10% of children in developed countries are conceived by assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). With this development, there is an even greater need to obtain detailed knowledge about the natural capacitation process and to understand its differences from in vitro capacitation. This protocol enables researchers to study the molecular features of sperm at the different stages of the capacitation process by isolating sperm from different locations along the reproductive tract (UTJ, isthmus, and ampulla) of time-mated female mice. This protocol can also be applied to recover freshly ejaculated sperm from mice (Li et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2017) as epididymal sperm are normally used for mouse experiments, as opposed to ejaculate sperm for large domestic animals or humans."}

It enables us to track cell fate and/or manipulate cell signaling such as fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) during fish fin regeneration. Actually, in our recently published work, we transplanted blastema cells, which carried the hsp70l:dominant-negative fgf receptor and the -actin:dsRed2 transgenes, into a wild-type blastema region and mosaically inhibited Fgf signaling in a subset of fin ray mesenchymal cells (Shibata et al., 2016).

Since then, it has been extensively studied because of the simple anatomy, the easy cultivation, and the rapid growth. The reproductive life cycle of C. elegans, which takes only three days, consists of the embryonic stage, four larval stages (L1-L4), and the adult stage. After 14~h~ of embryogenesis, C. elegans grows in size during the four larval stages which are divided by each molt, then it reaches the adult stage which can produce the next generation. In unfavorable conditions, C. elegans larvae can choose the alternative developmental pathway, so-called “dauer”, which can survive a few months in the adverse conditions. When the environment becomes favorable, C. elegans exits the dauer stage and develops into the L4 stage."}

The C-terminal half of the ubiquitin moiety (Cub) is linked with the transcription reporter complex PLV (Protein A-LexA-VP16). The fusion of two proteins (X and Y) to NubG and CubPLV, respectively, yields a system for protein-protein interaction analysis. After transformation, the yeast strain THY.AP5 contains the NubG-X fusion protein, while yeast strain THY.AP4 contains the Y-CubPLV fusion protein. After mating, in the diploid yeast, if proteins X and Y interact with each other, a functional ubiquitin will be reassembled which leads to cleavage of the PLV.

In recent years, a variety of methods have been developed based on organic solvents, water-based non-gels, and hydrogels (Ertürk et al., 2011; Chung and Deisseroth, 2013; Ke et al., 2013); however, both the CLARITY and 3DISCO protocols are associated with significant drawbacks: 3DISCO loses endogenous protein fluorescence and involves toxic and flammable substances (Matsumoto et al., 2019), while CLARITY relies on dedicated equipment for electrophoresis. In addition, acrylamide has carcinogenicity and toxicity in its aqueous form (Hogervorst et al., 2007). Compared with these other brain-clearing techniques, CUBIC is safe, simple to operate, and efficiently achieves transparency. This method clears fixed brain samples in a few days to render the brain transparent, thus meeting the quality requirements of optical imaging of the sample. Using the standard CUBIC tissue clearing procedure, we subject mouse brain samples to transcardial perfusion, clearing, immersion in antibody solution, and refractive index matching. The aminoalcohol used can effectively remove hemochrome from hemoglobin and myoglobin, which not only reduces light scattering but also lessens the absorption of light to achieve further decolorization and transparency. When combined with rotating-disc confocal microscopy, CUBIC facilitates comprehensive and quantitative analyses for understanding the brain structure on the millimeter-scale level. It boasts a simple clearance procedure (Muntifering et al., 2018), excellent clearance effect in a short time frame (approximately 11 days) (Wan et al., 2018), and outstanding fluorescence preservation (Tainaka et al., 2018), making it a popular option among research labs."}

By cooling down the sample at a high enough freezing rate (10^4-10^5^°C/s e c) , its contained water molecules cannot reorganize in a crystal-fashion and remain vitrified in an amorphous state (see Dubochet 2007 for further reading on the physics behind water crystallization). The sample is then said to be ‘cryoimmobilized’ or ‘vitrified’. This is generally achieved by the use of liquid nitrogen (-195^°C) or liquid ethane (-188^°C) . At ambient pressure, this phenomenon can only be achieved on a few microns ( <5 microns), however by raising the pressure to approximately 2,000 bars (2,000 atmospheres), this depth can reach at least 200 microns (up to 500 microns in certain conditions). This allows the vitrification of thick biological tissues without any osmotic artefacts."}

For example, proteins and oligonucleotides adopt structures that provide interaction sites or binding pockets for metal ions, organic ligands, and other oligonucleotides or proteins. Upon complex formation, the structure of the biomacromolecule may change, and it is this structural change that is the basis for function; thus, methods are needed that enable resolution of the structures along the trajectory of the conformational change. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electron microscopy (EM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical trap, and magnetic tweezers are powerful methods for obtaining the structures of biomolecules at atomic resolution (Salas et al., 2015; Lottspeich and Engels, 2018; Geffroy et al., 2018); yet, they also have their limitations. X-ray crystallography requires the biomolecule to be crystallized and is, as EM, limited in providing information on dynamics and conformational intermediates. NMR spectroscopy can follow the dynamics of biomolecules since it is performed in liquid solution, but is limited with respect to the size of the biomolecule. Complementary to these techniques, fluorescence microscopy (FM), Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are biophysical methods that allow resolution of the dynamics of structural changes without size restriction and in solution (Yang et al., 2012; Lottspeich and Engels,"}

The strategy we have followed to overcome these hurdles relied on the efficient selection of SLC26 homologs with superior biochemical properties and the use of antibodies as crystallization chaperones (Geertsma et al., 2015). The procedures described here do not greatly deviate from those of colleagues, but on a few points we do follow alternative approaches. For example, for protein production we make use of the araBAD promoter (Guzman et al., 1995) and not the popular T7 promoter (Studier et al., 1990). In contrast to the T7 promoter, the PBAD promoter allows direct tuning of the protein production levels and its adjustment to the capacity of the downstream folding machinery, thereby reducing the formation of inclusion bodies (Geertsma et al., 2008). Furthermore, we prefer nanobodies, the variable domain of camelid heavy chain only antibodies (Pardon et al., 2014), as crystallization chaperones over the more commonly used Fabs. In our hands, the generation, selection, and production of nanobodies is far more robust and straightforward. Though we are aware that alternative protein production strategies (Henderson et al., 2000; Kunji et al., 2003; Miroux and Walker, 1996; Studier, 2005; Wagner et al., 2008) and crystallization chaperones (Koide, 2009; Seeger et al., 2013) exist, we did not explore these as the presented procedures proved very robust and successful."}

In response to a hypoxic microenvironment, tumor cells overexpress Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF), a family of heterodimeric transcription factors (Semenza, 2002; Brat and Van Meir, 2004; Kaur et al., 2005). HIFs bind to p300, a transcriptional coactivator, to form a complex that induces HIF target genes, thereby activating the hypoxia response pathway and promoting tumor growth (Kasper and Brindle, 2006; Liu, 2008). The binding domains involved with the HIF/p300 proteinprotein interface are the cysteine-histidine-rich region 1 (CH1) domain of p300 and the C-terminal activating domain (CAD) of HIF-1α (Dames et al., 2002; Freedman et al., 2002). The hypoxia response pathway facilitates tumor growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Inhibiting this pathway is a goal for targeted anti-cancer therapy (Post et al., 2004; Belozerov and Van Meir, 2006; Mooring, 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Mun et al., 2012; Wilkins et al., 2016). Small molecule compounds have recently been developed to bind to p300-CH1 and inhibit p300/HIF complexation, inhibiting the hypoxia response pathway and reducing tumor growth (Shi et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2012; Burroughs et al., 2013)."}

Different tissues contain different amounts of the components that contribute to both viscosity (e.g., hyaluronic acid) and elasticity (e.g., collagen fibers), and their structure and proportion change during pathological processes. The widespread use of elastomers or hydrogels as substrates for cell culture (Pelham and Wang, 1997) has revealed the strong impact of substrate mechanics on cell structure and function and focused attention on the limited view of cell biology derived from studies of cells on traditional glass or plastic substrates (Janmey et al., 2020). Until recently, studies of cellular response to substrate or matrix stiffness only examined how cells respond to elastic modulus alterations, with the viscous contribution being either neglected or uncontrolled. Theories of cell mechanosensing have also generally focused on the elastic resistance of the substrate. These limitations were largely due to the lack of suitable materials in which viscosity can be systematically varied within a viscoelastic substrate. There now exist three general approaches for introducing viscous dissipation in a viscoelastic substrate. In one, a polymerizing and crosslinking system, like a polyacrylamide gel, is designed to produce a network near the threshold of the sol-gel transition, such that there are significant elastic properties but also significant viscosity (Cameron et al., 2011). A second method forms crosslinked polymer networks with two classes of crosslinkers: one is covalent and static and the other is noncovalent and dynamic. These first two classes of material are viscoelastic fluids, or viscoplastic material, meaning that if subjected to constant stress, they can deform without limits, as the crosslinks or entanglements rearrange to minimize energy in the deformed state (Chaudhuri et al., 2016). The third class of material, which is the topic of this report, is viscoelastic solids. These materials dissipate substantial energy when they are deformed and slowly continue to deform in response to constant stress;"}

Natural silk fiber from Bombyx mori has to undergo a series of processing steps to become a regenerated liquid silk fibroin. The liquid silk can be easily made into various forms of silk biomaterials, such as micro- or nano-particles, regenerated fibers, artificial skin, and porous matrix or 3D scaffolds, biomimetic nanofibrous scaffolds, a platform for transistors and various classes of photonic devices. The structure and properties of the final forms of silk biomaterials depend evidently on the molecular size of the regenerated liquid silk which is affected by a series of processing steps including degumming and fibroin fiber dissolution. Our investigation showed that boiling and degumming in a 0.1%-0.5% Na2CO3 solution used most frequently in the laboratory can not only cause a large amount of sericin degradation and hydrolysis but also leads to serious breakage of the silk fibroin peptide chain and its mechanical properties decreasing (Wang and Zhang, 2013). The low purity, high concentration, and improper storage conditions easily induce regenerated liquid silk gelling or coagulating and denaturing. The partially chain-broken polypeptides of silk fibroin can be converted into silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs) in acetone (Zhang et al., 2007). During this process the molecular structure of the regenerated liquid silk has changed rapidly from random-coil and a-helix form (Silk I) into anti-parallel -sheet form (Silk II). The resulting crystalline silk nanoparticles may offer various possibilities for surface modification of industrial materials and enzyme/drug delivery system (Zhang et al., 2011)."}
