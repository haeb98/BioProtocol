Purification of pili usually involves mechanical shearing of pili from cells followed by precipitation. However, previous methods often result in low efficiency or unstable results due to pili retraction. This protocol presents an optimized method for purifying receptor type IV pili from Acinetobacter genomospecies I6(A. g p I6) , incorporating enhancements in shearing and collection steps to achieve high yields. We found that repeated passage through syringe needles increases yield, and temperature control is crucial during purification. Additionally, the CsCl density gradient was optimized specifically for this specific strain. The purified type IV pili are suitable for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and various biochemical experiments.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nBiological materials\n\n1.

Host bacteria culture# Day 1 afternoon1.  Recover A. gp16 (NCBI: txid70347) from -80^°C storage and place on ice.2. Using a sterile inoculation loop, obtain a small amount of bacteria from the thawed stock.3. Streak the loop across the surface of an LB agar plate using the quadrant streak method to gradually dilute the bacterial concentration.4.  Incubate the plate at 30~^°C overnight to allow colony formation. After incubation, select well-isolated single colonies for further analysis or experimentation (Figure 1A).()Host bacteria collection and pili shearingFigure 1. Host bacteria culture, collection, and pili shearing. (A) Pipeline for host bacteria inoculation and culture. (B) Pipeline for pili collection. L-shaped spreaders are used to gently scrape cells from the surface of the plate. The collected bacterial cell suspension is then passed through a syringe to further remove the pili, followed by vortexing.# Day 2 afternoon1.  Prepare 100LB agar plates without antibiotics (for use on Day 3).2.  Pick a single colony and inoculate it into 3mL of LB medium for overnight shaking at 30 ^°C .# Day 31.  In the morning (7 AM), take 100~uL from the 3~mL overnight culture and inoculate into 30~mL of LB medium. Incubate this A . gp16 cell culture with shaking at 200rpm at 30^°C until the culture reaches OD_600 =0.1 . Note: For different strains, the target OD600 may vary. For example, for E . coli, O D_600=0.6 is typical.2.  Add 100~uL of culture to each of the 100 prepared agar plates and spread evenly using a cell spreader. Option 1: 100 plates. Most are for large-scale purification. Option 2: 30 plates. For A. gp16 type IV pili, a smaller scale can also yield satisfactory results. Option 3: Six large 25cm×25cm ) LB medium plates. This requires increasing the inoculum to 1mL per plate. These larger plates reduce preparation time and simplify the procedure.3.  Incubate the plates at 30^°C for 30min to allow the surface to dry slightly.4.  For overnight incubation, the plates should be inverted (bottom up, lid down) to prevent accumulated humidity from dripping onto the surface, which could affect pili formation. (Overnight incubation typically takes about 16h . Deviating from this time frame may impact pili yield.)# (Option 1)# B.  Host bacteria collectionDay 41.  Pre-chill the dialysis buffer (1 L) at 4^°C .2.  Take out the overnight plates from 30^°C and immediately place them on ice. Process five plates at a time to prevent pili retraction at room temperature.3. Collect the bacterial cells from the plates using 300~uL of dialysis buffer with an L-shaped spreader, then collect the liquid from the plate surface using a 1~mL pipette into a 50mL Falcon tube. Note: For 25 c m×25 cm plates, use approximately 8 mL of dialysis buffer (Figure 1B).# C. Pili shearing and precipitation# Day 41.  Pass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili. Begin with the ^18G needle and then pass through the ^25G needle twice. Note: Thinner needles help shear the pili but may clog.2. Repeat the shearing process iteratively for all plates, processing 5–10 plates at a time. After shearing, vortex the liquid for 30 s (Figure 1B).3. Centrifuge the cell solution at _3,470× g for 30min at 4^°C to remove the cells. Note: If the solution remains unclear, repeat the centrifugation. Higher speeds (4,O O O-8,O O O× g) can also be used as long as the cells are adequately spun down.4.  Collect the pili from the supernatant using a pipette. If starting with 30 plates, concentrate the pili solution to 2-3~mL using centrifugation. For larger volume purification (100 plates), concentrate the pili solution to 8-10~mL .# (Option 2)For high-yield pili, such as A. g p l6 , this method is unnecessary. Sections B2 and C2 below can be used as an alternative method for pili purification of other low-yield species. It involves more steps and is relatively complicated. Refer to the general notes section for detailed explanations.# B2. Host bacteria collection (generalized method for all other kinds of pili purification) Day 41.  Pre-chill the SSC buffer at 4^°C .2.  Place the overnight plates on ice, processing five plates at a time to prevent pili retraction at room temperature.3.  Collect the bacterial cells from the plates using 500~uL of SSC buffer and an L-shaped spreader. Then, collect the liquid from the plate surface using a 1~mL pipette. For 25 cm×25 cm plates, typically use 8 mL of SSC buffer. Slightly more buffer can be used in this step.# C2. Pili shearing and precipitation (generalized method for all other kinds of pili purification) Day 41.  Pass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili. Begin with the ^18G needle first and then pass through the 25G needle twice. Note: Thinner needles help shear the pili but may clog.2. Repeat the shearing process iteratively for all plates, processing 5–10 plates at a time, and vortex the liquid for 30~s .3.  After collecting all the plates, adjust the total volume of the solution to 1~L~ by adding pre-chilled SSC buffer. Incubate the liquid suspension at 4^°C for 2h and stir gently.4.  Centrifuge the cell solution at 8,000×g for 30min at 4^°C to remove any remaining cells. Centrifuge twice to make sure cells are removed, and then collect the supernatant using a pipette.5. As the pili are present in large volumes, precipitate the supernatant by adding 5% PEG6000 (diluted from 50% PEG) and 500mMNaCl . After 4h of incubation at 4^°C , collect the precipitate by centrifuging the suspension at 15,000×g for 40-50 min , twice.6. At this stage, resuspend the purified pili pellet in 2~mL of 50~mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, p H8.0 (F pilus).7.  Dialysis the 2mL pili samples using dialysis buffer overnight.# D. Pili purification and dialysis# Days 5 and 61. CsCl step gradient setup: The purification steps need CsCl step gradients of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3g/cm^3 ( 4mL , 3~mL , and 3~mL , respectively). If the band is formed high in the tube, consider adding 1.4~g/cm^3 for 0.5 mL and reducing 1.3~g/cm^3 to 2.5mL .2.  When loading the CsCl gradient, ensure the needle reaches the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Different density layers are loaded onto the tube one by one. Begin by loading the low-density gradient, followed by the middle-density gradient, and finally the highest-density gradient. The needle should always reach the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Gently depress the syringe plunger to allow the lighter gradients to rise smoothly. Finally, load around 1.5mL of the pili sample onto the top of the gradient solution (Figure 2A).()Figure 2. CsCl gradient preparation, sample loading, and sample collection. (A) CsCl gradient preparation. When loading the CsCl gradient, ensure the needle reaches the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Begin by loading the low-density gradient, followed by the middle-density gradient, and finally the highest-density gradient. The needle should always reach the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Gently depress the syringe plunger to allow the lighter gradients to rise smoothly. The pili sample is loaded onto the top of the gradient solution in the final step. (B) When extracting the bands, remove the bottom band first to avoid disturbing the gradients above it.3.  Centrifuge the sample at ^19,200× g for 19h at 4^°C using SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor. Ensure proper tube balance before starting centrifugation. Note: For A. gp16, there will be two bands formed within the tube—the top band represents curved, thin pili, while the bottom band is composed of straight, thicker pili, which is the type IV pili. This is verified by the ssRNA phage as an antibody as well as mass spec. For F-pili, only one band forms in the tube, as strain MC4100 cells produce only one type of pili.4.  Use a syringe with a 23 G needle to extract the pili band from the tube. Note: We prefer the 23 G needle because it is thin enough to precisely extract a single band while being sufficiently rigid to puncture the side of the centrifuge tube (Figure 2B).5.  Carefully remove the pili band and extensively dialyze it against the dialysis buffer using a dialysis cassette.6. Perform initial dialysis for 4h in 1~L~ of buffer, followed by overnight dialysis in 2L of fresh buffer, and finally another 4h of dialysis in 2L of buffer.7. Confirm the presence of pili using SDS-PAGE and verify their identity using LC-ESI MS/MS. Two types of pili are present in A. gp16. The presence and purity of type IV pili are confirmed by negative-stain electron microscopy. Note: We used 4%-20% acrylamide gradient gels.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Host Bacteria Culture\n## Day 1 Afternoon\nRecover A. gp16 from -80°C storage and place on ice.\nObtain a small amount of bacteria from the thawed stock using a sterile inoculation loop.\nStreak the loop across the surface of an LB agar plate using the quadrant streak method.\nIncubate the plate at 30°C overnight to allow colony formation.\n## Day 2 Afternoon\nPrepare 100 LB agar plates without antibiotics.\nPick a single colony and inoculate it into 3mL of LB medium for overnight shaking at 30°C.\n## Day 3\nInoculate 100µL from the 3mL overnight culture into 30mL of LB medium.\nIncubate the A. gp16 cell culture with shaking at 200rpm at 30°C until the culture reaches OD600 = 0.1.\nAdd 100µL of culture to each of the 100 prepared agar plates and spread evenly using a cell spreader.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 30min to allow the surface to dry slightly.\nInvert the plates for overnight incubation to prevent accumulated humidity from dripping onto the surface.\n## Host Bacteria Collection\n## Day 4\nPre-chill the dialysis buffer at 4°C.\nTake out the overnight plates from 30°C and immediately place them on ice.\nCollect the bacterial cells from the plates using 300µL of dialysis buffer with an L-shaped spreader.\n## Pili Shearing and Precipitation\n## Day 4\nPass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili.\nRepeat the shearing process iteratively for all plates, processing 5-10 plates at a time, and vortex the liquid for 30s.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 3,470×g for 30min at 4°C to remove the cells.\n## Alternative Method for Pili Purification\nPre-chill the SSC buffer at 4°C.\nCollect the bacterial cells from the plates using 500µL of SSC buffer and an L-shaped spreader.\nPass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili.\nAdjust the total volume of the solution to 1L by adding pre-chilled SSC buffer and incubate at 4°C for 2h.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 8,000×g for 30min at 4°C to remove any remaining cells.\nPrecipitate the supernatant by adding 5% PEG6000 and 500mM NaCl.\n## Pili Purification and Dialysis\n## Days 5 and 6\nSet up CsCl step gradients of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3g/cm³.\nLoad the CsCl gradient into the centrifuge tube, ensuring the needle reaches the bottom.\nCentrifuge the sample at 19,200×g for 19h at 4°C using an SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor.\nExtract the pili band from the tube using a syringe with a 23G needle.\nDialyze the pili band against the dialysis buffer using a dialysis cassette.\nConfirm the presence of pili using SDS-PAGE and verify their identity using LC-ESI MS/MS.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Structural Biology Techniques"}}

Obtain the eyeballs from a slaughterhouse (pig) or extract eyeballs by sacrificing the rabbit in an animal lab facility, usually by injecting the lethal dose of 60~mg/mL pentobarbital (Mebunat; Orion Pharma, Finland) into the marginal ear veins. The eyeball can be removed via enucleation, which is a surgical process to remove and detach the eye from the orbit. The outer part of the eyelid is usually cut with the help of sharp scissors. All tissue connections should be separated between the eyeball and the surrounding orbit with the help of sharp scissors. Detach the eyeball and place it on ice in prelabeled plastic bags, named with left/right eye, animal numbers, and further experimental details.2.  Keep the eyeballs immersed in ice-cold 1× DPBS, pH 7.4, on ice after extraction and during transportation.3. Set up the required equipment for dissection, including sharp straight and curved scissors, beakers, Petri dishes, scalpel, filter papers, brushes to scrape RPE, and sterile Eppendorf tubes. In addition, buffer (approximately 5-6~mL of PBS/eye), sterile water, and ethanol for washing purposes should be placed in Falcon tubes (Figure 1).4.  Label the collection tubes ( 1.5-2~mL Eppendorf tubes), weigh each empty tube (conjunctiva, lens, irisciliary body, cornea, aqueous humor, vitreous, neural retina, RPE, choroid, sclera), and keep them on ice.5.  Note the weights of the empty tubes and record them on the provided sheet. This data will be used later to calculate the weight of the tissues. To obtain the tissue weight, subtract the weight of the tube with tissues from the weight of the empty tube (Table 1).()Figure 1. Equipment and reagents for ocular tissue dissectionTable 1. Sheet to record the weight of isolated ocular tissues()6.  Start the dissection by removing the eye from the buffer and placing it on filter paper in the Petri dish or on a cooled pad (for thermosensitive samples, to preserve the protein/sample integrity) on filter paper. 7.  First, remove all extraocular parts, as shown in Figures 2 and 3 (A and B).Cite as: Hammid, A. (2024). A Standardized Protocol for Extraction and Homogenization of Ocular Tissues. Bio-protocol 14(10): e4988. DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4988.()Figure 2. Removing extraocular muscles and parts during ocular tissue extraction. A. Holding the eyeball with the help of tweezers. B. Cutting extra ocular parts with the help of scissors.()Figure 3. Clean eyeball after removing all extraocular muscles and parts. A. Side of the eyeball. B.Front of the eyeball.8.  Aspirate the aqueous humor through the limbus using a 1mL syringe and ^26G needle (Figure 4A) before cutting the eyeball, as it will collapse during the extraction of intraocular tissues. Hold the syringe in one hand and, with the other hand, hold the eyeball to keep it in a stable and fixed position. Insert the syringe near the peripheral cornea from the limbus into the anterior chamber, which is the space between the cornea (the clear surface) and the iris (the colored part). Avoid inserting directly into the center to avoid damage to the lens (Figure 4). The amount of aqueous humor collected can vary depending on species and handling, ranging between 20 and 200~uL .()Figure 4. Aqueous humor aspiration. A. Aspiration aided by a syringe and needle. B. Graphical representation of the aspiration of aqueous humor.9.  After aqueous humor collection, the conjunctiva can be collected from the outer interior part with the help of a scalpel or scissors (Figure 5A–C). Place the eyeball on the Petri dish and pull up the conjunctival layer 3-5 mm away from the limbus with the help of a small tweezer; make a hole in the layer between the conjunctiva and the connective tissues beneath. Start cutting and moving forward to get a layer of conjunctiva while avoiding the adjacent muscles. Cut and collect pieces of bulbar conjunctiva in a tube and place the tube on ice after collection.()Figure 5. Steps for collecting the bulbar conjunctiva. A. Placing the eyeball on the Petri dish, holding the conjunctival layer. B. Cutting with the help of tweezers and scissors. C. Collection of the bulbar conjunctival layer.10. Next, grab the eyeball tightly by holding it with the help of filter paper and mark a cut on the limbus (2 mm from the edge of the cornea). Carefully cut the eye with the help of curved scissors around the iris (Figure 6). The eyecup is now cut into two parts: the anterior and the posterior eye cup. The anterior eye cup contains tissues such as the lens, iris-ciliary body, and cornea, while the posterior contains vitreous, retina, retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, and sclera.()Figure 6. Cutting the eye with the help of scissors to open the eye cup11. Open the eye cup and collect all the anterior eye tissues lens, iris-ciliary body, and cornea (Figure 7) into labeled tubes on ice. The lens is a crystalline, transparent, gelatinous, and round structure (Figure 7A). The iris and ciliary body are ring-shaped and dark-colored structures next to the lens (Figure 7B), while the cornea is a transparent top layer of the eye cup (Figure 7C). From the anterior eye cup, the lens can be easily pulled out with the help of forceps; then, the iris-ciliary body can be detached by holding it with the help of tweezers while peeling and separating gently away from the back of the cornea. In the end, the cornea is visible, isolated from the rest of the anterior ocular tissues.()Figure 7. Anterior eye tissues. A. Lens B. Iris-ciliary body. C. Cornea.12. From the posterior eye cup, collect the vitreous and neural retina first and then the retinal pigment epithelium cells; finally, separate the choroid from the sclera. The vitreous can be aspirated via pipetting and carefully separating from the neural retina. Collection will be smoother when using a broader pipette tip (e.g., 1~mL or bigger) compared with a narrow and small tip because of the gel-like structure of the vitreous, as shown in Figure 8. Collect only the clear and transparent vitreous to avoid contamination by retinal tissues.()# Figure 8. Neural retina and vitreous visible on top of the posterior eye cup13. After removing the vitreous, the neural retina can be pulled out gently and detached easily from the RPE layer (shown in Figure 8) with the help of forceps or broad-tip tweezers. The isolation of the neural retina from RPE is easier when using a fresh eye.14. Now, the eye cup has RPE on the top. The dark-colored pigmented RPE can be easily visually distinguished from the retina (Figure 9). To place the posterior eye cup in a multi-well plate, use sterile forceps or tweezers to grip its edges. Carefully lower the eye cup into the selected well and ensure it is placed in any required well. Adjust the position by moving it to locate it exactly in the middle (Figure 9B). Pipette 1 mL of 1×PBS on the eye cup while placing it in a multi-well plate. Wait at least 5~min to help RPE cells detach and immerse in the buffer. After 5~min , scrape the RPE layer with the help of a small brush to recover the RPE cells. Repeat twice until all RPE is collected (as shown in Figure 9A–E).15. Centrifuge the RPE suspensions at 6,000× g for 5min at 4:^°C to pellet the RPE. The supernatant can be discarded; the pellet contains the desired RPE cells that are to be stored (Figure 9E).()Figure 9. Steps for collecting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from the eyecup. A. Take the posterior eye cup. B. Pipette 1× PBS to the eye cup (e.g., 1 mL, 2× ) while placing it in a multi-well plate and wait for 5:min to let RPE cells detach. C. Scrape with the help of a small brush to detach RPE cells. D. Remove the eye cup and take the buffer containing RPE cells with the help of a pipette in the Eppendorf tube. E. Centrifuge the RPE suspensions at 6000× g for 5~min at 4^°C to pellet the RPE. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellet containing RPE cells.16. The choroid is a sticky tissue that can be scraped with a scalpel to separate it from the sclera. The pigmented choroid will be visually distinguishable from the sclera. Peel off the choroid, starting from one edge from the top of the sclera to separate both layers. The detailed steps are shown in Figure 10.()Figure 10. Steps showing the peeling off of the choroid from the top of the sclera18. Wash the sclera with PBS to eliminate traces of choroid. Take a clean beaker and fill it with 1×PBS . Make sure there is enough PBS to completely immerse the sclera and repeat this three times to ensure complete removal of choroid traces.19. Weigh the individual tubes containing tissues and subtract the empty tube weight to get the actual tissue weight. Keep a record of tissue weights while placing tissues on ice during and after weighing.# B. Homogenization using Bead Ruptor Elite homogenizer1.  Homogenization of ocular tissues can be done using a Bead Ruptor Elite homogenizer and 2.8mm diameter ceramic beads.2.  Label 2~mL hard tissue homogenizing reinforced tubes prefilled with four beads per tube ( 2.8mm diameter).3.  Precool the Cryo cooling unit of the homogenizer using liquid nitrogen or dry ice with ethanol according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain a constant temperature at 4~^°C before loading the heatsensitive samples.4.  Add tissue pieces (cut the tough tissues into smaller pieces using a scalpel to aid in homogenization) to the tubes and 1× DPBS buffer (3:1, volume/tissue weight or depending on working dilution required).5.  Unlock the finger plate on top of the tube carriage and remove it by rotating it. Load the 2~mL sample tubes on a precooled (4 ^°C) 24-bead raptor tube carriage. Samples must be spaced evenly (it is recommended to load at least four tubes simultaneously with approximately equal weight; for that, weigh the tubes beforehand). Lock the carriage before the run.6.  For hard tissues such as the cornea and conjunctiva, use a 1-min cycle 4× at a speed of 6m/s as described earlier 11. The cycle speed (m/s) , run time (s), and dwell time between runs can be adjusted according to the tissue. The vitreous and aqueous humor can be homogenized without adding buffer (or depending upon the dilution required) at a low cycle speed and using less run time, e.g., a 1-min cycle one time at a speed of 6m/s ). Note: Both aqueous humor and vitreous are homogenized to ensure uniformity during protein quantification, enhance the accuracy of analyses, and achieve consistency in results and subsequent analysis.7.  Here, the starting temperature of each cycle is very critical for temperature-sensitive samples. If the start temperature of the cycle is at -2~^°C , for a 1-min cycle it will not exceed the limit of 4^°C Before the next cycle, turn on the cooling chamber and bring the temperature of the sample chamber down to -2~^°C .8. In addition, the sample loading carriage can be placed in a fridge at 4^°C to keep it cold.9.  Once the sample carriage chamber is cool, load the samples and press Run to start the cycle and Stop to stop the run on the screen.10.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-146","title":"Updated Pseudo-seq Protocol for Transcriptome-Wide Detection of Pseudouridines","text":"Updated Pseudo-seq Protocol for Transcriptome-Wide Detection of Pseudouridines\n\n# Abstract\n\nPseudouridine () , the most prevalent modified base in cellular RNAs, has been mapped to numerous sites not only in rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs but also mRNAs. Although there have been multiple techniques to identify s , due to the recent development of sequencing technologies some reagents are not compatible with the current sequencer. Here, we show the updated Pseudo-seq, a technique enabling the genome-wide identification of pseudouridylation sites with single-nucleotide precision. We provide a comprehensive description of Pseudo-seq, covering protocols for RNA isolation from human cells, library preparation, and detailed data analysis procedures. The methodology presented is easily adaptable to any cell or tissue type with high-quality mRNA isolation. It can be used for discovering novel pseudouridylation sites, thus constituting a crucial initial step toward understanding the regulation and function of this modification.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nCells, reagents, and enzymes\n\n1.

Although this protocol follows the workflow of the original Pseudo-seq method 19, the data generated using this protocol is different and we will show the data analysis method in detail.Store all materials at 4^°C except for SDS-containing buffers and perform the procedure on ice. Room temperature is defined as 22~^°C throughout this protocol. All washing steps throughout the protocol are performed with a volume of 1~mL unless stated differently.# A. Cell culture, transfection, and RNA collection1.  HEK293 cells were cultivated in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. Cells grown for under 20 passages are desired, but older cells can be used as long as they are of normal morphology.2.  Cell passage: a.  Wash the cells with 37 ^°C PBS once. b.  Add trypsin to the dishes and incubate at 37 ^°C for 3 min . c.  Add the FBS-containing medium to the dishes to inactivate trypsin. d.

Place the tube into the magnetic rack, pull the beads to the side of the tube, and remove and discard supernatant.36. Wash the beads with dT-wash buffer 1 one more time, dT-wash buffer 2 (see Recipes) once, and low-salt buffer (see Recipes) once in the same way.37. Place the tube into the magnetic rack, pull the beads to the side of the tube, and remove and discard supernatant.38. Add 200~uL of dT-elution buffer (see Recipes) and vortex gently to suspend beads.39. Incubate at 50 ^°C for 2 min with occasional agitation to elute poly (A)^+ RNA.40.

Note: At this point, the protocol can be paused overnight, and the sample can be stored at -20~^°C .42. To remove the contaminated beads, perform phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation in the same way as in steps A21–A27, except for adding 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc ( 40~uL per tube here) instead of adding G50 buffer (Note 2).# B.

Dilute the RNA into 1× shatter buffer on ice: 5~uL of 5×RNA shatter buffer (see Recipes) 20~uL of RNA in ddH_2O3.  Place the RNA sample into the thermal cycler. Heat for 120~s .4.  After heating, immediately and quickly slam the tube on ice and add 25~uL of ice-cold stop/PNK buffer (see Recipes) to stop (Note 3).5.  Add 2.5~uL of T4 PNK.6.  Incubate at 37~^°C with lid at 40~^°C for 30 min in the thermal cycler to resolve and remove 2^-3^ cyclic phosphates.7.  After 30min , add the premixed mixture below: 5~uL of 10× FastAP buffer 5~uL of FastAP enzyme 37.5~uL of ddH_2O8.  Incubate at 37 ^°C with lid at 40^°C for 15min in the thermal cycler.9.

Wash beads: Place tube on the magnet and allow beads to separate; remove supernatant carefully. Resuspend beads in 1~mL of 75% ethanol and transfer to a new tube. Place tube on the magnet and allow beads to separate; remove supernatant carefully. Wash twice more with 75% ethanol, allowing beads to sit for 30~s each time. Place tube on the magnet and allow beads to separate; remove supernatant carefully, getting all residual liquid possible. Allow beads to air-dry for 5min . d. Elute RNA: Resuspend beads in 30~uL of ddH_2O and incubate for 5min at room temperature. Place tube on the magnet and allow beads to separate. Transfer 18~uL of the supernatant to a new tube (for +CMC) and 12 uL to a second tube (for -CMC). Note: The difference in volume between C M C+/- is to account for the reduction in precipitation efficiency of the CMC-modified RNA.# C. CMC treatment1.  Preheat the thermal cycler up to 80^°C with the hot lid.2.  Add 2.9uL of 40mM EDTA to both samples, heat for 3min at 80^°C to denature, and then place them on ice.3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-188","title":"Analysis of DNA 5-methylcytosine Using Nanopore Sequencing","text":"Analysis of DNA 5-methylcytosine Using Nanopore Sequencing\n\n# Abstract\n\nDNA methylation is known to be a conserved repressive epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms, which involves the transfer of a methyl group to the C5 position of cytosine by DNA methyltransferase. In plants, DNA methylation occurs in CG and non-CG (including CHG and CHH, H=A , T, C) sequence contexts. It is widespread in the genome and involved in various biological processes to regulate gene expression and genome stability. Nowadays, Nanopore sequencing enables the direct detection of DNA modification on native single-molecule long-read DNA, overcoming the limitation of short-read bisulfite sequencing. To facilitate the Nanopore-based DNA methylation analysis in plants, in this protocol, we provide the guidance of the software DeepSignal-plant, which can accurately call 5mC in all three contexts of CG, CHG, and CHH with high correlation with bisulfite sequencing in plants.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\n# Case studyWe will use a small sample data of Arabidopsis Nanopore sequencing for the case study. Figure 1 shows the overview of the workflow for genomic methylation analysis with Nanopore data.()Figure 1. DeepSignal-plant pipeline. This pipeline consists of nine steps. Steps 1 and 2 help us to get the nucleotide sequence in fastq format from FAST5 output files for Nanopore sequencers. Step 3 uses tombo to match the called sequences back to the electric current signal stored in FAST5 file, and Step 4 aligns the current signal to the reference genome. Then, in Steps 5 and 6, we use DeepSignal-plant to call the 5-methylcytosine and also calculate the frequency. Finally, in Steps 8 and 9, we calculate the bin methylation level and visualize the data with tools like IGV browser or python plot.# A. Preparation1.  Pipeline download The pipeline we used in this protocol can be downloaded on the GitHub page (https://github.com/Bioprotocol/DeepSignalplantPractise) with the command:Cite as: Li, Z. et al. (2024).

The examples for intermediate and the final output are stored in “cache” and “output” folders, respectively. The “lib” folder contains python scripts used within the workflow. Users can prepare the input data in the “input” folder as the following guidance.# 2.  Data preparationa. Nanopore dataThe Nanopore sequence sample data “sample_data.tar.gz” we used here was modified from the sample data provided by DeepSignal-plant 13. Users can download it from Google Drive with browser  Edge  or  Chrome  (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NZe6mQ5y1S8eaEGwU124PvmONBoz5X7?usp=sharing)  to  a  local  computer  and  transfer  it  to  the  folder “DeepSignalplantPractise/input/Step1_Input.” The command below is used to decompress the file:tar -zxvf sample_data.tar.gz mv sample_data DeepSignalplantPractise/input/Step1_InputIn the “sample_data” folder, users will find four files ending in .fast5. These example files are in FAST5 format and were generated from Nanopore sequencing, containing the raw electric signal that we can  call  the  base  sequence  and  modification.  Users  can  refer  to https://hasindu2008.github.io/slow5specs/fast5_demystified.pdf for a detailed introduction of the FAST5 forma 14.b.  Reference genome and annotation Here, we used TAIR10 as the reference genome for Arabidopsis.

Environment preparation and software installationa. MambaMamba is recommended for the environment management of the tools we use. Conda should be installed before mamba. Users can find the right version for their system on the Conda product page (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). It can be installed with the commands below use the 64-Bit (x86) Installer as the example:# #install condawget -c https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linuxx86_64.shbash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh# #install mambaconda install -c conda-forge mambab. DeepSignal-plantUsers can set up the environment for DeepSignal-plant and install all its dependencies with Mamba. In this protocol, we use PATHofDeepSignalPlant to indicate the path for DeepSignal-plant download and MambaEnv to indicate the path of the Mamba environment. Users will need to replace these two variables manually with the path they use. For further information, users can find guidance on the DeepSignal-plant GitHub page (https://github.com/PengNi/deepsignal-plant).#create an environment Mamba create -n deepsignalpenv python ^=3 .7 #activate environment mamba activate deepsignalpenv# #download DeepSignal-plantcd PATHofDeepSignalPlant git clone https://github.com/PengNi/deepsignal-plant.git# #installpip install deepsignal-plant#re-install pytorch if neededmamba install pytorch ==1 .11.0 cudatoolkit = 10.2 -c pytorch#install tombomamba install -c bioconda ont-tomboAfter these steps, the DeepSignal-plant is installed in the Mamba environment to the path mathbbS MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv/. When using the tools in this environment, users should make sure it has been activated or set in the environment variable with “export PATH.”c. GuppyGuppy is used for Nanopore sequence basecalling. Users can download from the software download page in the Nanopore community (https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads, Figure 2). User registration is required. Users can find the version that matches their system and install it following the guidance it provides:()Figure 2. Guppy download paged. IGV The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a widely used tool to visualize genomic data. Users can find the version suitable for their system and download  it  at https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download. ont_fast5_api package The  ont_fast5_api_package  is  a  tool  for  the  FAST5  file  operation.  We  will  use  the “multi_to_single_fast5” tool in this package in Section B, step 1. This package can be downloaded with the command:# #ont_fast5_api_package installcd ./DeepSignalplantPractise/libgit clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/ont_fast5_api.gitpip install ./ont_fast5_api# B.  PracticeWe provide the protocol from raw data preparation to visualization for Nanopore methylation analysis by Nanopore sequencing with nine steps in total. Users can find the commands and run them in the “DeepSignalplantPractise/workflow” folder.# Step 1. Convert the multi-read FAST5 into single-read form.The FAST5 files generated by Nanopore sequencing are usually in multi-read FAST5 format, as are the sample data we provided, as shown in Figure 3 (1,000 reads per file in our samples). Users can use the h5ls tool provided by Conda to inspect the FAST5 files.# #preview all reads in FAST5 filecd ./DeepSignalplantPractise/workflow h5ls -r ../input/Step1_Input/sample_data/batch_0.fast5()Figure 3. Structure of the multi-read FAST5 file (previewed by h5ls, only the first four reads were shown)Because Tombo only accepts single-read FAST5 format (one read per file), we use the “multi_to_single_fast5” tool from the ont_fast5_api package to convert multi-read FAST5 files into single-read form before using Guppy and Tombo. The command is shown below:# #01.multi_to_single_fast5.shmkdir ../cache/SINGLE_sample_datamulti_to_single_fast5 -i ../input/Step1_Input/sample_data -s ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data -t 30 --recursiveAfter conversion, you will find folders named with numbers containing multiple single-read FAST5 files in the output “../cache/SINGLE_sample_data” folder. The structure of single-read FAST5 is shown in Figure 4.h5ls -r ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data/0/ffee8b3e-95ba-44e6-951c-5e7982d3b5f 0.fast5()# Figure 4. Structure of the single-read FAST5 file (previewed by h5ls)# Step 2. Basecall FAST5 files with Guppy.This step is to basecall the single-read FAST5 file with Guppy. The task may require a huge amount of calculating resources and is recommended to be run with GPU for faster processing. Users can find details for Guppy usage in  the  Guppy  protocol  available  in  the Nanopore community (https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/Guppyprotocol/v/gpb_2003_v1_revae_14dec2018) (registration needed). If users cannot access Guppy, they can download the basecalled  fastq files we prepared from Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pk4vecjdC48gslbeXGNKforUb0jxRPpz?usp=sharing) and decompress it under the “cache” folder for the downstream analysis. The basic use of the parameters is listed as follows:()The commands used for basecalling are listed below:# #02.basecall.shguppy_basecaller-i ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data-s ../cache/fastq-c dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac_prom.cfg--recursive--disable_pings--qscore_filtering--device \"cuda:all:100%\"The basecalling model set by “-c” can be selected based on the flowcell and kit for sequencing. Users can use the command below to see the corresponding model (Figure 5):()# Figure 5. Corresponding basecalling model for flowcell and kit (part)This step produces two folders, “fail” and “pass,” and two files named “sequencing_summary.txt” and “sequencing_telemetry.js.” The fastq files in the “pass” folder containing the base sequence information and the file “sequencing_summary.txt” containing the basecalling information for each read are used for Tombo preprocess in the next step.# Step 3. Add the basecalled sequence back to FAST5 with Tombo preprocess.Tombo provides useful tools for raw Nanopore signal processing and can be used for modification identification as well 15. In this step, we use Tombo to allocate the basecalled fastq sequence back to the raw signal. Here are the commands.# #03 .tombo_preprocess.sh#environment setting, replace MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv with your actual pathexport PATH .=. MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv/bin:PATH# Tombo preprocess# “*fastq” represents all the files with names end with “fastq” in the “pass” directory.cat ../cache/fastq/pass/*fastq > ../cache/fastq/pass.fastqtombo preprocess annotate_raw_with_fastqs--fast5-basedir ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data--fastq-filenames ../cache/fastq/pass.fastq--sequencing-summary-filenames ../cache/fastq/sequencing_summary.txt--overwrite--processes 30After this operation, the basecalled information is added back to the corresponding FAST5 file under the “Basecall_1D_000” group in the “Analyses” section (Figure 6). When users need to rerun this step, they can use the parameter “--overwrite” to overwrite the previously written information and files. If the command is rerun without the parameter “--overwrite,” there will be multiple groups of basecalled folder added under the “Analyses” group, named “Basecall_1D_001,” “Basecall_1D_002,” and so on.h5ls -r ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data/0/ffee8b3e-95ba-44e6-951c5e7982d3b5f0.fast5()Figure 6. File structure of fast5 after preprocess (previewed by h5ls). The red box highlights the new generated files at step 3.# Step 4. Map the raw signal to reference genome with Tombo resquiggle.This step aims to map the raw electric signal to the reference genome. Here are the commands:#04 .tombo_resquiggle.sh#environment setting, replace MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv with your actual pathexport PATH = MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv/bin:PATH # resquigglertombo resquiggle../cache/SINGLE_sample_data../input/reference/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa--processes 30--corrected-group RawGenomeCorrected_000--basecall-group Basecall_1D_000--overwrite--ignore-read-locksThe parameter “--basecall-group” uses the group name “Basecall_1D_000” generated in the previous step in the FAST5 file (Figure 6) to define which basecalled sequence is to be used. After this step, the sequences with the  signal  assignment  are  written  back  into  the  FAST5  file,  generating  a  group  named “RawGenomeCorrected .000^° (set by “--corrected-group,” Figure 7).h5ls -r ../cache/SINGLE_sample_data/0/ffee8b3e-95ba-44e6-951c5e7982d3b5f0.fast5()Figure 7. Structure of the FAST5 file after resquiggle (previewed by h5ls). The red box highlights the new generated files at step 4.With the shell command “ll -a,” users can find a hidden index file (“.SINGLE_sample_data.RawGenomeCorrected_000.tombo.index”) accompanying “SINGLE_sample_data” folder (Figure 8). The index file is generated for faster later steps. In addition, users can use “--overwrite” to overwrite files when  rerunning  this  step. Details  for  resquiggle can be found in https://nanoporetech.github.io/tombo/resquiggle.html?highlight=corrected%20group.This step uses the “call_mods” command in DeepSignal-plant to call the modification from input resquiggled FAST5 files. All three contexts of 5mC can be called. To accelerate this step, GPU is recommended. The parameter “CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES” is used to set the mode for GPU use (CPU only: =0 ; use one: =0 ; use two: =0,1 and so on). The model file ending in .ckpt is required for 5mC calling, and users can download it from the GitHub page of DeepSignal-plant (https://github.com/PengNi/DeepSignal-plant).

When the unmethylated probability (column 7) is higher than the methylated probability (column 8), the site is considered as unmethylated and labeled as “0” in column 9, and vice versa.()# Figure 9. Output of DeepSignal-plant call_mods# Step 6. Calculate methylation frequency with DeepSignal-plant call_freq.This step calculates the methylation frequency of each C in the reference genome based on the file “fast5s.C.call_mods.tsv” generated in the previous step and outputs a modification frequency file for all three contexts together. For each site, the ratio of the read counts with methylated cytosine to total read counts is defined as methylation frequency or site methylation level 16. GPU is not required for this step. We use the parameter “--bed” to set the output format as bedMethyl, which can be dealt with bed format–related tools (Figure 10). The parameter “--sort” is used to sort the results according to the genomic location for further processing.# #06.deepplant-met-freq.sh#environment setting, replace MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv with your actual pathexport PATH =varsigma MambaEnv/deepsignalpenv/bin:PATH #calculate frequency#deepsignal_plant call_freq--input_path ../cache/fast5s.C.call_mods.tsv--result_file ../cache/fast5s.C.call_mods.freq.bed--sort --bed()Figure 10. Output of DeepSignal-plant call_freq# Step 7. Split the result into CG, CHG, and CHH context.This step uses the script “split_freq_file_by_5mC_motif.py” provided by DeepSignal-plant to split the methylation frequency according to the three different contexts CG, CHG, and CHH. The python script was downloaded and stored in the “scripts” folder when we installed the DeepSignal-plant (see 2.2 DeepSignalplant). Users can also find it on the GitHub page of DeepSignal-plant (https://github.com/PengNi/deepsignalplant/tree/master/scripts). The input file is fast5s.C.call_mods.freq.bed generated in the previous step. The reference genome file is also required. The output is methylation frequency files for three individual contexts (Figure 11). Here are the commands:# #07.split_context.sh# #replace PATHofDeepSignalPlant with your actual pathpython PATHofDeepSignalPlant/scripts/split_freq_file_by_5mC_motif.py  --freqfile ../cache/fast5s.C.call_mods.freq.bed  --ref ../input/reference/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa()Figure 11. Three methylation frequency files generated for CG, CHG, and CHH in bedMethyl format# Step 8. Calculate the weighed methylation level in the bin.Up to now, we have gained the single-site DNA methylation level for all three contexts. However, for downstream analysis and visualization, we usually have to calculate the methylation level in bins rather than in sites. To calculate the weighed methylation of each bin 16, we define the sites with more than three read counts (coverage >3 ) as the valid site, and bins with more than three valid cytosine sites as the valid bin. The methylation level for the invalid bin was recorded as NaN 17. In valid bins, the weighed methylation level is calculated as follows:sum_i=1^nM_i Bigg/sum_i=1^n(C i)In this formula, M represents the methylated read counts of the valid site i, and C represents its coverage. The python script “met_level_bin.py” for the methylation level calculation we provided here is also used in our previously published Pore-C data 18.We used the small sample data in the previous steps for time-saving practices. However, its coverage is insufficient for bin-weighed methylation level calculation and visualization. For this reason, we use the methylation frequency files generated from the Pore-C data (Project: PRJCA006702, Run Accession CRR327363, Pore-C Rep2 for Col-0) 18 in the following analysis, with binsize =100 bp for IGV, and binsize =100,000 bp for python plotting. Users can find the preprocessed data of Pore-C in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14xw6gvQz_gjUi6p86NrSHZq59YABlzZO?usp=sharing.Users can run the python script (met_level_bin.py) in the DeepSignalplantPractise folder downloaded from our GitHub page (refer to Section 3. Download scripts) and get the bin weighed methylation level (binsize = 100,000 bp) as follows:# #08 .met_level_bin.shpython ../lib/met_level_bin.py--region_bed ../input/reference/Tair10_genome.bed--met_bed ../input/Step8_Input/Rep2_fast5s.C.call_mods.CG.frequency.bed--prefix Rep2_fast5s.C.call_mods.CG--binsize 100000--outdir ../outputThe parameter “--region_bed” uses a bed file to define the genome coordinates for calculation. Here, we use the file “reference/Tair10_genome.bed” generated in data preparation (refer to Section 1.2 Reference genome preparation), which contains all chromosome coordinates of the Arabidopsis to set the input region. The parameter “--met_bed” uses each context’s methylation frequency file as the input. The parameter “--prefix” is to  set  the  prefix  of  the  output  file.  This  step  outputs  a  “bedGraph”  file  with  the  prefix “Rep2_fast5s.C.call_mods.CG.”# Step 9. Visualize the methylation level by IGV and python plotting.The “bedGraph” files created in the previous step contain four columns: chromosome name, start, end, and the bin weighed methylation level (Figure 12). Users can find a detailed explanation of the format “bedGraph” on the help page in UCSC Genome Browser https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bedgraph.html). This format file can be explored by genome browsers as IGV with different zoom levels (Figure 13). Users can find more information on IGV usage at https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/UserGuide.()Figure 12. Bedgraph format()Figure 13.

Methylation distribution in chromosome 4 plotted by python# DiscussionDeepSignal-plant has been applied to methylation detection in Arabidopsis, rice, and black mustard with high accuracy and sensitivity 13. Compared with other existing analysis tools for Nanopore data in plants, DeepSignalplant can achieve 5mC in all three contexts of CG, CHG, and CHH and shows high correlations with bisulfite sequencing 17. Furthermore, DeepSignal-plant can profile the methylation of more cytosines, especially in the repetitive regions. It also provides the tools for new model training when applied to the genomes of other plants 13.There are some points that users should pay attention to. First, although DeepSignal-plant works well with models trained across species, the CHH model in Arabidopsis shows relatively poor performance, which might be due to the low CHH methylation level in Arabidopsis. It is suggested that users should use a dataset containing enough valid sites for model training. Second, DeepSignal-plant is based on deep learning, indicating a high requirement for computational resources. There are two steps in which we recommend using GPU with the Arabidopsis data. When applied to large plant genomes, the memory and processing time required will increase drastically. If non-CG methylation analysis is not required, methods that use fewer resources like Nanopolis 10 may be a better choice. What′s more, sequence depth does not significantly impact the performance of the DeepSignal-plant. It can obtain acceptable results (Pearson correlation with bisulfite sequencing: >0.95 in CG context, >0.90 in CHG context, >0.8 in CHH context in Arabidopsis and rice) at low coverages (20×) , and the increase of coverage does not significantly improve the output. This feature serves as a cost-saving option for experimental design.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation\n## Pipeline Download\nDownload the pipeline from the GitHub page using the command: git clone

However, there are challenges associated with traditional biomaterials’ development due to the lack of underlying theory governing cell response to materials’ chemistry. This leads to the time-consuming process of testing different materials plus the adverse reactions in the body such as cytotoxicity and foreign body response. High-throughput screening (HTS) offers a solution to these challenges by enabling rapid and simultaneous testing of a large number of materials to determine their bio-interactions and biocompatibility. Secreted proteins regulate many physiological functions and determine the success of implanted biomaterials through directing cell behaviour. However, the majority of biomaterials’ HTS platforms are suitable for microscopic analyses of cell behaviour and not for investigating non-adherent cells or measuring cell secretions. Here, we describe a multi-well platform adaptable to robotic printing of polymers and suitable for secretome profiling of both adherent and non-adherent cells. We detail the platform's development steps, encompassing the preparation of individual cell culture chambers, polymer printing, and the culture environment, as well as examples to demonstrate surface chemical characterisation and biological assessments of secreted mediators. Such platforms will no doubt facilitate the discovery of novel biomaterials and broaden their scope by adapting wider arrays of cell types and incorporating assessments of both secretome and cell-bound interactions.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Reagents\n\n1.

Dip coating of glass substrate with pHEMA was performed as previously described 20 with some modifications as detailed here.# Part I. Substrate preparation# A. O_2 plasma etching1.  Put conventional 25:mm×75:mm glass sides in plasma etcher chamber and subject them to O_2 plasma (P =300 mbar, 100 W) for 10min .2.  To confirm that the slides are activated by excited ions, measure water contact angle (WCA) before and after plasma treatment 21. An example is shown in Figure 1; the presence of organic contamination increases the water contact angle; therefore, its removal results in a reduction in the observed contact angle 22,23.# B.  Functionalisation process1.  Add molecular sieves (4AA) to toluene at 20% w/v for 24~h prior to the silanisation process to have anhydrous toluene. See Troubleshooting.2.  After the etching step, submerge glass slides immediately into 500mL of anhydrous toluene in a crystallisation dish.3.  Place the reaction vessel on a hot plate set to 50^°C (see Troubleshooting).4.  Put the reaction under an argon atmosphere, place the funnel over the reaction vessel, and connect the argon to the neck of the funnel.5.  Add 10mL of GPTMS into the anhydrous toluene solution.6.  Allow this reaction to proceed for 24~h to achieve completion. You can use a frame stand and clamp to secure the reaction and argon.7.  Cool the slides to room temperature and wash them three times in fresh acetone to remove any residue of unbound silane.8.  Dry the slides under vacuum angle<50mTorr for 24h .9.  Use WCA measurement after the functionalisation step to ensure that silanisation has taken place completely. The functionalised glass slide becomes hydrophobic with a higher contact angle of 54^°pm1.11 (Figure 1). Measuring the WCA on a substrate is a commonly used method to quantify the substrate wettability and its cleanliness.()Figure 1.

The O_2 plasma–activated glass slide shows increased hydrophilicity with very low contact angle of <10^° , while after silanisation the substrate becomes hydrophobic with a higher contact angle of 54^°pm1.11 .# C. pHEMA dip coating1.  Prepare 4% w/v ) pHEMA solution in ethanol (95%v/v in deionised distilled water). See Troubleshooting.2.  Set up the settings of the dip-coater to 9mm/s speed and a dip duration of 2 s with a retention speed of 1 s.3.  Clip the glass slides to the holder and adjust the holder position to a proper height vertically.4.  Pour pHEMA solution in a 100~mL beaker and immerse epoxy silanised glass slides in the 4% pHEMA solution.5. Repeat coating four times with enough time for drying in between the dips (see Troubleshooting). While waiting for the slides to dry, cover the beaker containing pHEMA to prevent evaporation.6.  Leave the pHEMA-coated slides at atmospheric conditions for three days prior to its use for arraying.7.  Use optical profilometry to evaluate the evenness of pHEMA coating of the glass substrates. Figure 2 illustrates the uniformity of step height results from pHEMA coating.()Figure 2. Evaluation of evenness of pHEMA coat. Optical profilometer images and height line scans (5×) of a pHEMA-coated glass slide. (A) 2D image of the pHEMA-coated glass slide. The arrow shows the measured distance; the dipping lines are apparent on the side of the glass substrate, as the glass is coated four times. (B) Graph representing the space highlighted on the 2D image (A) showing the evenness of the pHEMA coat, as the step height variation is minimal.# Troubleshooting1.  Plasma treatment has been proven to be a simple technique for modifying surface properties, ensuring removal of impurities and organic contaminants from the surface, which are fixed by weak electrostatic/van der Waal’s forces 24. Bombardment of plasma excited ions to the surface of the glass slide promotes hydroxylation (OH groups) and generates the Si–OH groups.2.  Excess amount of water is detrimental to the extent of silanisation; therefore, use of molecular sieves in proper proportions to the water content of the solvent is critical 22.3. Maintaining the reaction at 50 °C is crucial to lower the number of weakly bonded silane molecules by disrupting the hydrogen bonds in silane layer 25.4.  The silane provides a bind between the glass slide and the pHEMA coat, as the methoxy groups of GPTMS bind the -OH on the glass slide and the reactive epoxy group binds -CH in pHEMA 22,26.5. To speed up the dissolvability of pHEMA in the intended solvent, it is useful to use smaller amounts in larger containers and sonication. For example, add 2:g of pHEMA in 50mL of 95% ethanol/deionised distilled water, close the cap, and leave the tube in the sonicator for 24h . Ultrasonication is often used to promote an effectiveand fast dissolution of pHEMA powder in ethanol.6.  Wet pHEMA appears cloudy on the surface of the glass slide and it takes much longer to dry between coating repetitions.7.  Tight sealing containers for pHEMA solutions are very important, as evaporation causes concentration change. Therefore, it is best to prepare fresh pHEMA solution for each coating session.8.  Coating the glass substrate with pHEMA provides an anchorage for arraying a diverse acrylate and methacrylate polymer library 4,9. As pHEMA swells in the presence of atmospheric moisture, it provides the possibility to form an interpenetrating network between the deposited polymer spots and the pHEMA. This increases their stability in the pretreatment washing steps, sterilisation process, and cell culturing conditions.# Part II. Fabrication of polymer wells# A.

First, add the required amount of monomer in a scintillation glass vial and seal the cap using rubber stoppers.b. Add a layer of parafilm around the cap area to ensure that the vial is airtight.c Insert a short needle (21 G,40 mm) ) through the cap to enable the degassing process.d. Insert a longer needle (21 G, 120 mm to bubble argon through the monomer. Make sure that the needle attached to argon source is dipped in the monomer while the degassing needle is away from the monomer.3.  Prepare the polymerisation solution by mixing 50% ( hatV/V for liquids, w/v for solids) monomer in DMF and 1% DMPA in a glove box under argon condition with O_2 levels <2,000 ppm. See Troubleshooting.4.  Transfer 40~uL of each polymerisation solution to a source plate (e.g., 384-well polypropylene plate).5.  Position the source plate in its place on printing machine stage.# B. Polymer deposition and in situ UV curing1.  Set the printing conditions inside the chamber for O_2<2,000 ppm using argon and 30%-40% humidity. See Troubleshooting.2. Wash the pin with isopropanol and insert into the microarray print head.3. Close the printer chamber to keep the printing environment settings.4. Initiate the software (BioDot AxSysTM) for printer stage and head. Recalibrate the X, Y, and Z positioning. Refer to Table 1 for the instrumental factors including print head travel speed and contact times.5.  Pre-spot four times on a plasma-etched glass slide prior to deposition of the polymerisation solution on pHEMA-coated substrate. The blotting pattern can be two contacts per position to remove the excess polymerisation solution from the outside of the pin.6. Start the printing process. For example, for an area of 7 mm×7 mm of pHEMA-coated glass slide to be coated by acrylate polymers, print 56 spots with 850~um distance in the y-axis, with an alternating +850 um/850um offset in the X -axis. Figure 3A illustrates the brightfield images of the single printed polymer spots.7.  Polymerise deposited spots with 40~s of long wave UV ( 365~nm) intervals to liberate the radical ions in the DMPA, which creates the polymerisation of monomers. During this time, the pin is washed in DMF and dried three times before printing the next polymer.8.  After printing all the polymers, further add 20min of UV exposure at the completion point of each printing session.9.  Keep the printed glass slides in <50 mTorr vacuum for 24h prior to the second print in between spots.10. To print in between polymer spots for full coverage, increase the initiation position by 800um . Figure 3B shows the double-printed spots coverage.Table 1. Instrumental settings for movements of the stage and pin holder()()Figure 3. Comparison of brightfield (5×) images of printing pattern. A. Single-printed polymer spots. B. Double-printed polymer surface. The visual examination demonstrates a significantly enhanced substrate coverage after the second printing.# 11. Repeat step B6.12. Lastly, keep the printed slides in <50 mTorr vacuum for at least seven days to ensure extraction of the residual solvent and unpolymerised monomers.# Troubleshooting1.  Be vigilant about potential issues arising from phase separation before printing, possibly linked to solvent compatibility.2.  Minimise contamination in polymerisation solutions by using solvent-compatible pipetting tools. For example, avoid using polystyrene pipetting tips while using DMF as a solvent.3.  There are many aspects to consider in contact printing to ensure consistency of the polymer areas; some of these are addressed through optimisation of the chamber environment such as humidity, temperature, and O_2 percentage. O_2 higher than 2,000 ppm inhibits radical polymerisation; 30%-40% humidity reduces the static effects of printing head movement and induces swelling in pHEMA to ease the interpenetration of the formed polymer spot 9,20,27.4. Even though pHEMA provides the possibility to form an interpenetrating network between the deposited polymer spots and is known to be a low fouling material 28, it has been observed that it has effects on cell biology 29,30. This could influence the interpretation of cells’ behaviour towards the printed polymers as it decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. This can be resolved by double-printing in between the spots.5.  For this work, inert ceramic capillary pins were used for polymer deposition using contact printing technique. Figure 4A is the schematic of the contact printer robotic head and printing steps. Ultra-smooth surface and tubular construction of these pins eliminates cross-sample contamination and improves spot uniformity and deposition repeatability while printing a large library of chemistries 31.6. Optimise the printing pattern via trialling with spot–spot spacing (refer to Figure 4B) in order to achieve a coalescence free coverage of the surface by deposited polymer spots.7.  Consider volatility of the polymerisation solutions to adjust timing of the printing.8.  It is worth mentioning that this platform has the flexibility to utilise inkjet printing as an alternative to contact printing. Trials for proof of concept have been successfully carried out, involving spot pattern adjustments, voltage, pulse, and uniformity. This approach is particularly advantageous for printing on sensitive and/or expensive surfaces.()Figure 4. Schematic representation of contact printing technique and optimising printing patterns. A) The process of contact printing: 1) picking up the polymerisation solution from the source plate; 2) movementof the robotic head to the position coordination; 3) deposition of polymerisation solution via contacting the surface of the substrate; 4) in situ polymerisation by exposure to UV; 5) washing and vacuuming of the pin for the next material. B. Optimising printing patterns to address coalescence issues. Image shows trials B, C, D, and E and achieving uniform thin polymer layers (spot F) by minimising coalescence via xy-axes adjustments.# Part III. Provision of confined area for each polymer# A. Preparation of the microchambersProPlate® are reusable and should be thoroughly cleaned before and after each experiment to remove any dust, particles, or contaminants, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer and summarised below:1. Make a washing solution by adding 0.1% (v/v) Tween ^mathbbR20 to PBS.2. Soak the chamber and clips in a clean container for 15 minutes in the washing solution.3. Rinse three times with deionised distilled water.4. Soak in isopropanol overnight.5.  Air dry before use.# B. Leakage assessmentConduct a preliminary leakage assessment to verify the integrity of the superstructure assembly, ensuring the absence of cross-contamination or leakage between the individual wells. The efficacy of the plates in retaining samples within the designated wells was qualitatively evaluated by adding trypan blue dye into the wells in an alternating manner (refer to Figure 5) and subsequently incubating them for a period of seven days or in accordance with the experimental timeline.()Figure 5. ProPlate® leakage assessment. Evaluate sample retention by adding trypan blue dye to alternating wells and incubate for seven days or as per the experiment timeline to confirm the superstructure's integrity.# C.  Assembly of the multi-well chambers on the printed polymer slidesThis platform integrates contact printing microarray technology with high-throughput microtiter plate processing. Slides with polymer squares were assembled using multi-well structures to provide enclosed areas for each polymer with a total of 16 per slide. Figure 6 represents schematically the steps for mounting the multiwell chambers.()Figure 6. Assembly steps for the multi-well chambers on printed polymer slides.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-199","title":"Use of the Fluorescent Dye Thioflavin T to Track Amyloid Structures in the Pathogenic Yeast Candida albicans","text":"Use of the Fluorescent Dye Thioflavin T to Track Amyloid Structures in the Pathogenic Yeast Candida albicans\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can attach to epithelial cells or indwelling medical devices to form biofilms. These microbial communities are highly problematic in the clinic as they reduce both sensitivity to antifungal drugs and detection of fungi by the immune system. Amyloid structures are highly organized quaternary structures that play a critical role in biofilm establishment by allowing fungal cells to adhere to each other. Thus, fungal amyloids are exciting targets to develop new antifungal strategies. Thioflavin T is a specific fluorescent dye widely used to study amyloid properties of target proteins in vitro (spectrophotometry) and in vivo (epifluorescence/confocal microscopy). Notably, thioflavin T has been used to demonstrate the ability of Als5, a C. . albicans adhesin, to form an amyloid fiber upon adhesion. We have developed a pipeline that allows us to study amyloid properties of target proteins using thioflavin T staining in vitro and in vivo, as well as in intact fungal biofilms. In brief, we used thioflavin T to sequentially stain (i) amyloid peptides, (ii) recombinant proteins, (iii) fungal cells treated or not with amyloid peptides, (iv) fungal amyloids enriched by cell fractionation, and (v) intact biofilms of C. albicans. Contrary to other methods, our pipeline gives a complete picture of the amyloid behavior of target proteins, from in vitro analysis to intact fungal biofilms. Using this pipeline will allow an assessment of the relevance of the in vitro results in cells and the impact of amyloids on the development and/or maintenance of fungal biofilm.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Biological materials\n\n1.

Fiji ImageJ software (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n# A. Identification and validation of amyloid-forming regions present in a protein of interest1.  Download the complete amino acid sequence of the target protein from the Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/).2. Copy and paste the primary sequence of the studied protein on the TANGO amyloid prediction tool (http://tango.crg.es/). The software will predict the presence of amyloid-forming regions in the primary sequence and, therefore, the potential of the protein to be assembled as an amyloid structure. Note: TANGO provides a  -aggregation potential for every amino acid of the sequence. The higher the  - aggregation potential for an amino acid, the more likely that it is involved in the formation of an amyloid structure. This step will allow the identification of regions within the primary sequence of the protein that could be involved in amyloid formation. In our study, we have selected a region with a  -aggregation potential equal or better than 30%. .3.  Order peptides corresponding to regions identified in step A2. All peptides were ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Note: All peptides must have acetyl and amide group at the N-terminus and C -terminus, respectively. These modifications avoid introduction of charged groups in the peptide as well as its degradation by exopeptidases.4. Centrifuge the peptides at 18,000×~g for 1 min to ensure that all powder is at the bottom of the tubes. Resuspend each peptide at a concentration of 100~uM in DMSO (stock solution). Pause point: The protocol could be stopped at this step and the peptide solution stored at 4^°C for up to a month. Note: Make sure that the powder is well resuspended either by pipetting or vortexing.5.  Dilute stock solutions of each peptide at a final concentration of 5uM in the thioflavin T buffer. Distribute in triplicate 100~uL of diluted peptides in a 96-well plate. A solution composed of DMSO, 20mM TrisHCl, 150mMNaCl , and 40uM thioflavin T should be added to the plate as a negative control. Note: Thioflavin T is resuspended at 3.3 m M in absolute ethanol.6.  Incubate the 96-well plate at 37 ^°C in a Tecan Infinite plate reader for 16h . Note: Set up the parameters to record thioflavin T fluorescence every hour with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and emission wavelength of 496 nm.# B.  Evaluation of amyloid structure assembly on recombinant full-length protein1.  Express and purify the recombinant protein of interest. Critical point: Once purified, the recombinant protein should be used as soon as possible to avoid degradation of the polypeptide chain and/or random aggregation. Notes: a.  As numerous methods exist to express and subsequently purify recombinant proteins, we cannot recommend a unique path to produce the protein of interest with high purity. Protein expression and purification correspond to a trial-and-error process. If the behavior of the protein is unknown, several expression systems (Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, Baculovirus expression system, Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell line) should be tested for their ability to produce the required quantity (1 mg/mL) of recombinant protein. We used pET28a to express His6-Pga59 in E. coli SHuffle strain (Lobstein et al., 2012). b. The appropriate chromatography strategy should be carefully designed to reach a protein purity as high as 95%. . In our case, proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies with a solution containing 6:M guanidium hydrochloride, refolded by dialysis, and purified by affinity chromatography (α-HIS tag). It is highly recommended to assess the purity of proteins using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis.2.  Make a 10-time dilution of the recombinant protein in the dialysis buffer (final volume: 100~uL ). Transfer the diluted protein in a quartz cuvette and measure its concentration using UV-spectrophotometry at 280 nm. Caution: As the recombinant protein is purified under the monomeric form, the protein concentration must be kept low (5-10mM) to avoid unwanted random aggregation. Note: The concentration is determined by applying the Beer-Lambert’s law A~=~varepsilon l c , where A is the absorbance at 280 nm, ε the molar extinction coefficient, l the length of the optical path, and c the concentration. ε can be calculated by inserting the primary sequence of the protein in the Expasy ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). If the protein has no aromatic residues (tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine), the absorbance should be measured at 2I4 nm (absorbance of peptidic bonds).3.  Dilute recombinant proteins at 5uM in 300uL of thioflavin T buffer and distribute triplicates (3×100uL) of each mix in 96-well plates. Critical point: Before starting the thioflavin T staining assay, the recombinant protein must be present under the monomeric form. Starting the amyloidogenesis with preexisting aggregates in the mixture will impair amyloid assembly and hence the results of the thioflavin T staining.4.  As described in step A6, incubate the plate at 37~^°C in a Tecan Infinite plate reader for 16h . Measure the fluorescence every hour to monitor amyloidogenesis.# C. Thioflavin T staining of amyloid structures on intact fungal cells upon adhesion1.  Isolated colonies of C. albicans are inoculated in 4mL of YPD medium and incubated under shaking (220 rpm) overnight at 30^°C . Note: According to the protein of interest, the appropriate genetic background should be constructed to perform experiments for section C (e.g., knockout cells).2.  The same day as C. . albicans precultures, wash 200~uL of magnetic beads twice with PBS.3.  Resuspend the beads in 1~mL of heat-denatured BSA ( ~1~mg/mL ) and incubate at 37~^°C overnight on a benchtop rotator. Note: To denature BSA, incubate the solution for 1 h in a water bath at 70^°C.4. The day after, dilute 20uL of the culture in 980~uL of YPD. Transfer in a 1mL plastic cuvette and measure the optical density OD at 600nm(OD_600) . Caution: If OD_600 of cell dilution is above 1, it is likely that it is outside of the linearity zone of the spectrophotometer. Therefore, to be precise about cells’ quantity, samples should be diluter further to have an OD_600 between 0.1 and 1.5.  Dilute the overnight culture to an OD_600 of 0.3 in 5mL of fresh YPD medium. Then, incubate cells for four additional hours under shaking 220rpm) at 30 ^°C . Note: Cells should be at mid-logarithmic phase before starting the ThT staining (OD600 around 0.8 or 1).6. Centrifuge 10^8 yeast cells at 956×g for 4 min and wash them twice with sterile PBS. Note: The quantity of cells is determined by measuring the O D_600 with a spectrophotometer. One milliliter of C. albicans culture at OD600 of 1 corresponds to 2×I0^7 fungal cells.7.  Resuspend fungal cells in 1mL of SD complete medium containing 25uM of ThT and 10^6 magnetic beads treated with heat-denatured BSA. Incubate the cells at room temperature on a benchtop rotator for 1~h~ . Note: At this step, the impact of amyloid peptides on fungal adhesion can be assessed on a wild-type strain of C. albicans. For this, proceed exactly as described in steps C1–C5, but at step C6 add 5 mu M of the peptide of interest in the SD medium.8. Drop 10~uL of fungal cells on a glass slide and add a coverslip on top of the droplet. Observe the presence of amyloid structure by recording the ThT signal with the blue filter of an epifluorescence microscope.# D. Heterologous expression of amyloidogenic proteins in S. cerevisiaeNote: If too much redundancy arises between the protein of interest and other proteins from the host organism, it could be very difficult to observe phenotypes using ThT staining. One alternative would be to heterologously express the protein in another microorganism such as S. cerevisiae.1.  Inoculate S. cerevisiae from isolated colonies in 4mL of SC-Ura medium and incubate overnight at 30^°C . Prepare magnetic beads as described in step C2.2. The day after, dilute 20uL of the overnight culture in 980~uL of YPD, transfer the entire volume in a plastic cuvette, and measure the OD_600nm .3. Dilute the preculture of S_ . cerevisiae cells to an OD_600 of 0.5 in 4mL of fresh SC-Ura medium. Incubate cells with agitation (220rpm) at 30^°C for 4h .4. Centrifuge yeast cells at 956×g for 3min and resuspend the resulting pellet in 1~mL of SC-Ura medium.5.  Then, treat the cell suspension simultaneously with 10^6 BSA-coated magnetic beads and 25~uM of ThT. Incubate the mixture on a benchtop rotator at room temperature for 1h . Note: At this step, fluorescent dyes targeting specific cellular compartments can be added to perform colocalization experiments with the signal generated by the ThT. As our amyloids of interest are assembled in the cell wall, we used Concanavalin A Alexa Fluor 594-conjugate as cell wall marker.6. Centrifuge cells at 956×g for 3min and wash the pellet twice with 1~mL of PBS.7.  Add a droplet of fungal cells 10 uL) on a glass slide and cover with a coverslip. Monitor the ThT signal using epifluorescence microscopy with the blue filter.# E.  Isolation of amyloid material from fungal cellsNote: To study the effect of various stimuli on amyloidogenesis in fungal cells, whole amyloid material could be isolated by cell fractionation (Kryndushkin et al., 2017) and subsequently stained with thioflavin T. We used this approach to show the formation of amyloids in C. albicans upon adhesion.1.  Inoculate fungal cells in 50mL of YPD medium and incubate the flasks at 30^°C overnight under agitation (220rpm) . Note: Prepare a solution of beads with heat-denatured BSA as described in step C2.2.  The day after, measure the OD_600 of the preculture as described in step C3.3.  Dilute overnight culture to an OD_600 of 0.3 in 1~L~ of YPD medium. Incubate cells at 30~^°C for 4~h with shaking (220rpm) . Caution: To ensure good oxygenation of fungal cells, the 1 L YPD culture should be performed in two flasks of 2 :L(2×500mL) .4.  Transfer the cultures in 500mL centrifuge bottles and centrifuge (Sorvall centrifuge) fungal cells at 956× _g for 10min .5.  Resuspend the pellet in 50mL of SD medium and transfer the cell suspension in a 50mL Falcon tube. Add 1.25×10^7 BSA-coated beads to the mixture, except for the negative control, and insert Falcon tubes on a benchtop rotator. Incubate cells for 1~h~ at room temperature.6.  Centrifuge fungal cells at 956× g for 4~min (Eppendorf 5810~R centrifuge). Discard the supernatant and store pellets at -80^°C until needed. Pause point: The frozen pellet can be stored at -80~^°C for months before being processed for amyloids extraction.7.  Thaw pellets on ice and wash once with cold PBS. Centrifuge at 956×g for 4 min and discard the supernatant.8.  Resuspend pellets with 4~mL of lysis buffer and distribute the entire volume in 1.5mL screw-cap tubes ( 600~uL per tube). To each screw-cap tube, add 200~uL of 0.5mm glass beads.9.  Mechanically disrupt yeast cells with a Bullet Blender bead beater using a cycle of six times for 1~min at full speed. Centrifuge the protein mixture at 800×g for 5:min at 4^°C in a tabletop centrifuge. Take out the supernatant that contains amyloid materials and transfer it in a clean 1.5mL Eppendorf tube. Note: Between each cycle, incubate the lysates on ice for 1 min.10. Incubate protein extracts with RNase A (0.1:mg/mL) ) at room temperature for 10min . Add Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.5% and incubate on ice for 10min . Centrifuge the lysate at 2,000×g for 10min at 4^°C . Discard the pellet and transfer the supernatant in a new 1.5mL Eppendorf tube.11. Load the supernatant from the previous step on a 2~mL sucrose layer (40%) . Centrifuge samples at 200,000×g for 2h at 4^°C . Note: Make sure to use an ultracentrifuge tube for this step to avoid plastic collapsing at 200,000× g .12. Resuspend the pellet in 200~uL of amyloid-prion resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a pipette. Incubate the mix for 10min at 37~^°C in a ThermoMixer device without shaking.13. Centrifuge the solution at 5,000×g for 10min in a tabletop centrifuge. Save the resulting supernatant in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube and discard the pellet.14. For each 100~uL of amyloid preparation, add 0.01% of bromophenol blue and 5% of glycerol. Mix well and load the solution on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Run the gel first for 15min at 70V and then switch to 200V for 40min . Use as many wells as required according to your sample volume.15. Wash the polyacrylamide gel in distilled water once and cut out the top part 3mm, of the stacking gel with a scalpel. Pool all gel sections per sample in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube and freeze gel squares at -20^°C for at least 20min .16. To each tube, subsequently add 200~uL of amyloid-prion buffer R, vortex for 10s , and incubate for 15min at 98 ^°C . Then, vortex and centrifuge at 4,000×g for 1 min . Take out the supernatant and drop it in a new 1.5mL tube. Repeat this step twice. Note: All supernatants must be pooled.17. Quantify proteins in each sample using a classical Bradford assay. Pause point: At this point, the protocol can be stopped, and amyloids stored at -20~^°C until thioflavin T staining assays.18. Dilute the amyloid-enriched fraction at a final concentration of 100~uM in 300~uL of thioflavin T buffer. Distribute 100~uL of amyloid fractions in a 96-well plate in triplicate. A solution composed of DMSO, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150mMNaCl , and 40~uM thioflavin T should be used as a negative control.19. Incubate the 96-well plate at 37^°C in a Tecan Infinite plate reader for 16h . Record ThT fluorescence every hour.# F.  Track the presence of amyloid structures in intact biofilms of C. albicansNote: C. albicans biofilms can be grown on a plastic surface (Aclar film) before being stained with ThT and then imaged with a confocal microscope to observe the presence of amyloid structures.1.  Inoculate C. albicans cells in 4mL of YPD medium and incubate overnight at 30 ^°C .2.  Coat the Aclar film with a freshly made poly-L-lysine solution (0.1%) for 30min at 37 ^°C . Wash the Aclar film twice with distilled water, cut it in small squares 1~cm×1~cm) ), and finally sterilize each side under UV light for 15min .3.  The day after, wash yeast cells twice with sterile PBS and dilute fungal cells at 1.10^6 cells/mL in RPMI medium. Note: The RPMI medium should be prewarmed at 37~^°C before use.4.  Place sterile Aclar film squares in wells from a 12-well tissue culture plate. Add 3~mL of diluted cells to each well.5.  Incubate fungal cells for 1h at 37 ^°C with moderate shaking ( 110rpm) in an Infors HT Multitron to allow adhesion of C . albicans to the plastic surface. Then, remove non-adherent cells by washing the wells twice with 1~mL of sterile PBS and fill up with 3mL of prewarmed RPMI medium (37 ^°C) .6.  Incubate the culture plates at 37 ^°C for 48h at 110rpm .7.  Wash mature biofilms once with PBS and stain with 2~mL of PBS containing 25~uM of ThT. Caution: In order to prevent the biofilm to be detached from the Aclar film, the fungal community should be washed gently.8.  Wash biofilms two times with PBS and transfer them in a 35~mm Petri dish. Cover C. albicans biofilms with 2~mL of PBS and image using the blue channel of a confocal microscope. Critical point: The objective of the microscope will be immersed in the culture medium. To avoid any damage, make sure to use an immersion objective. Note: We record Z-stacks on a LSM700 upright using a 40× immersion objective. We then reconstruct the volume using Fiji ImageJ software.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Identification and Validation of Amyloid-Forming Regions\n## Download Protein Sequence\nDownload the complete amino acid

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-211","title":"Optical Modulation of the Blood–Brain Barrier for Glioblastoma Treatment","text":"Optical Modulation of the Blood–Brain Barrier for Glioblastoma Treatment\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to the diagnostics and treatment of many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. A prime example of this challenge is seen in glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumor. The BBB in brain tumors, or the blood–brain–tumor barrier (BBTB), prevents the efficient delivery of most therapeutics to brain tumors. Current strategies to overcome the BBB for therapeutic delivery, such as using hyperosmotic agents (mannitol), have impeded progress in clinical translation limited by the lack of spatial resolution, high incidences of complications, and potential for toxicity. Focused ultrasound combined with intravenously administered microbubbles enables the transient disruption of the BBB and has progressed to early-phase clinical trials. However, the poor survival with currently approved treatments for GBM highlights the compelling need to develop and validate treatment strategies as well as the screening for more potent anticancer drugs. In this protocol, we introduce an optical method to open the BBTB (OptoBBTB) for therapeutic delivery via ultrashort pulse laser stimulation of vascular targeting plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Specifically, the protocol includes the synthesis and characterization of vascular-targeting AuNPs and a detailed procedure of optoBBTB. We also report the downstream characterization of the drug delivery and tumor treatment efficacy after BBB modulation. Compared with other barrier modulation methods, our optical approach has advantages in high spatial resolution and minimally invasive access to tissues. Overall, optoBBTB allows for the delivery of a variety of therapeutics into the brain and will accelerate drug delivery and screening for CNS disease treatment.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Biological materials\n\n1.

Prepare fresh aqua regia in the chemical fume hood, by gently mixing 3:1 (v/v) HCl: HNO_3 .2.  Soak the glassware, magnetic stir bar, and condenser in aqua regia for at least 30min . CAUTION: Mishandling of aqua regia can result in significant hazards, including the risk of explosions, skin burns, eye damage upon contact, harm to mucous membranes and the upper respiratory tract if inhaled, as well as potential harm to internal organs if ingested. It is crucial to never seal aqua regia in a closed container, as the gases produced can lead to pressure buildup and potentially over-pressurize the vessel. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential when working with aqua regia.3. Rinse the glassware and magnetic stir bars thoroughly with Millipore-filtered water in the chemical fume hood followed by rinsing with endotoxin-free ultrapure water in the Class 2, type A2 biosafety cabinet.4.  To reduce the possibility of nanoparticle contamination for further in vivo experiments, the nanoparticlesyntheses are performed in the biosafety cabinet by following all strict precautions normally adopted during cell culture.CRITICAL STEP: To avoid nanoparticle contamination, all plasticware used in the synthesis should be endotoxin-free certified. All solvents and other reagents used for nanoparticle preparation in this work were strictly opened inside the biosafety cabinet. All the containers (i.e., conical flasks and dialysis containers) should be rinsed with 70% ethanol and Millipore-filtered water and covered properly with a piece of disinfected parafilm. All reagent solutions are filtered through 0.2um Millipore syringe filters in the biosafety cabinet before use unless specified.# B.  Synthesis of 15nm gold seeds1.  Add 98~mL of endotoxin-free ultrapure water to the 250mL glass round-bottom flask.2.  Add 1~mL of HAuCl_4 solution (25mM) to the round-bottle flask.3.  Boil the solution under reflux and thorough stirring. CRITICAL STEP: The thorough and effective mixing is one of the key steps to achieving homogenous nucleation and growth to obtain nanoparticles with high monodispersity.4.  Add 1~mL of sodium citrate solution ( 112.2mM) while stirring. CRITICAL STEP: The reducing agent should be added quickly to obtain a homogenous nanoparticle growth and high monodispersity.5.  Stir and boil the solution for 10min .6.  Turn off the heat and allow the system to cool to room temperature (23-25^°C) ) while stirring. The resulting AuNPs should exhibit a ruby-red color.7.  Characterize the gold seeds. a.  Measure nanoparticle size and size distribution using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (zetasizer nano zs). The measured hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles is approximately 17n m . The polydispersity index (PDI) is approximately 0.05. CRITICAL STEP: The hydrodynamic diameter of the seeds should be 17-18 nm with a relatively low PDI (<0.1) to grow larger nanoparticles with the desired size and quality. TROUBLESHOOTING: If larger or polydisperse nanoparticle sizes are observed, ensure the solution is boiled before adding the reducing agent. Ensure thorough mixing. b.  Record UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra using BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader for concentration measurements (Haiss et al., 2007). c. Measure the nanoparticle size and morphology using transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1400 plus electron microscope). The nanoparticle shape should be semi-spherical, and the diameter should be approximately 15nm . PAUSE POINT: The seeds can be stored at 4^°C for two weeks. Characterization is required prior to reusing the seeds.# C. Seed-mediated synthesis of 50 nm AuNPs1.  Add 95~mL of endotoxin-free ultrapure water to a 250mL Erlenmeyer flask.2.  Add 963~uL of HAuCl_4 solution (25mM) .3. While stirring at room temperature, add 3.71~mL of the as-prepared gold seeds (2.23nM) . CRITICAL STEP: For gold seeds at different concentrations, use the molar calculation to determine the equivalent volume to be added.4. Under thorough mixing, quickly add 963~uL of sodium citrate solution .15mM) and 963~uL of hydroquinone solution (25mM) . CRITICAL STEP: These two reducing solutions should be added in quick succession to obtain nanoparticles with high monodispersity.5. Stir overnight. Cover the flask with a piece of disinfected parafilm to protect the solution from contamination.6.  Characterize the nanoparticles.a.  Measure nanoparticle size and size distribution using DLS (zetasizer nano zs). The measured hydrodynamic diameter of such prepared nanoparticles is approximately 47nm with a PDI<0.1 .b.  Record UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra using BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader.c. Measure the nanoparticle size and morphology using transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1400 plus electron microscope). The nanoparticle shape should be spherical, and the diameter should be approximately 50nm . TROUBLESHOOTING: If polydisperse nanoparticle sizes are observed, ensure the reducing agents are freshly prepared. Ensure thorough mixing.Concentrate the nanoparticles.a.  Allocate the nanoparticles in 2~mL endotoxin-free Eppendorf and centrifuge the nanoparticles at 1,300×g for 30min at room temperature.b.  Discard the supernatant and collect the nanoparticle pellet in a 2mL endotoxin-free Eppendorf.Characterize the nanoparticles after the concentration process.a.  Dilute the nanoparticles 100-fold using endotoxin-free pure water and perform DLS for size measurement. The measured hydrodynamic diameter of such nanoparticles is approximately 50~nm with a PDI<0.1 . TROUBLESHOOTING: Larger nanoparticle sizes after centrifugation indicate aggregation during the concentration step. Ensure proper centrifugation time and speed.b.  Use the diluted nanoparticles to record UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra for concentration calculation. PAUSE  POINT:  The  concentrated  nanoparticles  can  be  stored  at 4 ^°C for  two  weeks. Characterization is required before reusing the nanoparticles.# D. Preparation of polyethylene glycol–antibody conjugates1.  Thaw the BV11 (anti-JAM-A antibody) on ice, dilute to 0.5 mg/mL in PBS, then dilute in 2~mM borate buffer at p H8.5 to 0.05mg/mL . CAUTION: The borate buffer and PBS should be cooled on ice before starting the experiment. The antibody solution should be kept on ice. Do not filter the antibody solution.2.  Dissolve OPSS-PEG-SVA in 2mM borate buffer and quickly add to the antibody solution at a 125:1 molar ratio. CAUTION: The OPSS-PEG-SVA solution should be kept on ice.3.  Transfer the solution to a 15mL Falcon tube, vortex briefly, and shake on ice for ^3~h~ .4.  Remove the unreacted OPSS-PEG-SVA by dialysis. a.  Disinfect a plastic container with 70% ethanol, followed by rinsing with Millipore-filtered water and then rinsing with endotoxin-free ultrapure water. Fill the container with 3L of borate buffer ( 2mM , pH8.5AA ). Cover the container with disinfected parafilm and aluminum film. Cool the buffer to 4~^°C . b.  Immerse a 20 kDa MWCO membrane in the borate buffer for at least 30min to activate the membrane. c. Fill the dialysis bag with the antibody-PEG mixture, followed by dialysis at 4^°C overnight to remove free OPSS-PEG-SVA under mild stirring. CRITICAL STEP: To ensure the thorough removal of the free OPSS-PEG-SVA, the borate buffer can be replaced after dialysis for ^3~h~ .# E. Functionalization of AuNPs with polyethylene glycol–antibody conjugates1.  Collect the thiolated antibodies in a 15mL Falcon tube and mix the solution with concentrated AuNPs at a 200:1 molar ratio. Shake the nanoparticle–antibody solution for 1 h on ice.2.  Add mPEG-thiol solution 1,000 Da) at 6~PEG/nm^2 to backfill the empty space of AuNPs. Shake the solution for 1 h on ice.3.  Purify the resulting AuNP-BV11 conjugates by centrifugation ( 1,300×~g , 30 min , 4 ^°C_. ) with ice-cold borate buffer (2 mM, pH 8.5). Repeat the process three times to remove excess antibodies.4.  Dilute the nanoparticles 500-fold using borate buffer 2mM_ and characterize the nanoparticles by DLS and  UV-Vis-NIR  absorption  spectra.  The  measured  diameter  of  these  nanoparticles  should  be approximately 70~~nm and  the  nanoparticle  concentration  approximately 20~~nM .  Representative characterization of AuNP and AuNP-BV11 is shown in Figure 1.PAUSE POINT: AuNP-BV11 can be stored at 4^°C for up to two weeks.()Figure 1. Characterization of the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). (A) The morphology and size of the AuNP core are characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The size of the nanoparticles 50pm4 nm) was measured with ImageJ by manually counting 100 particles. (B) The localized surface plasmon resonance peaks of AuNP and AuNP-BV11 are characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. (C) The hydrodynamic diameter distribution by the relative intensity of AuNP and AuNP-BV11 is characterized by dynamic light scattering.

(2023) and presented with modifications.# F.  Glioma cell culture1.  Culture PS5A1 cells as free-floating neurospheres in DMEM/F12 medium containing B-272% , 20ng/mL EGF, 20~ng/mL FGF2, 20ng/mL progesterone, and 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine. Subculture the glioma cells two days before transplantation to reach 70%-80% confluence to use.2. Culture 73C glioma cells in DMEM high glucose medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Subculture the glioma cells 2 days before transplantation to reach 70%-80% confluence to use.3.  Before cell transplantation, dissociate the PS5A1 and 73C glioma cells with cell dissociation reagent and Trypsin-EDTA, respectively, and resuspended in HBSS.4.  Prepare cell suspensions using HBSS solution to achieve a density of 2×10^5cells/uL .# G. General preoperative procedure1.  At the start of surgical procedures and between surgeries, sterilize surgical tools (World Precision Instrument mouse dissecting kit) with a bead sterilizer for 15min .2.  Clean the operative table with 70% ethanol and cover it with a sterile drape to create a sterile environment for placing sterile tools.CRITICAL STEP: Maintain sterility throughout the entire surgical procedure. 3.  For all procedures, anesthetize the mouse with 2%-3% isoflurane (in the air) and keep them on a heating pad at 37 ^°C . CAUTION: Start the experiment once the mouse has become unresponsive to painful stimuli, such as a tail pinch. Improperly managed isoflurane can be harmful; prolonged exposure may result in adverse health effects for the operator, including symptoms like dizziness, headaches, vomiting, and nausea. The use of an exhaust system is imperative to effectively remove excess isoflurane during the surgery. 4.  Cover the mice’s eyes with ophthalmic ointment.# H. Glioma cells transplantationSubcutaneously inject Buprenorphine ~~mg/kg) into the mice before surgery.2. Prepare glass micropipettes with 50um tips with a micropipette puller (Figure 2A). Connect the glass micropipette with a nanoinjector and set the injection speed to 30nL/min . CRITICAL STEP: Inject slowly to avoid an acute increase of intracranial pressure and facilitate diffusion of the fluid.3.  Glioma cells injection: a.  Stabilize the mouse on the small-animal Stereotaxic instrument with ear bars. Check the stability under the dissection scope by lightly probing with a pair of forceps. CRITICAL STEP: There should be no movement of the skull relative to the ear bars. b. Disinfect the scalp with an alcohol prep pad. c. Make a midline incision of the scalp using small scissors. d. Remove the membranes on top of the skull using a sterile cotton swab. e. Place a thin layer of glue (Henkel Loctite 4014 medical device instant adhesive clear) on the skull and the surrounding skin. Wait 5-10min for the glue to be bonded to the skin and skull. f. Using a hand-held drill, make a single burr hole in the skull at the injection site (Figure 2B). CRITICAL STEP: Use only light motions and avoid direct downward pressure. Stop drilling every 20–30 s to remove bone dust using compressed air. g.  Fill the glass micropipette with tumor cell suspension. Align the micropipette with the burr hole (Figure 2C). h. Lower the micropipette until the tip touches the cortical surface and use this point as zero. Lower the micropipette to the desired depth ( 0.5mm below the cortical surface). i. Carefully inject 368nL of PS5A1 glioma cell suspension or 92nL of 73C glioma cell suspension into the mouse cortex. j.  After injection, allow 2–5 additional minutes of rest time before starting to withdraw the micropipette. k.  Seal the burr hole with box wax and apply a layer of body double to the skull for protection (Figure 2D).4.  House the mouse for three days (73C) to two weeks (PS5A1) to allow tumor growth before starting the experiments.()Figure 2. Glioblastoma cell transplantation. (A) Glass micropipette. The scale bar represents 50~um . (B) Mouse with a burr hole in the skull. The arrow indicates the position of the burr hole. (C) Setup for the glioma cell injection.

Minimal skin opening and laser stimulation of the brain for optoBBTB1.  Intravenously inject (tail vein) AuNP-BV11 into the GEMMs (18.5 and 37~ug/g in saline for PS5A1 and 73C GEMM, respectively) using PE-20 tubing and butterfly infusion set with 27G×% in needle. 2.  Procedures for optoBBTB:a.  One hour after the nanoparticle injection, peel the body double to expose the skull. Keep the skull moisturized using saline.b. Align the laser beam to the tumor area using the minimum laser power (1%) .c. Apply one picosecond laser pulse ( 532nm , 40mJ/cm^2 , 6mm beam size) through the skull above the tumor area (Figure 3).()Figure 3. Setup for optoBBTB. (A) Schematic diagram of a picosecond laser for optoBBTB. (B) Photograph capturing a mouse undergoing laser excitation as part of the optoBBTB procedure. The laser was configured in continuous mode to align its position accurately.# J.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-213","title":"Live Imaging and Analysis of Meiotic Cytokinesis in Drosophila Testes","text":"Live Imaging and Analysis of Meiotic Cytokinesis in Drosophila Testes\n\n# Abstract\n\nAll living organisms require the division of a cell into daughter cells for their growth and maintenance. During cell division, both genetic and cytoplasmic contents are equally distributed between the two daughter cells. At the end of cell division, cytoplasmic contents and the plasma membrane are physically separated between the two daughter cells via a process known as cytokinesis. Hundreds of proteins and lipids involved in the cytokinetic process have been identified; however, much less is known about the mechanisms by which these molecules regulate cytokinesis, being therefore an intense area of current research. Male meiotic cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster testes has been shown to be an excellent model to study cytokinesis in vivo. Currently, several excellent protocols are available to study cytokinesis in Drosophila testes. However, improved methods are required to study cytokinesis under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. Here, we demonstrate a simple method to perform live imaging on individual spermatocyte cysts isolated from adult testes. We evaluate amenability of this in vitro method for treatment with pharmacological agents. We show that cytokinesis is strongly inhibited upon treatment with Dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor known to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, we also demonstrate an ex vivo method to perform live imaging on whole mount adult testes on gas permeable membrane chambers.

In vitro live cell imaging of male meiotic cytokinesis in isolated spermatocyte cysts.1.  Dissection of adult Drosophila testesa.  Collect approximately 10–20 newly eclosed male flies on a C O_2 pad.b.  Decapitate fly heads using razor blade and transfer flies to an Eppendorf.c.  Pipette 400~uL of M3 media into a glass well plate. We recommend using M3 media throughout the procedure. However, Schneiders’s media could be used as an alternate choice.d.  In a separate well, dispense decapitated flies and, using forceps, hold the fly thorax in such a way that the ventral side of the abdomen faces upward (Figure 2A–C and Video 2).e. Immerse the fly in M3 cell culture media and, using another forceps, pinch the distal end of the ventral abdominal skin (Figure 2D and Video 2).f. Using forceps, hold on to the male terminalia and slowly pull away, such that the whole male reproductive system is released into the media (Figure 2E, F and Video 2).g. Using forceps, separate the testes from the rest of the reproductive system. Drosophila testes can be easily identified by their characteristic spiral shape (Figure 2 G, H and Video 2).h.  This procedure is repeated until 10–20 pairs of testes are dissected out in M3 cell culture media.()Figure 2. Dissection of testes and germ line cysts. (A) Decapitated male Drosophila flies. (B, C) Position the fly ventral side up and hold the thorax with forceps. (D) Pinch ventral abdominal skin with another forceps. (E) Hold male terminalia with forceps. (F) Slowly pull away male terminalia. (G) Separate the testis from the accessory glands and collecting ducts. (H) Wash the testes with M3 media. (I–M) Under high magnification, focus on individual testes and, using a pair of needles, tear open the testis muscle sheath. (N–O) All the torn open testes are gently agitated to release cysts into the media. (P) Cysts collected at the center of the dissection well.()Video 2. Detailed procedure for Drosophila testes dissection, isolation of individual germline cysts, and mounting on cover glass bottom dish2.  Isolation of male meiotic spermatocyte cystsa.  Rinse the testes by replacing old media with fresh M3 media ( ^400uL each wash, repeat three times).b. Cut the pipette tip with scissors and prewet it with M3 media by aspirating in and dispensing out.C. Using the precut and prewetted pipette tip, transfer washed testes to a fresh well containing 400uL of M3 media.d. Adjust the SteRio V12 microscope to high magnification (63×) while focusing on the individual testes.e. Using a pair of needle holders that carry tungsten needles with a tip diameter of 0.0175mm , tear open the testis muscle sheath to release all of the differentiating germ cell cysts, including meiotic spermatocyte stages, into the media (Figure 2I–M and Video 2). Repeat this procedure until the rest of the testes are torn open (Figure 2N). Note that this is the most difficult part of the procedure, which could be mastered with practice. We recommend holding needles in a crisscross fashion adjacent to the site of dissection to get a grip on the testis, followed by poking and holding the testis with one pin and tearing with another pin (Figure 2I–M and Video 2).f. All the torn open testes are bundled and, by gently agitating with needles, all the cysts that are loosely attached to testes muscle walls will fall into the media. Subsequently, remove all the other testes debris including spermatid bundles and muscle sheath by pushing them out of the media with needles (Figure 2N–O and Video 2).g. Gently flush the germ cell cysts settled at the bottom of the glass well plate to the center of the plate by pipetting with fresh media (Figure 2P and Video 2). Wash the cysts concentrated at the center of the well with fresh media by replacing old media with fresh media three times (3×400~uL) . If an experiment requires treatment with a pharmacological agent, replace the old media with fresh media containing the appropriate drug and incubate for the desired time with gentle rocking. As an example, we have treated spermatocyte cysts with Dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis 23, at a concentration of 80 uM/mL in M3 media and incubated for 1~h~ at room temperature with gentle rocking. For the control, we have used a similar volume of the vehicle used to dissolve the drug, in this case DMSO (2.5 uL/mL) . As shown in Video 3, compared to control, Dynasore-treated spermatocytes show defects in the assembly of central spindle during early stages of cytokinesis, implicating a crucial role of dynamin activity and perhaps endocytosis in male meiotic cytokinesis.()Video 3. In vitro live imaging of isolated adult Drosophila spermatocyte cysts treated with vehicle DMSO or dynamin inhibitor Dynasore (f80 mumu M/m L) . Cysts are isolated from fly testes expressing tGPH (PH domain of Grp1/Step) and Feo-mCherry ubiquitously. The tGPH is predominantly localized to cytosol due to loss of cyst cell membrane envelop. Live imaging was performed with the 63× water immersion objective and an AOI of 1024×1024 and at intervals of 2 min for 120 repeats. Video shown here represents 10 frames/second.3.  Mounting cysts onto a cover glass bottom disha.  Prewet a 200uL pipette tip with M3 media by aspirating in and dispensing out. b. Using the prewetted 200uL pipette tip, aspirate cysts concentrated at the center of the glass well plate and dispense as a drop at the center of the cover glass bottom dish (Figure 3A, B and Video 2).Note: Poly L-Lysine was shown to be detrimental to male germline cysts (Gartner et al. 2014); therefore, we do not recommend coating glass bottom dish with Poly L-Lysine/Poly D -Lysine. In our hands, coating with low concentrations of Poly D-Lysine (50 μg/mL) followed by thorough washing with water did not show much effect on cytokinesis 3. However, cytokinetic defects are apparent, particularly in the meiosis II cytokinesis, in glass-bottom dishes coated with higher concentrations of poly D-Lysine (200 μg/mL), even after thorough washing (Video 4).()Figure 3. Mounting male germ line cysts in a cover glass bottom dish and moving onto spinning disk confocal microscope stage. (A) Prewashed male germ line cysts were aspirated with a prewetted pipette tip. (B) Cysts were dispensed at the center of a cover glass-bottom dish ( O.15mm) . (C) Gently, 200uL of M3 media was added without disturbing the cysts at the center.

In vitro live imaging of dissected adult Drosophila spermatocyte cysts undergoing meiosis I and meiosis II cytokinesis in cover glass-bottom dish coated with poly-D-Lysine (200 ug/mL overnight at room temperature followed by 3× wash with distilled water). Cysts are isolated from fly testes expressing tGPH (PH domain of Grp1/Step) and Feo-mCherry ubiquitously. Live imaging was performed with the 63× water immersion objective and an AOI of 1024×1024 and at intervals of 2~min for 120 repeats. Video shown here represents 10 frames/second.c.  Slowly add 200~uL of the fresh M3 media to the observation area of the cover glass bottom dish without disturbing the cysts from the center (Figure 3C and Video 2). (Note: The volume of media added could differ depending on the observation area of the cover glass bottom dish used in the experiment). Close the dish with the lid and gently move it to the confocal imaging station (Figure 3D and F). Make sure cysts remain at the center of the dish; cysts tend to spread to the corners if the media level is too low or too high.d. If desired, cysts can be individually separated by gently pushing each cyst away from the pool with a needle, followed by aspirating it with the prewetted pipette tip and dispensing into a cover glass bottom 94-well plate containing 100~uL of media in each well. Individual cysts settled in each well could be examined under inverted confocal microscope to identify the differentiation stage of interest. This approach allows one to arrest the cyst at the desired differentiation stage by simply adding paraformaldehyde (PFA) to the well (final concentration should be 4% ) 3.# 4.  Time-lapse imaging on a spinning disc confocal microscopeWe use Andor spinning disk confocal microscope with the Leica DMi8 base for imaging; however, the protocol described below could be adapted to any other imaging setup. This microscope has Yokogawa CSU-W1 confocal scanner 8 laser lines and also provides epifluorescence, brightfield, and differential interface (DIC) imaging modalities. It also has a motorized XY stage with piezo Z scanner (ASI), Andor Zyla4.2+sCMOS camera, and a range of objectives including 5× air, 10× air, 20× air/oil, 63× oil, 25× water, and 63× water (1.2NA,WD0.30mm) .a.  Turn on the spinning disc confocal microscope and the computer.b.  On the computer, click on ASI console app arrow select M S2O O Oarrow click Connect arrow set x, y, and f Z speed to 5 and exit from ASI console.c. Double-click on Andor Fusion app to open the software.d. Place the glass bottom dish in the slide/Petri dish holder and lock the dish with magnetic clamps (Figure 3D, F).e. Return to Fusion software. In the Navigation window, enter image name and save location by clicking on the three dots as shown in Figure 4A with first arrow.f. In the Protocol window, if a previously saved protocol exists, select and reload it as shown by the second arrow in Figure 4A.g. In the Microscope window (arrow 3), select objective of interest. We normally select 10× air objective first. Go to Active channels window (arrow 4) and select Bright field eyes (BF eyes). Return to the microscope and, using the eyepiece, locate and focus on the isolated cysts (Figure 5A). Use the joystick to move the stage X and y positions and the fine/course adjustment for moving in f Z axis as desired (Figure 3D).h. Return to Fusion. In the Active channels window from the drop-down list (arrow 4), select brightfield camera and press live mode (Figure 4B, arrow 6). Adjust the exposure time to 100~ms (below arrow 4) and adjust the contrast by pressing auto contrast (Figure 4B, arrow 7). Take a snap of the image (Figure 5A) if needed (Figure 4B, arrow 10).i. Switch the objective to 63× water immersion on the Microscope window (Figure 4A, arrow 3) and select bright field eyes from the active channels drop-down list (arrow 4). Go to the microscope, gently lift up the slide/Petri dish holder, place one or two drops of double-distilled water on the objective lens, and return the dish holder to its original position (Figure 3D, F). Note that water on the objective tends to evaporate during longer hours of imaging (>4~h) . Using brightfield and eyepiece, search for cysts undergoing cytokinesis or spermatocytes that are likely to undergo meiotic cytokinesis within the next 10-15min . Prophase/metaphase spermatocytes typically have a round nucleus in the brightfield (Figure 5B, C). Prophase spermatocytes have evenly distributed mCherry fascetto in the nucleus (Figure 5E, F) (Video 5). During metaphase, nuclear membrane is ruptured/perforated; as a result, mCherry fascetto translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm (Video 5). Anaphase cells typically appear as oval shaped, with the elongated nucleus surrounded by parafusorial membranes (Figure 5G, H).j.  Once identified, mark the cyst location of interest on the Multifield window in the Fusion software (Figure 4B, arrow 12 and 16). Find and add up to 2–4 cyst locations to the Multifield window.k. Return to the Fusion software and switch to brightfield camera (BFC)/differential interphase mode (DIC) from the active channels menu (Figure 4A, arrow 4) and press live mode (Figure 4B, arrow 6). Locate and position the cysts of interest to the center of the field using the joystick and update the coordinates for each cyst of interest in the multi-position settings (Figure 4B, arrow 16, arrowhead).l. Switch from brightfield camera mode to confocal preview mode (select from drop-down menu arrow 4 in Figure 4A) and select the appropriate laser channel. Adjust the laser power between 0.2% and 2% and the exposure time range from 50 to 300ms to visualize fluorescence in the cysts (arrow 4). Adjust the contrast in Map channels window (Figure 4B, arrow 8 and 9) by setting up minimum (100) and maximum (150).m.  While in live mode, use fine adjustment on the microscope to scan through the Z-plane and identify the start z-position for each cyst of interest; set it as \"0\" in z-scan settings menu (Figure 4B, arrow 15) and update it on Multi position window (arrow 16, arrowhead). Add laser channels of interest to()Figure 4. Time lapse imaging on Andor spinning disk confocal microscope. Andor Fusion software (2.3.0.48) workstation showing acquisition control, channel manager windows (A), and protocol manager window (B).protocol channels (Figure 4B, arrow 13); Confocal 488 and Confocal 561 channels are selected in this example (Figure 4B, arrow 13). Select individual protocol channels from the active channels dropdown menu and adjust their laser power and exposure times. For instance, in our experiments, 488 laser power was set to 5% and the exposure time was set to 30~ms for tGPH. Similarly, 561 laser power was set to 10% and the exposure time was set to 30ms for mCherry fascetto.n.  Go to Time repeat window (Figure 4B, arrow 14) and setup time-lapse imaging to capture Z-stack of all positions every 2 min for 120 times (or any number of times of your interest).O. Go to Z-scan settings (Figure 4B, arrow 15) and set up Z-scan thickness to 41 um and the optical section step size to 0.5 um .p. Finally, go to the Run protocols window and press the acquire button (Figure 4B, arrow 17) to start imaging. Live data could be viewed in 3D or individual channels in 2D from options in the Image window (Figure 4B, arrow 18 and 19).q. Under the above-described conditions, we were able to image three independent cysts simultaneously for up to 4h without causing major phototoxicity.()Figure 5.

(B, C) Brightfield image of spermatocytes likely to undergo cell division, at high magnification (63×) .

Note that mCherry-fascetto is uniformly distributed in the nucleus of prophase spermatocytes and, as the cells progress into metaphase, fascetto translocate to cytoplasm. As a result, net fluorescence reduces due to the diffusion of fascetto (arrow). (G-I) Brightfield images of spermatocytes undergoing cytokinesis.

Ex vivo live imaging of meiosis I and meiosis II cytokinesis in adult Drosophila testes. GFP-tagged PH domain of Grp1/Step (tGPH) and mCherry-tagged fascetto (feo) are expressed ubiquitously. Live imaging was performed with the 63× water immersion objective with an AOI of 1024×1024 and at intervals of 3min for 100 repeats. Video shown here represents 10 frames/second.# B.  Ex vivo live cell imaging of meiotic cytokinesis in whole mount adult testesThe protocol described in this section focuses on ex vivo imaging of whole mount adult testes; however, we believe this method could be adaptable to testes from all developmental stages and other tissue types of choice such as larval brain.1.  Prepare breathable membrane dish for imaging a.  Take 50 mm Lumox® Dish and turn it upside down so that its flat membrane base faces upward (Figure 6C). b.  Place SecureSeal imaging spacer sticker on the flat membrane base (Figure 6D) and keep it aside.2.  Dissection of adult testes Refer to section A1 and Figure 2A–H and Video 2 for instructions on how to dissect adult testes. Microscope setup for dissection is shown in Figure 6A and B.3.  Mounting adult testes on breathable membrane dish a.  Using precut and prewetted pipette tip, aspirate 2–3 pairs of dissected testes and dispense at the center of spacer well, as shown in Figure 6E. b. Gently place cover glass over the testes on the spacer well without creating an air bubble (Figure 6F). c. Using forceps, gently apply pressure evenly around the cover glass (Figure 6G). d. Carefully remove excess media between the cover glass and dish membrane using Kimwipe (Figure 6H). Note that excess media around the cover glass will be problematic, especially when water immersion objectives are used, as water tends to enter the space between cover glass and dish membrane by capillary action.()Figure 6.

(L) Push the condenser arm back to its position and, using brightfield, locate and focus on the spermatocyte cysts undergoing meiosis.4  Imaging adult testes on spinning disc confocal microscopya.  Place a drop of water on the 63× water immersion objective on confocal microscope (Figure 6I–J).b.  Mount 50mm Lumox dish in slide/Petri dish holder with the cover glass facing the objective and lock the dish (Figure 6I–L).C. Using brightfield, focus on position 3 of the testis (Figure 1A) and identify the cysts likely to undergo cytokinesis as described in section A4i e.g., in the brightfield, prophase spermatocyte nucleus appears round (Figure 5B and C). Once identified, set up image acquisition as described in section A4. Note that cysts tend to move significantly in whole mount adult testes (Video 5); however, increasing area of interest (AOI) to 2048×2048 in Zyla window (Figure 4A, arrow 5, arrowhead) or changing the objectives to lower magnification will reduce the chance of meiotic cysts going out of imaging frame (Video 6).d.  Lumox dish can be reused several times. Remove the cover glass and testes from the Lumox dish by immersing and rinsing the dish in deionized water, followed by wiping the surface with the 70%ethanol.()Video 6.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-238","title":"Phylogenetic Inference of Homologous/Orthologous Genes Among Distantly Related Plants","text":"Phylogenetic Inference of Homologous/Orthologous Genes Among Distantly Related Plants\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe recent surge in plant genomic and transcriptomic data has laid a foundation for reconstructing evolutionary scenarios and inferring potential functions of key genes related to plants’ development and stress responses. The classical scheme for identifying homologous genes is sequence similarity–based searching, under the crucial assumption that homologous sequences are more similar to each other than they are to any other non-homologous sequences. Advances in plant phylogenomics and computational algorithms have enabled us to systemically identify homologs/orthologs and reconstruct their evolutionary histories among distantly related lineages. Here, we present a comprehensive pipeline for homologous sequences identification, phylogenetic relationship inference, and potential functional profiling of genes in plants.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nWe show a detailed procedure for homologs/orthologs identification with large-scale genomic data (Figure 1).()Figure 1.

DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4893.A total of 39 streptophytes (land plants and charophytes), 54 chlorophytes, 9 rhodophytes, and 1 glaucophyte were selected, covering all main clades of Archaeplastida (Table S1). The protein sequences or coding sequences (CDS) and GFF annotation files were downloaded. The used transcriptomes data of algae are available at the 1KP website (https://db.cngb.org/onekp/).2.  Removing redundant transcripts and short genes.Based on the GFF annotation files of each genome, the redundant transcripts and short genes are removed by TBtools: (a) the longest transcript of each gene is retained to remove redundancy resulting from alternative splicing variations (detailed steps are briefly displayed in Video 1); (b) protein sequences length of genes is calculated by TBtools, and sequences shorter than 50 amino acids are manually filtered.()Video 1. Removing the redundant transcripts by TBtools# C. Identifying orthologous genes within large-scale genomic/transcriptomic data1.  Identifying candidate homologs from genomes.In order to identify candidate homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana HLS1 (AtHLS1), we conducted similarity searches with relative stringency threshold (E value <1×10^-5 ) against the protein sequences of plant genomes. For genomic data, the relative stringency threshold (E value <1×10^-5, is used, and the reasons include: (1) gene annotation of genomic data is based on multiple evidences (such as gene database and transcriptomic data), which ensured the completeness and quality of gene sequences; (2) the  genomic  data  in  this  study  is  mainly  derived  from  the  Phytozome  (https://phytozomenext.jgi.doe.gov/) and has high qualities. We provide brief descriptions of files used in the command line in Table S2.diamond makedb --in all_genome_sequences.fa -d all_genome_sequencesdiamond blastp --db all_genome_sequences.dmnd --query AtHLS1.fa --outgenome_out.result --outfmt 6 --sensitive -e 1e-5 --block-size 1.0 --index-chunks 12.  Identifying candidate homologs from transcriptomes. We used a relatively relaxed threshold to search candidate homologs from plant transcriptomes (E value <1×10^-2, . The reason includes the intrinsic incompleteness of transcriptomes resulting from alternative splicing and premature termination. The detailed steps are briefly displayed in Video 2.()# Video 2. BLASTp for AtHLS1 at the 1KP website3.  Filtering sequences with blast-hits. Candidate homologs from both genomes and transcriptomes are integrated into a single fasta file (ID_sequences.fa), and InterProScan database is used to filter homologous sequences without a conserved functional domain: N-acetyltransferase (PF00583). Consolidate the homologous sequences with “N-acetyltransferase” domain into a new fasta file (PF00583_ID_sequences.fa) for further phylogenetic analyses.Interproscan.sh -i ID_sequences.fa -f tsv -appl Pfam o interproscan_ID_sequences.txt# D. Orthologs inference with phylogenetic analyses1. Alignment and trimming of homologous sequences. Homologous sequences are aligned by MAFFT using the following command:Note: An alignment of up to ~200 sequences ×2,O O O sites is suitable for an accurate option (L-INS-i), and an alignment of <30,O00 sequences is suitable for fast option (FFT-NS-2).TrimAl is a widely used tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses. Before trimming, we perform manual inspection for sequence alignment using Jalview and exclude one sequence (in red rectangle) for its error alignment (Figure 2). We use a relatively relaxed threshold (‘- gt=0.13^° : retaining columns that have at least 13% gap-free sites for keeping as much informative sites of conserved domains as possible) for trimming multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The trimmed MSA is further visually inspected to (1) filter the obvious ambiguously aligned regions and (2) retain the regions of functional domains, ensuring a greater proportion of reliably phylogenetically informative sites.()Figure 2. Multiple sequence alignment of AtHLS1 and its homologs. We empirically focused on the alignment region of conserved domains and found an obvious sequence that is poorly aligned (no amino acid residue was aligned).2.  Constructing a phylogenetic tree of homologous proteins. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of homologous proteins is inferred using IQ-TREE 2, and the best-fitting model is determined by ModelFinder. Branch supports are evaluated by the ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) approach and SH approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT test) with 1,000 replicates.iqtree2 -s mafftout_0.13.fas -st AA -m MFiqtree2 -s mafftout_0.13.fas -m Q.plant+I+R6 -alrt 1000 -bb 1000 –bnni-pre 0.13_result3.  Confirmation of orthologous sequences using function domains/motifs. The conserved functional domains/motifs are analyzed by MEME suite. The parameter “number of motifs expected to be found” is set to ten (a common setting for this parameter) and other parameters are as default. Corresponding functional domains and motifs of each orthologous sequence are mapped to the phylogenetic tree using iTOL (Video 3). Two conserved residues (L327 and E346 in AtHLS1) are checked and highlighted in the MSA. Both the conserved functional domains/motifs and residues are used for the confirmation of orthologous sequence (Figure 3).()Video 3. Mapping the domain/motifs to the phylogenetic tree()Figure 3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-274","title":"Preparation of Cardiac Extracts from Embryonal Hearts to Capture RNA– protein Interactions by CLIP","text":"Preparation of Cardiac Extracts from Embryonal Hearts to Capture RNA– protein Interactions by CLIP\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe interaction of RNA with specific RNA-binding proteins (RBP) leads to the establishment of complex regulatory networks through which gene expression is controlled. Careful consideration should be given to the exact environment where a given RNA/RBP interplay occurs, as the functional responses might depend on the type of organism as well as the specific cellular or subcellular contexts. This requisite becomes particularly crucial for the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), as a consequence of their peculiar tissue-specificity and timely regulated expression. The functional characterization of lncRNAs has traditionally relied on the use of established cell lines that, although useful, are unable to fully recapitulate the complexity of a tissue or organ. Here, we detail an optimized protocol, with comments and tips, to identify the RNA interactome of given RBPs by performing cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) from mouse embryonal hearts. We tested the efficiency of this protocol on the murine pCharme, a muscle-specific lncRNA interacting with Matrin3 (MATR3) and forming RNA-enriched condensates of biological significance in the nucleus.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nBiological materials\n\n1.

Cardiac tissue can be highly heterogeneous and composed of different cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Due to their size (lower than strainer cutoff), all these cells are kept during the filtering step, which is mainly required to remove clumps and tissue debris. To maintain in vivo interactions, we recommend the use of freshly collected hearts as cells need to be cross-linked while they are still viable. The cardiac extracts can be used as input for CLIP assay. An IgG negative control should always be run in parallel to the specific IP to check the specificity of the antibody (see sections D–G and 11). It is important to note that at least 1~mg of total extract per condition (IP-specific and IgG negative control) is necessary. In Taliani et al. (2023) 11, a total of 60 hearts (E15.5) were collected for CLIP and yielded 5.3~mg of protein extract ( 0.09mg for each E15.5 heart).# A. Embryonal hearts isolation1.  Sacrifice the pregnant mouse by CO_2 or cervical dislocation as approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee.Cite as: Buonaiuto, G. et al. (2023). Preparation of Cardiac Extracts from Embryonal Hearts to Capture RNA–protein Interactions by CLIP. Bio-protocol 13(20): e4857. DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.48572.  Wet the skin and the fur of the mouse with 70% ethanol to avoid samples contamination with mice hair.3.  Position the mouse under the hood. Pinch the skin with tweezers, pull up and incise and pull apart the skin to expose the abdomen. Cut the peritoneum: you will see all the embryos contained in the placenta (Figure 1A, upper panel).4.  Carefully cut the placenta to extract the embryos. Place the embryos in a Petri dish filled with PBS to wash away the blood (Figure 1A, lower panel).5. Cut the heads of the embryos and open the chest cavity to collect the hearts (Figure 1B). Depending on the developmental stage (E10.5–E15.5), hearts can be very small (1-3 mm) .6.  Transfer the hearts to a 1.5mL tube with 1~mL of cold PBS buffer.Tip: To facilitate manual dissociation (section B_. ), do not store more than 5–6 hearts in a single 1.5 mL tube.()Figure 1. Collection of developing hearts from mouse embryos. A. Representative image of mouse (E15.5) embryos enveloped in the placenta sack. Isolated single embryos are shown below. B. Zoom-in image of representative E15.5 mouse embryo and heart. Ruler is shown for measurement assessment.# B. Manual dissociationAttention: Prepare 1 mL of dissociation media. This volume is intended for 10–12 E15.5 embryonal hearts. 1.  Carefully remove as much PBS as possible to let the hearts settle down to the bottom of the tube (Figure 2A, left).()Figure 2. Preparation of cardiac extract. A. 1.5mL tubes containing E15.5 hearts (n=5) resuspended in PBS before (left) and after (right) manual dissociation with a pestle. B. Graphic representation of the procedure used to speed up dissociation by trapping the embryonal hearts between pestle and tube.2.  Add 500~uL of cold dissociation media to each tube (5–6 hearts).3.  Mash the hearts with a pestle for 2-4min on ice.4.  Further dissociate the tissue by pipetting the solution with a 1,000~uL tip until no big clumps of tissue can be observed (Figure 2A, right).Tip: For a faster dissociation, trap the hearts between the pestle and the edge of the 1.5 mL tube (Figure 2B).It is possible to follow the dissociation state by looking through the tube against a source of light.# C. Cardiac cells preparation1. Place the 70um strainer (Neonatal Heart Dissociation Kit) on a 15mL tube on ice. 2. Slowly add the cardiac homogenates to the strainer with a P1000 pipette. The solution will be filtered with gravity (Video 1).()# Video 1. Filtration of cardiac homogenates using a cell strainer3.  Wash the strainer with PBS until 5mL of volume is reached in total.4.  Use a cell lifter to facilitate the filtration process by gently scraping the top of the strainer. Be careful not to break the filter membrane (Video 2).()Video 2.

Tip: Slightly move the plate, and consequently the media, to better visualize the translucent cells under a brightfield light microscope. Cells should stay in suspension (Figure 3). To visualize the cardiac cells, fluorescent or colorimetric dyes can also be used on a small volume of the filtered homogenates.()Figure 3. Cardiac cells preparation. Representative image of freshly isolated cells before UV-crosslinking step. Black arrows indicate examples of viable cells.# D. Extract preparation1.  Remove the plate lid and UV-crosslink the cells in a Spectrolinker UV Crosslinker at 254nM with 4,000 uJ/cm^2 on ice.2.  Harvest the cells using a cell strainer and transfer the cell suspension to a 15mL tube.3. Centrifuge at 600×g for 5:min at 4^°C .4.  Remove the supernatant very gently to avoid disturbing the cell pellet and snap-freeze the cell pellet on liquid nitrogen. Pellets can be stored at -80~^°C for up to 12 months. Attention: To proceed with extract preparation, scale up the number of hearts and repeat sections A–B.5. Resuspend the frozen pellets in 3mL of NP40 lysis buffer.6. Pipette up and down with a P1000 pipette until the solution becomes homogeneous. Split the volume evenly in three 1.5mL tubes (1,000~uL each).7.  Incubate the tubes for 10min at 4^°C with gentle shaking.8.  Perform six cycles of sonication at low intensity (see instrument manual) for 30s at 4^°C with a Bioruptor Plus sonication device to ensure nuclear membrane lysis.9.  Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 5~min at 4:^°C and collect the supernatant, which represents the total cellular extract. Attention: After centrifugation, the supernatant should be clear. If the sample is still turbid, perform an additional centrifugation ^16,000× g for 5min at 4^°C ) and repeat steps D5–D9 using a lower quantity of NP40 lysis buffer ( ~ddot~~l~m L~~ instead of 3mL ).10. Quantify the protein extract concentration with Bradford assay. Then, dilute the sample in supplemented NP40 lysis buffer to adjust the final concentration to 1~mg/mL .# E. Beads loadingAttention: Prepare 1 mL of PBT supplemented with I× P I C and 1:200/400 Ribolock. This volume is intended for the 2 h incubation of two reactions (IP and IgG). The washing volume is not included.1.  For each immunoprecipitation, use two 1.5 mL tubes labeled IP (protein-specific) and IgG (negative control). Gently mix the Dynabeads Protein G magnetic particles and add 30~uL of beads to each tube. 2.  Wash the beads by adding 1 mL of PBT per tube.3.  Place the tubes on the magnetic rack. Let the beads settle towards the magnetic rack and carefully remove all the supernatant.4. Repeat steps E2–E3. Carefully, aspirate the last PBT wash without touching the beads.5.  Remove tubes from the magnetic rack and resuspend the beads in 400~uL of PBT by pipetting.6. Add the same amount of IP-specific or IgG antibodies to the corresponding tubes. Use antibody (Ab) amounts recommended by the manufacturer (usually 5-10~ug of Ab/condition). Attention: Use the same Ab isotype for IP and IgG in order to use the same beads in the following section (F).7.  Incubate at room temperature on a rotating wheel for 2h .# F.  Immunoprecipitation (IP)1.  Wash the IP-specific and IgG-loaded beads twice at room temperature with 1mL of PBT. After each wash, place the tubes on a magnetic rack, let the beads settle, and carefully remove all the supernatant.2. Take 10% volume of extract as INPUT (INP) and keep on ice.3. On ice, mix 1 mL ( ~1~mg) of the extract with the IP-loaded beads and 1~mL of the extract with the IgGloaded beads.4. Incubate at 4^°C overnight on a rotating wheel.5. The day after, wash the beads three times with 1~mL of HighSalt NP40 wash buffer.6. Resuspend the beads in 100~uL of NP40 lysis buffer.7. Bring the INP sample to 100~uL of final volume with NP40 lysis buffer.8. For each sample (IP, IgG, and INP), split the volume in two tubes for RNA and protein extraction. Attention: It is possible to split the 100~uL in different combinations. In Taliani et al. (2023) 11, a 3:1 v/v ratio was used for RNA 75 uL) and protein (25uL) extraction.# G. RNA preparation1.  Add 125~uL of proteinase K buffer and 50~uL of proteinase K enzyme to the 75~uL of resuspended beads (RNA tube) to reach a final volume of 250~uL .2. Incubate at 50^°C for 30min with gentle shaking.3.  Spin the tubes and prepare the sample for RNA extraction by adding 3–5 volumes of Tri reagent.4.  Let the beads settle toward a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. Repeat twice. Attention: Make sure that no residue of beads is left before proceeding. Bead contaminations can interfere with RNA extraction.5. Extract and purify the total RNA to use in gene expression analyses (see section I). In Taliani et al. (2023) 11, the RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol  RNA MiniPrep kit. Other methods can also be used (e.g., phenol-chloroform extraction). INP usually yields 1~ug of RNA in a total of 30~uL of RNase/DNase free H_2O .# H. Protein preparation1.  Add 4× Laemmli sample buffer (10~uL) and 50mM DTT 0.5~M stock, 4~uL ) to 25~uL of resuspendedbeads (protein tube) to reach a final volume of 40~uL .2.  Heat at 95 ^°C for 5min .3.  Let the beads settle toward a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.4.  Store at -80~^°C until western blot analysis (see section I).# I.  CLIP experiment analysis1.  Check the efficacy of the target protein immunoprecipitation by western blot assay. Load half (20~uL) of the volume of each sample (INP, IP, and IgG) into the SDS-PAGE gel. Proceed with protein separation by gel electrophoresis, transfer, and immunodetection. Western blot analysis for MATR3 is shown in Figure 4 upper panel, adapted from Taliani et al. (2023) 11, as an example of the expected outcome.()Adapted from Taliani V, Buonaiuto G. et al., Elife 2023 doi:10.7554/eLife.81360Figure 4. Analysis of CLIP results adapted from Taliani et al.

(2023) 11, the RNA samples were retrotranscribed using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kit and quantified by RT-PCR using PowerUp SYBR-Green MasterMix (hold stage: 2min at 50^°C , 2 min at 95^°C ; amplification: 40× (3 s at 95^°C , 30~s at 60^°C_. ); melt curve: 15 s at 95^°C , 1 min at 60^°C , 30s at 95 ^°C , 15 s at 60^°C_. ). RNA was then sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 Sequencing system.Tip: Check the outcome of CLIP by performing RT-qPCR analysis on RNA transcripts used as controls. Figure 4 (lower panel) adapted from Taliani et al. (2023) 11 shows an example of RT-qPCR on positive pCharme, Desideri et al. (2020) 7 and negative (mCharme and Gapdh) controls for MATR3 CLIP experiment.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction\nThis protocol is suitable for the preparation of cellular extract from UV-crosslinked cells isolated from embryonal hearts.\nCardiac tissue can be highly heterogeneous and composed of different cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.\nDue to their size, all these cells are kept during the filtering step, which is mainly required to remove clumps and tissue debris.\n## Embryonal Hearts Isolation\nSacrifice the pregnant mouse by CO2 or cervical dislocation as approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee.\nWet the skin and the fur of the mouse with 70% ethanol to avoid samples contamination with mice hair.\n## Dissection\nPosition the mouse under the hood.\nPinch the skin with tweezers, pull up and incise and pull apart the skin to expose the abdomen.\nCut the peritoneum to extract the embryos.\n## Hearts Collection\nCarefully cut the placenta to extract the embryos.\nPlace the embryos in a Petri dish filled with PBS to wash away the blood.\nCut the heads of the embryos and open the chest cavity to collect the hearts.\nTransfer the hearts to a 1.5mL tube with 1~mL of cold PBS buffer.\n## Manual Dissociation\nPrepare 1 mL of dissociation media for 10-12 E15.5 embryonal hearts.\n## Dissociation\nCarefully remove as much PBS as possible to let the hearts settle down to the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 500~uL of cold dissociation media to each tube (5-6 hearts).\nMash the hearts with a pestle for 2-4min on ice.\n## Further Dissociation\nFurther dissociate the tissue by pipetting the solution with a 1,000~uL tip until no big clumps of tissue can be observed.\nFollow the dissociation state by looking through the tube against a source of light.\n## Cardiac Cells Preparation\nPlace the 70um strainer on a 15mL tube on ice.\nSlowly add the cardiac homogenates to the strainer with a P1000 pipette.\n## Filtration\nWash the strainer with PBS until 5mL of volume is reached in total.\nUse a cell lifter to facilitate the filtration process by gently scraping the top of the strainer.\nPour the 5mL of filtered cardiac homogenates in one Petri dish at room temperature and check cells' viability.\n## Extract Preparation\nRemove the plate lid and UV-crosslink the cells in a Spectrolinker UV Crosslinker at 254nM with 4,000 uJ/cm^2 on ice.\nHarvest the cells using a cell strainer and transfer the cell suspension to a 15mL tube.\n## Centrifugation and Lysis\nCentrifuge at 600×g for 5min at 4^°C.\nRemove the supernatant very gently to avoid disturbing the cell pellet and snap-freeze the cell pellet on liquid nitrogen.\n## Lysis and Sonication\nResuspend the frozen pellets in 3mL of NP40 lysis buffer.\nPipette up and down with a P1000 pipette until the solution becomes homogeneous.\nIncubate the tubes for 10min at 4^°C with gentle shaking.\nPerform six cycles of sonication at low intensity for 30s at 4^°C with a Bioruptor Plus sonication device.\n## Centrifugation and Supernatant Collection\nCentrifuge at 16,000×g for 5min at 4^°C.\nCollect the supernatant, which represents the total cellular extract.\n## Beads Loading\nPrepare 1 mL of PBT supplemented with 1× PI and 1:200/400 Ribolock.\n## Beads Preparation\nGently mix the Dynabeads Protein G magnetic particles and add 30~uL of beads to each tube.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of PBT per tube.\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic rack and carefully remove all the supernatant.\n## Antibody Binding\nResuspend the beads in 400~uL of PBT by pipetting.\nAdd the same amount of IP-specific or IgG antibodies to the corresponding tubes.\n## Immunoprecipitation (IP)\nWash the IP-specific and IgG-loaded beads twice at room temperature with 1mL of PBT.\nTake 10% volume of extract as INPUT (INP) and keep on ice.\n## IP Reaction\nMix 1 mL of the extract with the IP-loaded beads and 1~mL of the extract with the IgG-loaded beads.\nIncubate at 4^°C overnight on a rotating wheel.\n## Washing and Elution\nWash the beads three times with 1~mL of HighSalt NP40 wash buffer.\nResuspend the beads in 100~uL of NP40 lysis buffer.\n## RNA Preparation\nAdd 125~uL of proteinase K buffer and 50~uL of proteinase K enzyme to the 75~uL of resuspended beads.\nIncubate at 50^°C for 30min with gentle shaking.\n## RNA Extraction\nSpin the tubes and prepare the sample for RNA extraction by adding 3-5 volumes of Tri reagent.\nLet the beads settle toward a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\n## Protein Preparation\nAdd 4× Laemmli sample buffer and 50mM DTT to 25~uL of resuspended beads.\nHeat at 95 ^°C for 5min.\nLet the beads settle toward a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\n## CLIP Experiment Analysis\nCheck the efficacy of the target protein immunoprecipitation by western blot assay.\nProceed with RNA analysis by RT-qPCR or RNA-sequencing.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Molecular Biology Techniques"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-278","title":"Efficient Large DNA Fragment Knock-in by Long dsDNA with 3′-Overhangs Mediated CRISPR Knock-in (LOCK) in Mammalian Cells","text":"Efficient Large DNA Fragment Knock-in by Long dsDNA with 3′-Overhangs Mediated CRISPR Knock-in (LOCK) in Mammalian Cells\n\n# Abstract\n\nAn efficient and precise genome-editing approach is in high demand in any molecular biology or cell biology laboratory worldwide. However, despite a recent rapid progress in the toolbox tailored for precise genome-editing, including the base editors and prime editors, there is still a need for a cost-effective knock-in (KI) approach amenable for long donor DNA cargos with high efficiency. By harnessing the high-efficient double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway of microhomology-mediated end joining, we previously showed that a specially designed 3^ -overhang double-strand DNA (odsDNA) donor harboring 50-nt homology arm (HA) allows high-efficient exogenous DNA KI when combined with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The lengths of the 3^. -overhangs of odsDNA donors could be manipulated by the five consecutive phosphorothioate (PT) modifications. In this protocol, we detail the stepwise procedures to conduct the LOCK (Long dsDNA with 3^ -Overhangs mediated CRISPR Knock-in) method for genesized (1-3kb) ) KI in mammalian cells.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Materials\n\n1.

Principle for design of dsDNA donor primers: Only two homology arms (HAs) with 50 nt sequence are designed at the 5^ end of the synthesized forward and reverse primers. Note: Longer HA sequences generally lead to higher HDR efficiency, but also likely increase the PCR difficulties.b. Principle of design for odsDNA donor primers: i. Likewise, two 50 nt HA sequences are designed at the 5^ ends of the synthesized forward and reverse primers, respectively. ii. Specify the five consecutive phosphorothioate modifications in the synthesized 50~nt primers at designated positions, as needed. “*” represents phosphorothioate (PT) modification. Lower-case letters are HA sequences and upper-case letters depict exogenous KI sequences. We used the first PCR product as a template in order to save the cost of primer synthesis; long primers are not needed. The primer sequences are shown in Table 2.c.  Primers’ synthesis by Sangon Biotech. The dry powder for each primer was first diluted to 100~uM (stock solution) using low-EDTA TE buffer ( 10mM Tris and 0.2mM EDTA, p H8.0 , and then to 10 uM (working solution) using nuclease-free ddH_2O .d.

Transform the competent E . coli (Rosetta) cells with the expression plasmid: pET28b-3NLS-Cas9-3NLSHis (pET 28b-3NLS-Cas9-PCV2-3NLS-His) and grow on LB plates (kanamycin+) overnight.2.  The next day, inoculate one colony into 25~mL of fresh LB medium (kanamycin+) from the LB plates (kanamycin+) and incubate in a shaker 200rpm) at 37 ^°C overnight.3.  Inoculate 10mL of overnight culture to a flask containing 1L of fresh Terrific Broth (TB) medium (kanamycin+) and shake at 200rpm at 37 ^°C . Grow the bacteria until the OD_600 reaches 0.6-0.8 . Note: The optimal growth time for TB is different, which requires O D_600 to be more than 1.0–1.5 prior to IPTG induction.4.  Cool on ice or in a cold room for 20 min , then add IPTG to a final 0.2mM concentration. Continue the shaking at 18^°C overnight (18–20 h).5.  The next day, pellet the culture medium and weigh the pellet. Resuspend the cells with buffer A at 6mL/g .6.  Add 50uL of  -mercaptoethanol to per 50mL of bacterial suspension. Sonication: set up at 35% amplitude, 1.5 s ON, 8.5 s OFF, to get the whole ON time for 10min , for a total time of 66.7 min . Note: The parameters vary depending on the sonicator; the goal is to attain a homogeneous lysate (more whitish in appearance).7.  Spin the lysate at 16,000× g for 30min at 4^°C and transfer supernatant to a new 50mL tube.8.  Filter the supernatant through a 0.45~um filter.9.  Equilibrate a 5mL His-trap column (GE) with buffer A (at least 25mL ). Note: If using a previously used column, it can be recovered through the washing cycle by NaOH, ddH2O, and HCl, and then keep the column submerged in 5 mL of ddH2O. Cleaning of His-trap column: Note: This step is only required for recovery of old columns. a.  Before use, first wash with 10mL of 0.1MNiSO_4 , 10mL of ddH_2O , and finally with 20mL of buffer A. b.  In use: Slowly compress the pipette to ensure that the filter filters out drop by drop (not forming a liquid flow). c.  After use: ddH_2O wash 10mL 0.1M EDTA, 1 M NaCl wash 10 mL ddH_2O wash 10mL 1MNaOH wash 10mL ddH_2O wash 10mL 1~M~HCl wash 10mL ddH_2O wash 10mL Note: The column must be kept in water. Filter to ensure that there are no air bubbles in the column. Store at 4^°C .10. Next purification step using FPLC protocol. Note: The buffer needs to be prepared in advance The filtered column should not be sucked by water and cannot contact other solutions (so ensure that all connections are correct). Instrument settings: place the start buffer in Pump A1, place the elution buffer in Pump B1, select the column connection line of position 2, place the connection point of A1 upstream, and place the connection point of B1 downstream.a.  Wash step: i. Open the AKTA Explorer UNICORN software, select Execute... in Manual, select Pumps B in wash, and then click Inlet. ii. Select position 2 for the middle circle and waste for the filtered interface. iii. Select Pumps A wash after the automatic stop. The steps are as above. iv. Finally, clean the whole system flow, select the flow rate of 5mL/min , pressure OFF, wash for 10 min. Note: Use all buffer A and gradient options as O% buffer B.b. All tubes after elution need to be replaced with new ones. Starting from No. 1, approximately forty 1.5mL tubes are placed in order. Lift the outflow tip up, move directly onto the first tube, and position the column in place.c. Set up the flow rate and channel in the Manual option. i. Flow rate: 1.5mL/min ii. Pressure: System pressure iii. Gradient: Target 4% buffer B iv. Fraction collection-fraction volume: 5mL v. Alarms: Alarm system pressure: High clarm-1.00 Mpa Note: After completing the setting, double-check whether the elution system functions automatically in order.d.  Once the mAU value stabilizes, change the target of gradient to 10% buffer B and set the time to 15 min, in order to wash possible non-specifically bound protein. This gradient takes 15min to go from 4% buffer B to 10% buffer B. Wait again until it stabilizes and the peaks disappear; then, change the gradient to 20% buffer B and set the time to 15min . Note: The safety imidazole concentration for Cas9 protein ranges between 50 and 250 mM. After reaching 250:m M, it indicates substantial absence of impurities if no peak present. Collect the eluent at peaks approximately within the range of 50-250 mM imidazole.Run SDS-PAGE for gel verification of the protein molecular weight.a.  In the peak effluent, take 8~uL of crude protein product from each tube, add 2~uL of SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer (5×) , and denature at 95 ^°C for 10min . Note: The first flowthrough serves as control. Marker: add 5mu L BeyoColor Prestained Color Protein marker 10–170 kDa. Running conditions: 150 V, 30 min.b. Stain in protein staining solution after completion. Note: Microwave for I5s or shake for 5 min.c.  Then, shake for 30min .d.  Check the protein sizes: Cas9 is 163kDa and Cas9-PCV2 is 179kDa .

Protein concentration:a.  Centrifuge filters (pre-cool the 10~K~50~mL~ and 3~K~15~mL filters on ice). b. Add the selected 5–6 fractions of the sample to the pre-cooled 10~K~50~mL~ filter. C. Spin down in the pre-cooled centrifuge for 30min , observe the upper liquid, and stop the centrifuge any time when the leftover is 2.5~mL volume.13. Using PD-10 column to desalt the concentrated samples.a. Approximately 10 tubes of 100 μL of Coomassie Brilliant Blue are required to detect in real time when elute has protein presence and to compare protein concentrations.b.  Wash the PD-10 column with Cas9 storage buffer three times for 5min every time.c.  Then, add 2.5mL of concentrated solution to PD10, followed by centrifugation. Add 500~uL of storage buffer, collect the elute with a 1.5mL centrifuge tube, add 500~uL each time for a total of seven times, and collect seven tubes for each 500~uL product.d.  Take out 3~uL of the product and mix with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, distinguish the blue brightness, select the brightest five tubes of product, transfer to the second PD-10, which has been exchanged with Cas9 buffer, and perform the second desalting.e. Measure the brightness, pick up four tubes with the highest blue staining, and proceed to the next protein concentration. Note: Perform these steps in a cold room; load PD-10 column with less than or equal to 2.5~m L volume.14. Concentrate the desalted protein. a.  Add 2~mL of the desalted product to a 3~K~15~mL pre-cooled centrifuge filter and then centrifuge in a pre-cooled centrifuge at 4,000× g for approximately 30 min . Pay attention to the remaining volume and stop centrifugation when the leftover volume reaches 500~uL . b. Prepare 20~uL aliquots in the 1.5mL tubes in a cold room. c. Store at -80~^°C freezer. d. Keep one tube of product for concentration determination. e. The absorption peak of protein at 280nm was measured by NanoDrop 2000. f.

Note: When the ssDNA probe is cleaved by the Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein, the FAM fluorophore is released from the quenching group BHQ1 and begins to emit fluorescence, which is monitored in real time by a fluorescence spectrometer.# C. Synthesis and purification of sgRNA to target gDNA in HEK293T cells (GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis kit)1.  Design sequences as below for the Target F1 forward and Target R1 reverse primers required for synthetic sgRNA template assembly. Sequences are shown in Table 7: Target F1: TAATACGACTCACTATAG ^+ target sequence (20nt) Target R1: TTCTAGCTCTAAAAC ^+ target sequence reverse complement (20 nt) Note: If the target sequence already contains a 5^G, , you can keep it, which will result in an extra G being added from the T7 promoter primer. Alternatively, you can remove the first G from the target sequence, which will be added back by the T7 promoter primer.Table 7. Primers for in vitro translation of sgRNA()Cite as: Han, W. et al.

Store the sgRNA at -80^°C . Note: All operations are preferably conducted in RNase-free workstation.# D. Preparation of the RNP complex for odsDNA attaching to Cas9-PCV2 fusion proteinDesign and synthesis of the PCV2 linker.a.  Because PCV2 protein recognizes DNA sequence (AAGTATT^ACCAGAAA) in 5^ to 3^ direction, odsDNA has 3^ overhang, and a PCV2 linker is needed as a bridge to attach odsDNA to Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein. Note: “^” represents the cleavage position of the PCV2 protein.b.  The PCV2 linker is divided into two parts: the 5^ end is a fixed sequence recognized by the PCV2 protein for cleavage, followed by subsequent covalent linkage to PCV2 protein, and the 3^ end is a sequence that anneals to the 3^ overhang of odsDNA.c.  The PCV2 linker sequence for the Lamin A/C locus is shown in Table 11.Table 11. PCV2 linker sequence for the Lamin A/C locus()Note: The upper-case letters are the set sequences recognized by the PCV2 protein and the lowercase letters are the sequences that anneal to the odsDNA of the Lamin A/C locus.a.  We use odsDNA with 10 bases-overhang to anneal to PCV2 linker with 10 nt paired bases. b.  Set up the following annealing reaction in a 10~uL volume; reagents and volumes are shown in Table 12.Table 12. Components of annealing reaction()c.  Perform annealing reaction using the cycling parameters as shown in Table 13.Table 13. Annealing reaction to generate odsDNA/PCV2 linker complex()3.  Prepare RNP complex composed of odsDNA/PCV2 linker/Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein. a.  In order to verify that odsDNA/PCV2 linker can be effectively attached to the Cas9-PCV2 protein, different molar ratios of 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 were incubated with Cas9-PCV2 protein and then verified by 2% agarose gel. As shown in Figure 4, when the molar ratio of Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein to odsDNA/PCV2 linker was 3:1, the free odsDNA/PCV2 linker below was almost completely reacted, and all odsDNA/PCV2 linker was attached to the Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.()Figure 4. Verification for the attachment of odsDNA to Cas9-PCV2 protein. Efficient tethering of odsDNA donors to Cas9-PCV2 when the ratio of Cas9-PCV2 to pre-annealed odsDNA/PCV2 linker reaches >3:1 .b.  Add 30 pmol Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein to the odsDNA/PCV2 linker complex from step D2.c.  Because Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein is much more abundant than odsDNA, almost all odsDNA is reacted completely attached to Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.d. The working condition of PCV2 protein requires the presence of at least 1mMMg^2+ . Since the buffer C: storage buffer of Cas9-PCV2 protein has 10mMMgCl_2 , no additional Mg^2+ is needed here.# E. Nucleofection of the odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA RNP complex into HEK293T cells1.  Before nucleofection, sub-culture the HEK293T cells three days prior to nucleofection experiments using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and 10% fetal bovine serum.2.  Nucleofection of HEK293T cells with odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA:a.  Cell preparation i. Optimal cell confluency for nucleofection: 80%-90% . Higher cell densities may cause lower Nucleofection® efficiencies. ii. Remove the medium from the cultured cells and wash cells once with 1× PBS. Wash with at least the same volume of 1×PBS as culture media. iii. For harvesting, incubate the cells for 5min at 37 ^°C with TrypLE Express reagent. iv. Neutralize the trypsinization reaction with culture medium containing 10% FBS. The majority of the cells (>90%) will be detached. The culture medium, PBS, and TrypLE are opened and sealed using PARAFILM sealing film.b. Preparation for odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA RNP complex: i. To prepare the Cas9-PCV2 RNPs complex, mix the odsDNA/PCV2 linker/Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein complex with 90 pmol sgRNA and incubate for 10min at 37 ^°C . ii. Perform nucleofection immediately as below.c.  Nucleofection i. Ensure that the entire supplement is added to the Nucleofector® solution. The ratio of Nucleofector® solution to supplement is 4.5:1.

Prepare 6-well plates by filling the appropriate number of wells with 1~mL of supplemented culture media and pre-incubate/equilibrate plates in a humidified 5% CO_2 incubator at 37^°C . iii. Harvest the cells by trypsinization.Cite as: Han, W. et al. (2023). Efficient Large DNA Fragment Knock-in by Long dsDNA with 3^ -Overhangs Mediated 19 CRISPR Knock-in (LOCK) in Mammalian Cells.

Centrifuge the required number of cells 1×10^6 cells per sample) at 200× g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant completely.vi. Resuspend the cell pellet carefully in 100~uL of room-temperature Nucleofector® solution per sample.Note: Do not leave the cells in Nucleofector® solution for an extended time (i.e., longer than 15 min), as this may reduce both the cell viability and the gene transfer efficiency.i. Combine 100~uL of cell suspension with odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA complex. Table 14 shows the different samples.Table 14. One Nucleofection® sample contains()ii. Transfer cell/DNA suspension into a certified cuvette (sample must cover the bottom of the cuvette without air bubbles). Close the cuvette with the cap.iii. Select the appropriate Nucleofector® Program D-032 for Nucleofector® 2b Device.iv. Insert the cuvette with cell/DNA suspension into the Nucleofector® Cuvette Holder and apply the selected program by pressing the X-button.v. Take the cuvette out of the holder once the program is finished.vi. Immediately replenish with 500~uL of the pre-equilibrated culture medium to the cuvette and gently transfer the mixture into the prepared 6-well plate (final volume 1.5mL media per well). Use the supplied pipettes and avoid repeated aspiration of the sample.Post nucleofection:Incubate the cells in a humidified 37^°C/5%CO_2 incubator until further analysis at defined time points. Nucleofection of odsDNA with Cas9/sgRNA into HEK293T cells showed that universal odsDNAdonors had higher KI rates than dsDNA donors in Figure 5. When Cas9-PCV2 was used to attach to odsDNA, the KI rate was 5-fold higher than dsDNA in Figure 6.()HEK293T cells, 1010bp insertionFigure 5. Knock-in (KI) rates in HEK293T cells with different donors. A panel of three different genomic loci were selected for the 1,010 bp odsDNA donor KI in HEK293T cells. The dsDNA donors were used as controls. Data were collected 15 days after nucleofection. The KI rates were calculated as the averaged percentages for the total number of EGFP-positive cells (donor KI) divided by the total number of RNP-electroporated cells.()Figure 6.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-284","title":"A Protocol to Retrieve and Curate Spatial and Climatic Data from Online Biodiversity Databases Using R","text":"A Protocol to Retrieve and Curate Spatial and Climatic Data from Online Biodiversity Databases Using R\n\n# Abstract\n\nEcological and evolutionary studies often require high quality biodiversity data. This information is readily available through the many online databases that have compiled biodiversity data from herbaria, museums, and human observations. However, the process of preparing this information for analysis is complex and time consuming. In this study, we have developed a protocol in R language to process spatial data (download, merge, clean, and correct) and extract climatic data, using some genera of the ginseng family (Araliaceae) as an example. The protocol provides an automated way to process spatial and climatic data for numerous taxa independently and from multiple online databases. The script uses GBIF, BIEN, and WorldClim as the online data sources, but can be easily adapted to include other online databases. The script also uses genera as the sampling unit but provides a way to use species as the target. The cleaning process includes a filter to remove occurrences outside the natural range of the taxa, gardens, and other human environments, as well as erroneous locations and a spatial correction for misplaced occurrences (i.e., occurrences within a distance buffer from the coastal boundary). Additionally, each step of the protocol can be run independently. Thus, the protocol can begin with data cleaning, if the database has already been compiled, or with climatic data extraction, if the database has already been parsed. Each line of the R script is commented so that it can also be run by users with little knowledge of R.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe R script can be freely downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/NiDEvA/R-protocols; Note 1). The pipeline of the procedure coincides with the steps of the R script of this protocol (Figure 1). First, you need to create two working folders, one called “input” (it contains the information needed to run the R script) and another one called “output” (it will contain the resulting files after running the R script). In this protocol, we used the genus rank as the operational taxonomic unit, but the script also contains commented lines (those preceded with “ #^ullet ) with the functions needed if you want to use species as the sample unit. Besides, it can also be easily modified to use family or any other higher taxonomic level as the operational unit if needed. We have also cleaned the data by removing records outside the natural distribution of genera, from gardens and other human environments, or those that are geographically inaccurate, but it can also be readily adjusted to meet specific data cleaning requirements as needed.# A. Prepare a checklist of the native range of the taxaIt is necessary to know the countries where the taxa are native. For plants, this information can be found in the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCSP, Govaerts et al., 2008). WCSP is a database that compiles checklists of 200 seed plant families, and it is available in Plants of the World Online (POWO, 2023; http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/). The database is frequently updated, and each new name published in the International Plant Name Index (IPNI; International Plant Names Index, 2020) is reviewed and added to POWO. Other sources of information on the natural range of other organisms are available in ASM Mammal Diversity  Database  (https://www.mammaldiversity.org/index.html,  Mammal  Diversity  Database,  2020), Avibase - The World Bird Database (https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp, Lepage et al., 2014), Catalogue of Life (https://www.catalogueoflife.org/, Bánki et al., 2022), Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World (Hassler, 2022a), Global Assessment of Reptile Distributions (http://www.gardinitiative.org/, GARD, 2022), Reptile  Database  (http://www.reptile-database.org/,  Uetz  et  al.,  2021),  USDA  Plants  Database (https://plants.usda.gov, USDA, NRCS, 2022), and World Plants (https://www.worldplants.de, Hassler, 2022b). For plants not included in POWO or for animals, go to steps A1–A4 to manually create the list of countries where the taxa are native. For plants included in POWO database, go to step A5 to automatically create the list of native countries.1.  Create a text file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad ^++ , BBedit, or Notepadqq in Linux), with the names of all taxa separated by “Enter” in a plain text editor. Save it as “Natural_Distribution_Checklist_TDWG.txt”.2.  Go to https://wcsp.science.kew.org/home.do (or the corresponding webpage, see above) and enter the taxon name in the search engine. WCSP uses two ways to describe the distribution of taxa, one in narrative form and the other one through international codes (Figure 2). The international code used in WCSP is the third level of geographical codes of the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG, Brummitt, 2001) (Note 2).()Brassaiopsis Decne.&Planch.,Rev.Hort.(Paris),ser.4,3:106(1854).()Figure 2. Example of Brassaiopsis genus in WCSP. WCSP provides status, distribution, family, and original compiler information of each taxon.3.  Copy each code of three capital letters (just the codes, not the numbers that appear at the beginning of the country code line) and paste in “Natural_Distribution_Checklist_TDWG.txt” in the same line right after the corresponding taxa name separated by “;”. In some cases, symbols “?”, “(?)”, “+”, “†” or lowercase letters may appear in distribution. According to TDWG, “?” is used when the presence of a taxon in a given area is not certain. If this symbol is used within brackets, it is because there is no exact location known within a country. When a taxon is extinct or may be extinct in an area, the symbol “†” is placed after the country code. When the country code is not known, “ +^,, is used. Lowercase letters for the country code indicate naturalization. For this protocol, we have only used the codes with three capital letters that do not have any symbols. For more information, consult the “about checklist” section on the WCSP website.4.  Repeat steps A2 and A3 until all taxa are completed and save the document in the “input” folder. The format of the resulting text file should look as in Figure 3. It is advisable to sort the taxa alphabetically in the text file.BraSSaiopSiS;CHC;CHH;CHN;CHS;CHT;ASS;BAN;EHM;IND;NEP;WHM;AND;CBD;LAO;MYA;NCB;THA;VIE;JAW;MLY;SUMChengiopanax;CHC;CHS;JAPDendrOpanaX;CHC;CHH;CHS;JAP;KOR;NNS;TAI;ASS;CBD;LAO;MYA;THA;VIE;BOR;MLY;SUM;MXC;MXE;MXG;MXS;MXT;BLZ;COS;ELS;GUA;HON;NIC;PAN;CAYEleutheroCoCCuS;AMU;KHA;PRM;SAK;CHC;CHI;CHM;CHN;CHQ;CHS;CHT;JAP;KOR;TAI;ASS;EHM;NEP;WHM;PHIFatsia;JAP;KOR;KZN;NNS;OGA;TAIGamb1ea;CHC;CHS;CHT;JAP;ASS;EHM;NEP;LAO;MYA;VIE;MLY;SUMHeteropanax;CHC;CHH;CHS;ASS;BAN;EHM;IND;NEP;WHM;AND;CBD;MYA;THA;VIEKa1opanax;KUR;PRM;SAK;CHC;CHM;CHN;CHS;JAP;KOR;NNSMacropanax;CHC;CHH;CHS;ASS;BAN;EHM;IND;NEP;MYA;THA;VIE;JAW;LSI;MLY;SUMMerrilliopanax;CHC;CHT;EHM;NEP;MYAMetapanax;CHC;CHN;CHS;CHT;VIEOp1opanax;PRM;CHM;JAP;KOR;ASK;YUK;ABT;BRC;ONT;IDA;MNT;ORE;WAS;MICOreOpanax;MXC;MXE;MXG;MXI;MXN;MXS;MXT;BLZ;COS;ELS;GUA;HON;NIC;PAN;CUB;DOM;HAI;JAM;LEE;TRT;VNA;WIN;FRG;GUY;VEN;BOL;CLM;ECU;PERSinopanax;TAITetrapanax;CHC;CHS;TAITreVeSia;CHC;CHS;ASS;BAN;EHM;NEP;AND;CBD;LAO;MYA;THA;VIE;BOR;JAW;LSI;MLY;SUMFigure 3. Format for the text file containing the natural distribution countries of the taxa. The first element of each row is the name of an AsPG genus followed by the Level-3 TDWG code of the countries where the taxa occur naturally, separated by a semicolon.5.  Additionally, steps A1–A4 can be automated in R for plants included in POWO. We have provided a working example in the code (see point 5 in the code). However, it is important to note that many families are not included in the POWO database, so in most cases it will be necessary to generate the list manually as indicated in steps A1–A4.# B. Create an account in GBIF database1.  Visit the website https://www.gbif.org/. Click on Login located in the upper-right corner of the website, and then on REGISTER (Figure 4).()Figure 4. Home of the GBIF Database. To create an account, it is necessary to fill the required information in the section Register; remember the information included, because it will be necessary later in the R protocol.2.  Fill the COUNTRY, EMAIL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD fields, click on next, and follow the instructions to create the account. It is also possible to create the account through Google, Facebook, or GitHub. Important to remember: save the information filled in the email, username, and password, because it will be used later in the R script.# C. Initial preparation in R1. Open RStudio (Note 3).2. Create the paths in R for the input and output data. These paths correspond to the “input” and “output” folders. Replace the example path with the path of the “input” folder.3.  Install and load the packages needed to run the R script. This packages are “BIEN” (Maitner et al., 2018), “countrycode” (Arel-Bundock et al., 2018), “data.table” (Dowle et al., 2019), “devtools” (Wickham et al., 2021), “dplyr” (Wickham et al., 2020), “plyr” (Wickham, 2020), “raster” (Hijmans et al., 2020), “readr” (Wickham et al., 2018), “rgbif” (Chamberlain et al., 2020a), “rgdal” (Bivand et al., 2020), “seegSDM” (Golding and Shearer, 2021), “spocc” (Chamberlain et al., 2020b), “spThin” (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2019), and “tidyr” (Wickham et al., 2022). The packages can be downloaded directly into RStudio with the “install.packages” function, except for the “seegSDM” package, which is installed through the “devtools” package as it is specified in L63 of the R script. In this protocol we use BIEN (https://www.biendata.org/) and GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/) as the online biodiversity databases for obtaining the spatial data; if you want to include any other online database to obtain records for your case study, you will need to look for the correspondent R package and install them at this step of the protocol.4. Create a vector with the names of the taxa (sample unit). The vector can be created in R (see “Alternative 1” in the R script) or it can be imported from a file (.csv, .txt, .xls; see “Alternative 2^ullet in the R script). For this protocol, we read the file on the GitHub page “Alternative 3”, as we already have the information in GitHub for this example. Be aware that the names and order of sample units must be exactly the same as in the “Natural_Distribution_Checklist_TDWG.txt” file (see above step A1).5.  Read  the  natural  distribution  text  file  built  in  procedure  A  named “Natural_Distribution_Checklist_TDWG.txt”. First, load in R the text file that contains the natural distribution of sample units as a vector. Then, convert the vector into a list. Each item in the list corresponds to a genus (or the correspondent sample unit: species, family, etc.) followed by its corresponding Level-3 TDWG country codes, separated by “;”.# D. Download the occurrence data from online databases (GBIF and BIEN, or the desired database).  Use the package “rgbif” to download the records from the GBIF database. a.  Indicate the username, email, and password created in step B2. Replace the “XX” with your credentials (important to not remove the “characters”). b.  Search the taxon keys of each taxon. GBIF has a key to identify each taxon in the database. In case you use species or families instead of genera as the sample unit, replace rank = “genus” in the name_backbone function with rank = “species” or rank = “family”, respectively. c. Prepare the download request and download data. i. Create the path to a folder that will contain the files downloaded from GBIF and create a folder inside the “input” folder, naming it as “download_GBIF”. This folder will contain the files downloaded from GBIF. Indicate the number of taxa included in the text file with the checklist of taxa native range. ii. Prepare and download the occurrences. The download request is executed with the “occ_download” function, which allows you to establish criteria for filtering the data downloaded. In this protocol, as we wanted to keep only native records with coordinates, we used the arguments explained in Table 1. The “occ_download_wait” function indicates the status of the download, and the code continues running  until  the  status  changes  to  “succeeded”.  The  download  is  performed  with  the “occ_download_get” function and will result in as many zip files inside the “download_GBIF” folder as taxa included in your request. The “occ_download_import” function imports into R the data set downloaded from the “download_GBIF” folder (Note 4).Table 1. Necessary arguments of the occ_download function from “rgbif” package()2.  Use the BIEN_occurrence_genus function from R package “BIEN” to download the records from the BIEN database version 4.1.1 (Note 5). It is necessary to indicate some arguments to start the download (Table 2). We will refer to the resulting data set as “raw.BIEN.dataset” onwards. If there are no records in “raw.BIEN.dataset”, go directly to step E3 to replace the column names and see Note 6.Table 2. Necessary arguments of the BIEN_occurrence_genus function from “BIEN” package. If you use species as the sample unit, then you will need to use the BIEN_occurrence_species function; replace the argument “genus” with “species” with the remaining arguments staying the same.()3.  Save the R workspace with the downloaded data as “1_Workspace_Download.RData”. It is very useful to save the objects created in the downloaded data. If there is a problem in later steps, this workspace can be loaded and thus avoid making another download.# E. Unify the format of the downloaded databases and simplify the database by removing unnecessary columnsIn order to join the information from the two databases, the number of columns and their names have to be identical in “raw.GBIF.list” and “raw.BIEN.dataset”. Note that some columns from GBIF and BIEN have different names and yet contain the same information. In those cases, it is necessary to rename the columns (see below). Columns with information that will not be used in further analysis can be removed in this step too. 1.  Simplify raw GBIF data set “raw.GBIF.list”.a.  Create new columns for future merging between GBIF and BIEN raw data sets. i. Add the “countryName” column to include full country names using the “countrycode” R package and the “countryCode” column. The “countryCode” column includes a 2-letter ISO 3166-1 standard for country codes and their subdivisions. This standard is used by GBIF to indicate the country inii. Add “dataOrigin” column filled with GBIF. This column indicates if the record belongs to GBIF or BIEN; in this case, it will be filled with “GBIF” for all records. b.  Select useful columns to simplify the data set before merging with BIEN. The number of columns of “raw.dataset” is approximately 50; it is advisable to reduce this number. For our purpose, the useful information is inside the following columns: “gbifID”, “dataOrigin”, “basisOfRecord”, “genus”, “species”, “scientificName”, “decimalLongitude”, “decimalLatitude”, “elevation”, “countryName”, “countryCode”, “locality”, “eventDate”, “institutionCode”, “collectionCode”, and “catalogNumber”. Therefore,  we  will  keep  only  these  columns.  We  will  refer  to  the  resulting  data  set  as “simple.GBIF.dataset” onwards.# c.  Export “simple.GBIF.dataset” as a csv file.2.  Simplify raw BIEN data set “raw.BIEN.dataset”.a.  Remove duplicated columns. In the download, the “data_collected” column is duplicated. This is because the “collection.info mathrelmathop: TRUE” argument in the download adds the column “data_collected” in addition to other variables. However, if we select “collection.info risingdotseq FALSE”, we would lose other variables related to collection information and, thus, it is necessary to use “TRUE” (Note 8).b.  Remove records that are also from the GBIF database to avoid replicated data. BIEN data source may contain occurrences that are also in GBIF, this information is available in the “datasource” column of “raw.BIEN.dataset”.c. Create necessary columns for merging with GBIF. Add the country code and elevation variables. i. Add the country codes assigned by the 2-letter ISO 3166-1 standard from the name of the country available in “country” column of “simple.BIEN.dataset”. ii. Add an empty elevation column with “NA” (Not Available information). The elevation is not included in the downloaded information from BIEN, but it is included in GBIF, and we do not want to lose this information when merging the two databases. iii. Add an empty “ID_Origin” column filled with “NA”. This information is not available in the BIEN database, but it is included in GBIF, and we do not want to lose this information. iv. Add “dataOrigin” column filled with BIEN. This column indicates if the record belongs to GBIF or BIEN; in this case, it will be filled with BIEN for all records. v. If your sample unit is species and you have used “BIEN_occurrence_species” to download the data, then you will not have any column indicating the name of the genus. Since this column may be of interest, then it is desirable to run this function to add a column with the name of the genera, named “scrubbed_genus”. This line is commented on the script and, thus, it is not performed in the protocol unless you uncomment it (Note 9).d.  Select useful columns from all available variables. For our purpose, the useful information is inside the  following  columns:  “ID_Origin”,  “dataOrigin”,  “observation_type”,  “scrubbed_genus”, “scrubbed_species_binomial”,  “verbatim_scientific_name”,  “longitude”,  “latitude”,  “country”, “country_ISOcode”,  “locality”,  “date_collected”,  “datasource”,  “collection_code”,  and “catalog_number”. Therefore, we will keep only these columns. We will refer to the resulting data set as “simple.BIEN.dataset” onwards. Note that the R object “ID_Origin” contains the code of the record in the original database but transformed as exponential. To look for the exact original code, go to that field in the exported “.csv”.e.  Export “simple.BIEN.dataset” as a csv file.3.  Match columns between “simple.GBIF.dataset” and “simple.BIEN.dataset”. To merge the two data sets you need to rename columns in both objects to match the following extract names (“ID_Originin”, “Data_Origin”,  “Basis_of_Record”,  “Genus”,  “Spp”,  “Scientific_name”,  “Longitude”,  “Latitude”, “Elevation”,  “Country_Name”,  “Country_ISOcode”,  “Locality”,  “Date”,  “Institution_code”, “Collection_code”, and “Catalog_number”) and following the equivalences indicated in Table 3. If there are no records in “raw.BIEN.dataset”, it is important that you see Note 10.Table 3. Equivalences between information of GBIF and BIEN simple data sets needed for merging data sets. Names of selected columns of “simple.GBIF.dataset” and “simple.BIEN.dataset”, and their corresponding name in the merged data set.()4. Merge “simple.GBIF.dataset” and “simple.BIEN.dataset”. Build the new data set from the equivalence information of the “simple.GBIF.dataset” and “simple.BIEN.dataset” objects specified in Table 3. The resulting table has the information of both data sets, and it has 16 variables. We will refer to the resulting data set as “merged dataset” onwards. If there were no records in “raw.BIEN.dataset”, you still need to rename your “simple.GBIF.dataset” to “merged.dataset”, because it is the name used onwards in the R script (Note 10).5.  Save “merged.dataset” as a csv file named “2_merged_dataset.csv”. This file contains all the simplified GBIF and BIEN information. Or only GBIF data, in case no record was downloaded from BIEN.# F.  Add occurrences from other sourcesThis procedure is only necessary if the data from GBIF and BIEN is incomplete (that is, they do not completely reflect the distribution range of the study case) and the author deems it necessary to include other data sources (such as additional online databases, herbarium specimens, or citations in the literature) to complete taxa ranges. If this is not the case, skip this procedure and go to G.1.  For additional online databases. In this protocol, we will use only GBIF and BIEN occurrences downloaded using “rgbif” and “BIEN” R packages. This step is commented on the R script. However, we provide an optional example using package “spooc” in R. This package can download occurrences from a diverse set of data sources, including Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; GBIF.org, 2021), USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON, 2021), iNaturalist (2021), Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine (2021), eBird (Sullivan et al., 2009), Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio, 2021), VertNet (2021), Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; Grassle, 2000), and Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, 2021). The procedure with this package is very similar to the one already done in this protocol with BIEN and GBIF. The result of the download is a list with as many elements as taxa in the “taxa.names” vector. Each of these elements contains information on the given taxon in the eight databases. Once the “spooc” R package has been run, you will need to reformat and simplify the downloaded databases so that they match the column names and structure specified in step E3. To do this, first go to step E2b and adapt the script onwards to remove GBIF replicates (E2b), create a match column to merge the databases (E2c), adapt the script in E2d to identify the columns of interest, and in E2e export the  results  in  a  file  named  “simple.spooc.dataset”.  Then  adapt  E3  to  rename  columns  in “simple.spooc.dataset” as already done for GBIF and BIEN. Finally, go to E4 and adapt it to merge the three databases (“simple.spooc.dataset”, “simple.GBIF.dataset”, and “simple.BIEN.dataset”).For  georeferenced  herbarium  specimens  and  literature  occurrences.  The  exported  csv  file“merged_dataset.csv” is used to manually add the records obtained from herbaria and literature.a.  Open Microsoft Excel.b.  Import “merged dataset” csv file exported in step E5. i. Select “Data > Get External Data > From text” and open de “merged_dataset.csv” file. A new window, called “Text Import Wizard”, will appear. ii. Select “Delimited” in “Original Data Type” and click on “Next”. iii. Select “Comma” in “Delimiters” and click on “Next”. iv. It is advisable to select “Text” in “Column data format” for all columns of the file. Click on “Next”. This is done to avoid problems with cell format in Excel that occur in columns that have special characters and symbols and, also (and most importantly), in the columns that include the coordinates. Add new occurrences filling all the fields of the variables of the table. When no information is available, complete the field with NA. This format will make the importation of the database to R easier (Note 11).d. Export the table as csv. i. Select “File > Save as”. ii. A new window will appear. Choose the “input” folder as the destination folder for the file. Introduce “merged_dataset_Version2” as the file name and select “CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)” as the file type. Click on “Save”. If you are using Excel for MacOS, then export as “MS-DOS Comma Separated (.csv)” and check that the separators are commas. If that is the case, then run line 260. If separators are semicolons, run the line 259 in R script. iii. A new window will appear to remind you that only the active spreadsheet will be saved. Select “OK”. Select “OK” in the next window that appears.# G. Check the “merged.dataset” objectIt is necessary to check that the data set has the correct format.1.  If you come from step F2, return to RStudio and import the csv file obtained in step F2diii, “merged_dataset_Version2.csv”. This step is commented in the R script because it has not been done in this protocol. If you come from procedure E or step F1, go straight to step G2.2. Visualize “merged.dataset”. Check that the number of columns in the data set is 16. The structure must be a data.frame. “Latitude”, “Longitude”, and “Elevation” must be in numeric format, and the rest of the columns must be in character format (Note 12).# H. Data cleaningThis procedure is focused on cleaning the most common errors.1.  Remove the records that lack decimal coordinates. This was already done for GBIF records during the import in step D1 but is necessary for records imported from the BIEN database (or any other database if you run F1, Note 12).2.  Remove the records with invalid coordinate values (that is, Longitude or Latitude =0 ). This is common in records from GBIF.3.  Remove the records in which coordinates have low precision (for the geographical scale and our purposes, we have removed the coordinates that had less than 1 decimals, this can be modified in the script to meet the precision you need as indicated in the R script).4.  Remove replicated records among databases. Delete the rows that have the same information for the fields: “Genus”,  “Spp”,  “Date”,  “Locality”,  “Longitude”,  “Latitude”,  “Elevation”,  “basisOfRecord”, “catalogNumber”, and “CountryCode”. Sometimes, the same record has been uploaded in different databases; avoiding redundant data is desirable to reduce processing time. Note that this filter is tied to the number of decimals.5.  Remove records outside natural distribution of the taxa. Each record of the database after running steps H1–H4 (that is, R object “filtered.dataset”) is compared with a filtered version (“checklist.filtered”) of the checklist obtained in step A5 (“checklist”), and those outside the natural distribution will be removed. a.  Add level-3 TDWG code to “filtered data” for future comparison with the checklist created in step A4. i. Load the world shapefile with the level-3 TDWG code used by WCSP available in GitHub https://github.com/tdwg/wgsrpd. ii. Select the WGS84 projection to the shapefile using the “crs” function from “raster” package. iii. Extract level-3 TDWG code for the occurrences from “filtered.data” (Note 13). iv. Remove records outside the limits of the level-3 TDWG shapefile. These records correspond to the ones that have “NA” values in the “LEVEL3_COD” column and, also, to those in which coordinates place the occurrence in the sea (because our study case is terrestrial). Remove the “optional” column that is created by default when using the “extract” function (Note 14). b. Divide your data set (“filtered.data.TDWG”) in sections according to your sample unit. Each section is a table with the records of one genus. Be aware that the sections of this table must correspond to the sample unit of your study (family, genus, species, etc.). Check that the taxa names appearing in “Name” column of the “checklist.filtered” that is cleaned in line 445 of the R script are the same as those indicated at the beginning of the “value” column of the same object. c. Filter your data set (“filtered.data.TDWG”) to retain only natural records. Compare each genus (or the  correspondent  sample  unit)  with  the  countries  of  its  natural  distribution.  The “Country_TDWGcode” column of a given sample unit is compared with the corresponding element of “filtered.checklist” created in step H5b from the original checklist created in step A5. The resulting object is a list that contains all the filtered occurrences, and that is converted into a dataframe (“filtered.dataset.WCSP” onwards). Although GBIF database has a column that indicates if the record comes from cultivation, it is highly advisable to run this part of the script to remove naturalized records as well. d. Export the “filtered.dataset.WCSP” object as “3_Cleaning_dataset_WCSP.csv” and save the workspace as “2_Workspace_Cleaning.RData”.# I.  Distribution mapsThis procedure is focused on visualizing the global distribution of all taxa together and individual maps of each sample unit after data cleaning.1.  Create a global distribution map with all sample units as a PDF named “4_global_distribution_map.pdf”. The occurrences of all sample units are colored in red and the surface of the world in grey.2. Create distribution maps for each sample unit as a PDF named “4_distribution_maps.pdf”. Convert “filtered.dataset.WCSP” dataframe into a list in which each element of the list belongs to the occurrences of a single sample unit. Each page of the PDF contains a map of each sample unit (expanding the geographic area in which it appears) titled with the name of the taxon. The occurrences of each sample unit are colored in red and the surface of the world in grey.# J.  Data thinningThe “spThin” package chooses an occurrence and removes nearby occurrences according to the indicated distance in the buffer. This procedure is intended to remove the bias when spatial data is unevenly distributed across your data set, and there are certain areas for all or a few sample units that aredisproportionately sampled. To identify this sampling bias, visually inspect the maps created in procedure I. If your sampling bias affects most or all of your sample units, then proceed with the thinning in step J1a; if the sampling bias affects only one or two sample units, then proceed with the thinning in step J1b. If you detect sampling bias, the thinning is crucial to minimize errors in further spatial-based analyses, such as avoiding overestimation in the bioclimatic data and oversampled areas. If there is no bias in your data set, then you can skip this procedure and go to procedure K.1.  Remove occurrences randomly with a given distance buffer (50 kilometers in this case) from the “Latitude” and “Longitude” columns. You may need to modify this buffer based on the geographical scale of your case study. This is done in the “thin.par” argument of the “thin” function in the R script. It is very important to put the distance in kilometers. The random elimination of occurrences is done by sample unit. In our case study, the sample unit is indicated in the “Genus” column, but you can modify it in the script if needed. a.  Perform this step if you want to apply the thinning to all your sample units. The output of this step is a csv file for each sample unit that will be directly exported to the chosen directory (Note 15). If you want to apply the thinning to just one sample unit, then go to step J1b. b.  Perform this step if you want to run the thinning just in one sample. In this step you will only apply the thinning to the sample unit that is affected by sampling bias. If you have not run step J1a, then select the proper buffer based on your geographical scale (Case 1). If you perform this step because a given sample unit is still affected by sampling bias after running step J1a, you must increase the buffer with respect to the one used in step J1a (Case 2). This step has not been done in the protocol, but the procedure is included and commented on the R script (Note 16).2.  Import csv files after data thinning using R package “readr” from “thin” folder. Import csv files for all the taxa obtained in step J1 if you only performed J1a or if you performed J1a and J1b (Note 17). Continue with step J3a. b.  Perform this step only if the thinning has been performed on only one sample unit (that is, if you run step I1b directly without running step I1a). Import csv file obtained in I1b for the sample unit thinned. This step is commented on the R script because it has not been done in this protocol. Continue with step I3b.3.  After data thinning, the exported files have only three columns: “Genus”, “Longitude”, and “Latitude”. Therefore, if you run procedure I, add all the remaining 13 columns that contain the additional information of each record from the “filtered.dataset.WCSP” object to the data set obtained after the thinning (“thin.occ”, in case you run step I2a; or “thin.taxon”, in case you run step I2b). a.  If you come from step I2a, join columns of the “filtered.dataset.WCSP” to all thinned taxa imported in. Check that “thin.occ” has the same number of rows as “joined.dataset” (Note 18). Check that “joined.dataset” contains all the columns in “filtered.dataset.WCSP”. b.  If you come from step I2b, join columns of the “filtered.dataset.WCSP” to one thinned taxon and add to the rest of the taxa of the “filtered.dataset.WCSP” object. This step is commented on the R script because it has not been done in this protocol (Note 18).4.  Export the joined file “joined.dataset” as a csv named “5_joined_dataset.csv” and save the workspace with thinned files as “3_Workspace_Thinning.RData”.# K. Load bioclimatic variables from WorldClim version 2This online climatic database contains 19 variables with the average values of 19 parameters that represent precipitation and temperature for the years between 1970 and 2000. There are two ways to obtain these bioclimatic variables. Alternative 1 is shown in step J1a, and it is available for all the resolutions available in WorldClim 10,5,2.5:min , and 30 s). Alternative 2 is shown in step J1b, and it is only available for resolutions of 10, 5, and 2.5min .1.  Alternative 1. Download from the WorldClim website and import in R. We use the 30 s resolution, (only available on the website) because it is the highest resolution available and matches the minimum threshold for coordinate precision set in step H3 (two decimals in our case study). For this protocol, we used Alternative 2. If you use Alternative 1, uncomment lines in R code.a.  Go to the following link: https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html. Click in bio 30s, unzip the zip file downloaded named “wc2.1_30s_bio.zip” (Figure 5), and rename the folder as “Bioclimatic _variables_WC2”. Relocate this folder inside the “input” folder.()Figure 5. Download bioclimatic variables on the WorldClim websiteb.  To avoid sorting problems in R, rename bioclimatic variables as follows: replace original names (“wc2.1_30s_bio_1.tif”) by adding a zero before the number or variable (“wc2.1_30s_bio_01.tif”). This is only done for variables 1 to 9.c.  Import bioclimatic variables to R. Remove “_” and “.tif” characters in column names.2.  Alternative 2. Download the standard WorldClim Bioclimatic variables directly from R using R package “raster”. This alternative is only for the resolution of 10, 5, and 2.5min . In the argument “res” of “getData” function, indicate 10, 5, or 2.5 for the resolution selected. Thus, if you chose for a minimum threshold of two decimals in step H3 and select this alternative, be aware that you will be losing precision for your climatic analysis. For this protocol, we used this alternative.# L.  Spatial correction for terrestrial organismsDespite the removal of all occurrences with inaccurate coordinates, it may happen that some of the occurrences may fall outside the limits of the earth's surface according to the limit of the cartographic base used as template. For terrestrial organisms, these occurrences may be wrong (if the distance to the coastal limit is huge) or simply misplaced (if the distance to the coastal limit is small). Because our ultimate goal is to extract climatic data (see procedure L), we do not want to include wrong occurrences, but it is desirable that we do not lose misplaced records. Thus, we need to check for occurrences out of the Earth’s limit to remove wrong occurrences and apply a spatial correction for misplaced occurrences. If there are no occurrences outside Earth’s limits in your database, go to procedure M and proceed with climatic data extraction. If there are occurrences outside the limits, then identify the occurrences that are between the coastal limit and 5 km from the coastal limit (misplaced occurrences) as established by bioclimatic variable 1 of WorldClim version 2 (same limit for the 19 available bioclimatic variables) and recalculate new coordinates so that the occurrence falls in the nearest climatic cell of the template. Occurrences located more than 5km from the coastal limit (wrong occurrences) are eliminated (Note 19).1.  Visualize the distribution of all the filtered occurrences of the case study available in the “joined.dataset” object, using bioclimatic variable 1 as template. The map will be automatically exported to a PDF file. If you have not performed the thinning process in procedure J, uncomment the line 563 of the R script only.2. Convert “joined.dataset” into the spatial object “joined.dataset.spatial”.3. Check if all “joined.dataset.spatial” points are within the boundaries of the bioclimatic variable layer. Occurrences located outside the layer boundaries are shown in red, located in the “outside_pts” object. The maps will be exported in a PDF file. If there are no occurrences in red, go to step M1 (Note 20).4. Coordinate correction. Extract climatic data from bioclimatic variable 1 for all occurrences of the case study and identify which points have no climatic data (NAs, Note 19). The “nearestLand” function of the “seegSDM” package recalculates the coordinates of the occurrences that lie between the distance set in “dist” and the coastal limit to place it in the nearest climatic cell, and thus obtain climatic data. To check coordinate correction, maps with corrected points in green and uncorrected points in red appear in the viewer in the lower right corner of the RStudio screen. The process is repeated by increasing the distance by 1km until a 5km distance from the coastal limit is reached. Occurrences outside the 5km are removed.# M. Extract climatic data from bioclimatic variable layers1.  Convert “joined.dataset” to spatial object and select WGS84 projection (Note 20). 2.  Extract bioclimatic data. We use the “bilinear” method because this method returns values that are interpolated from the values of the four nearest raster cells. The “simple” method returns values in whichthe point falls. Using the “bilinear” method, we assume that the coordinates of the data set have a certain precision error, whereas if we use the “simple” method this error is ignored. Be aware that this step can be time consuming (Note 21). 3.  Join the bioclimatic values to “joined.dataset” in a new dataframe named “climatic.data” and remove “optional” column created during the extraction of climatic data.# N. Visualize and export the final data set as “6_Final_dataset.csv”Save the final workspace as “4_Workspace_Final_Data.RData”.# Notes1.  Any text line preceded by the character f^ulletullet#f^ullet in the R script available from GitHub (“commented lines”) is only intended to guide the user or to provide alternative code to run under specific cases and will not be run when executed in the R console. If the specific case applies to you, and you need to run the functions in the commented line, you need to uncomment the line (remove ^ulletullet#^ullet ) and execute it. To comment on a section of R script press ^LeftarrowC t r l+S h i f t+C^ullet , and it will not run.2.  In case the WCSP geographical information for a given taxon is incomplete or not available, complete the natural distribution of the sample unit in other sources such as literature or other checklists and include it in the text file using the level-3 TDWG code (available in Brummitt, 2001), as mentioned in steps A3 and A4.3.  To run the lines of the script in RStudio, place the mouse cursor at the beginning of the line or selected regions of the code and press “Ctrl + Enter”. If the line is uncommented (that is, not preceded by “#”), it will be run.4.  Check in the “download_GBIF” folder that there is a zip file with the reference of the “gbif.download.key” object.  The  results  are  also  available  on  your  downloads  user  page  of  GBIF: https://www.gbif.org/user/download.5.  Replace the function “BIEN_occurrence_genus” with “BIEN_occurrence_species” when sample unit is species and the argument “genus” by “species” inside the function.6.  If there are no records in “raw.BIEN.dataset” only the object “raw.GBIF.dataset” will be further used in the R script. If this is the case, you must rename the columns in step E3 and replace simple.GBIF.dataset. with merged.dataset in step E4 and continue with the rest of the protocol.7.  A warning may appear when creating the “countryName” column (“Some values were not matched unambiguously: ZZ”). This is because there are records with an ISO code equal to “ZZ”, which corresponds to an unknown country. The space before ZZ corresponds with empty values. The records with ZZ and empty values in ISO code will have NAs in the “countryName” column.8.  If sample unit is species, replace raw.BIEN.dataset,-28 by raw.BIEN.dataset,-27.9.  If sample unit is species, detach “scrubbed_species_binomial” column into “genus” and “temp.spp” to obtain the name of the genus in a separate column.10. If there are no records in “raw.BIEN.dataset” change only the column names of “raw.GBIF.dataset”, continue to step E4, and replace merged.dataset <- rbind(simple.GBIF.dataset,simple.BIEN.dataset) by merged.dataset <- simple.GBIF.dataset.11. When the coordinate columns are filled, the separator for latitude and longitude columns must be a period. Avoid using “;” in fields since Excel exports csv separated by “;”.12. If you have added new occurrences in step F2, replace the object “merged.dataset” with “merged.dataset.2” in the steps G2 and H1 of the R script.13. A warning may appear when all values of shape.level3TDWG are extracted (“In sp::proj4string(x): CRS object has comment, which is lost in output”). It does not affect the result.14. Every time the function “extract()” is used, a new unnecessary column is created called “optional” and it is advisable to remove it.15. Depending on the number of occurrences of each sample unit (genus in this case), this step can be time consuming. Note that the number of csv files created must be the same as the number of sample units.16. If you run step I1b after running step J1a, it is highly important that you delete the csv file of that given sample unit obtained with the previous buffer (step J1a) to keep just one csv file per sample unit (i.e., the last csv file created for that sample unit in step J1b). The number of csv files in the “thin” folder must be equal to the number of sample units in “taxa.names”.17. When creating “thin.occ” the following warning appears: “There were “number” warnings (use warnings() to see them)”. This warning means: “In bind_rows (x, .id): binding character and factor vector, coercing into character vector”. Although this warning does not affect the results, check the object “thin.occ” to confirm that it contains all the information (three columns: “Genus” or “Spp”, “Longitude”, and “Latitude”) exported in csv files in step J2, and that the unzip files are located in the “unzip_GBIF_files” path.18. In case the number of rows in the “joined.dataset” is not the same as in “thin.occ”, it is possible that joining the two  tables  may  generate  duplicates.  So,  execute  line  591:  joined.dataset<- joined.datasetduplicated(joined.dataset,c(“Genus”,“Longitude”,“Latitude”)),. This  is  done  to  remove duplicates and check the number of observations between “joined.dataset” and “thin.occ” again.19. We set a limit of 5~km to correct the coordinates, but this value can be modified according to the needs in “success <- ifelse(dist >5000 , TRUE, success)” in step J5. Replace ^arrow5000^° by the new distance. It is important that the new distance value is expressed in meters.20. If the message “Plot occurrences outside layer limits (NA values)” appears when executing step L4, and occurrences outside limits are not obtained, go to step M1 and uncomment the line 762.21. Depending on the number of occurrences of each sample unit, this step can be time consuming. If the case study has many occurrences and many sample units, it is advisable to use a computer with a large RAM memory. If the extraction of climatic data of all occurrences takes a long time, replace method = “bilinear” by method = “simple”.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction and Preparation\nDownload the R script from

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-299","title":"Testing for Allele-specific Expression from Human Brain Samples","text":"Testing for Allele-specific Expression from Human Brain Samples\n\n# Abstract\n\nMany single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies exert their effects on disease risk as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) via allele-specific expression (ASE). While databases for probing eQTLs in tissues from normal individuals exist, one may wish to ascertain eQTLs or ASE in specific tissues or disease-states not characterized in these databases. Here, we present a protocol to assess ASE of two possible target genes (GPNMB and KLHL7) of a known genome-wide association study (GWAS) Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk locus in postmortem human brain tissue from PD and neurologically normal individuals. This was done using a sequence of RNA isolation, cDNA library generation, enrichment for transcripts of interest using customizable cDNA capture probes, paired-end RNA sequencing, and subsequent analysis. This method provides increased sensitivity relative to traditional bulk RNAseq-based and a blueprint that can be extended to the study of other genes, tissues, and disease states.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nBiological materials\n\n1.

Dissect human postmortem brain samples as previously described (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008). In our publication (Diaz-Ortiz et al., 2022), we used neurologically normal controls (NC, n=2 ) and PD (n=4) individuals, and we dissected the caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum.2.  Isolate total RNA from postmortem brain samples using TRIzol and RNeasy Mini columns as previously described (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008).3.  Assess RNA concentration and purity by spectrophotometric measurement of 260/280nm OD ratios using a NanoDrop. Note: We require 260/280 ratios between 1.90 and 2.10 (for ratios outside this range, see General notes and troubleshooting).4.  Assess RNA integrity by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer following the RNA 6000 Nano Kit guide. Note: While RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) of >~7 are desired for most applications, this may not be possible in all cases; our RINs varied between 5.2 and 9.0 (average 6.5). In cases where R I N<6.5 , visual inspection of Bioanalyzer traces is encouraged to ascertain the etiology (see General notes and troubleshooting). Example Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer traces with corresponding RINs are shown in Figure 1.()Figure 1. Example Bioanalyzer traces of RNA samples with various RNA integrity numbers (RINs), specifically RIN=9.0 (A), RIN=5.2 (B), and RIN=3.2 (C). While both B and C have relatively low RIN numbers, the wide second peak from left to right in trace B is consistent with the presence of small RNAs, while the absence of four distinct peaks in trace C is consistent with true RNA degradation.5.  Aliquot RNA isolates and store at -80~^°C until use. Note: We prepared multiple 20mu L aliquots from each brain sample isolated, so that each aliquot can be single used to minimize freeze-thaw effects, which can affect RNA quality and downstream steps.Detailed description of sections B–G are adapted from the Roche SeqCap RNA Enrichment System User Guide.# B. cDNA Library preparationPrepare libraries with the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit per the Roche SeqCap RNA Enrichment System User Guide. An overview of the procedure is provided below:1.  Add spike in controls. a.  Spike-in ERCC controls into 100ng of total RNA following manufacturer’s instructions. b.  Adjust the volume of the spiked RNA sample to a total volume of 10~uL in PCR-grade water.2.  Fragment RNA into 100–200 bp fragments.a. Mix 10~uL of spiked sample with 10~uL of 2× Fragment, Prime, and Elute Buffer on ice by pipetting up and down 10 times.b. Place samples from step B2a in a thermocycler and run for 8min at 94 ^°C .c. Quickly place samples on ice for next step.3.  Perform first-cDNA-strand synthesis.a. Prepare First Strand Master Mix on ice by mixing 11~uL of 1st Strand Synthesis Buffer and 1~uL of KAPA Script per sample. b.  Mix 10~uL of the First Strand Master Mix with 20~uL of fragmented RNA sample on ice by gently pipetting up and down several times. c. Place samples from step B3b in a thermocycler and run for 10min at 25~^°C 15min at 42 ^°C. , and 15 min at 70 ^°C , followed by a 4^°C hold until ready for next step. 4.  Perform second strand synthesis. a. Prepare Second Strand Master Mix on ice by mixing 31~uL of 2nd Strand Marking Buffer with 2~uL of 2nd Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix per sample (for a total volume of 33~uL , which will be 10% in excess of the 30~uL needed for the next step).b.  Mix 30~uL of 1st strand cDNA (samples from step B3c) with 30~uL of the 2nd Strand Master Mix on ice by gently pipetting up and down several times.c.  Place samples from step B4b in a thermocycler and run for 30-60~min at 16 ^°C followed by a 4 ^°C hold until ready for next step.Clean up double-stranded cDNA.a. Mix 60~uL of double-stranded cDNA samples from step B4c with 108~uL of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (prewarmed to room temperature for 30min and vortexed to ensure a homogeneous suspension) by gently pipetting up and down several times.b.  Incubate the tube at room temperature for 15min to allow the cDNA to bind to the beads.c. Place the tube on a dyna-mag2 magnet to capture the beads and incubate until the liquid is clear.d. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant using a P200 pipette.e. Keeping the tube on the magnet, add 200~uL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol.f. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 30~s .g. Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.h. Repeat steps B5e-B5g .i.  Allow the beads to dry at room temperature until all ethanol evaporates. Visually inspect for any remaining drops of ethanol in the tube. The sample is sufficiently dry when no drops are left. Caution: Over-drying the beads (for longer than 3-5 min ) may result in dramatic yield loss.j. Remove the tubes from the magnet.Perform A-tailing.a.

SeqCap RNA ChoiceTM probe pool design1.  Design SeqCap RNA probe pools, using Roche Sequencing Solutions Custom Design (Roche, WI). We designed probes of approximately 60 bp in length with no more than 20 close matches in the genome, as determined by the Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm (SSAHA). The goal was to provide sufficient coverage of transcripts of interest (GPNMB, KLHL7) while minimizing potential offtarget effects. A close match is defined as any genomic sequence that differs from one of the probe sequences by five or fewer single-base insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Select exonic probes that cover the transcript(s) of interest (here, GPNMB and KLHL7). While single mismatches within a 60 bp probe are typically not thought to affect hybridization dynamics, as a conservative measure to minimize SNP-mediated capture bias, we ensured that probes do not overlap any SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r^2> 0.2) with the sentinel SNP (here, rs199347).# E.

Combine equimolar amounts of cDNA libraries (already barcoded) from each brain sample for a total mass of 1~ug .d.  In a 1.5mL tube, combine 5uL of human COT DNA (control DNA included in SeqCap accessory kit v2), 1~ug of pooled cDNA from previous step, and 2,000 pmol of HE oligo pool.e.  Dry the samples from section E step 1d in a vacuum concentrator or at high heat at 60~^°C and then resuspend in 7.5~uL of 2× Hybridization buffer with 3~uL of hybridization component A by vortexing and then spinning down for 10s at maximum speed.f.

To more thoroughly understand how blood components interact with the artificial surfaces of ECLS circuit components, assessment of clot deposition on these surfaces following clinical use is urgently needed. Scanning electron microscopy  (SEM),  which  produces  high-resolution  images  at  nanoscale  level,  allows  visualization  and characterization of thrombotic deposits on ECLS circuitry. However, methodologies to increase the quantifiability of SEM analysis of ECLS circuit components have yet to be applied clinically. To address these issues, we developed a protocol to quantify clot deposition on ECLS membrane oxygenator gas transfer fiber sheets through digital and SEM imaging techniques. In this study, ECLS membrane oxygenator fiber sheets were obtained, fixed, and imaged after use. Following a standardized process, the percentage of clot deposition on both digital images and SEM images was quantified using ImageJ through blind reviews. The interrater reliability of quantitative analysis among reviewers was evaluated. Although this protocol focused on the analysis of ECLS membrane oxygenators, it is also adaptable to other components of the ECLS circuits such as catheters and tubing.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Reagents\n\n1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-334","title":"Functional Assay for Measuring Bacterial Degradation of Gemcitabine Chemotherapy","text":"Functional Assay for Measuring Bacterial Degradation of Gemcitabine Chemotherapy\n\n# Abstract\n\nDrug biotransformation by the host microbiome can impact the therapeutic success of treatment. In the context of cancer, drug degradation can take place within the microenvironment of the targeted tumor by intratumor bacteria. In pancreatic cancer, increased chemo-resistance against the frontline chemotherapy gemcitabine is thought to arise from drug degradation by the tumor microbiome. This bacterial–drug interaction highlights the need for developing rapid assays for monitoring bacterial gemcitabine breakdown. While chemical approaches such as highperformance liquid chromatography are suitable for this task, they require specialized equipment and expertise and are limited in throughput. Functional cell-based assays represent an alternate approach for performing this task. We developed a functional assay to monitor the rate of bacterial gemcitabine breakdown using a highly sensitive bacterial reporter strain. Our method relies on standard laboratory equipment and can be implemented at high throughput to monitor drug breakdown by hundreds of strains simultaneously. This functional assay can be readily adapted to monitor degradation of other drugs.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Biological materials\n\n1.

Preparing the conditioned supernatantFigure 1A shows the overview of the procedure. For biological replicates, we recommend repeating the entire section A on different days.()Figure 1. Schematic representation of the protocol for determining gemcitabine degradation rate. A. Protocol for preparing the conditioned supernatants. Bacterial cultures, normalized to an identical optical density, are incubated with gemcitabine in PBS for defined periods of time. Samples are removed from the incubated cultures and filtered to yield conditioned supernatants. The assay can be paused after the filtering stage and supernatants can be frozen for later use. B. Protocol for the functional assay. The reporter strain ( E. . coli Δcdd) is grown overnight and aliquots of the conditioned supernatant are then added to the growth culture. Growth of the reporter strain is monitored in a microplate optical density (OD) reader. Changes in growth curves are used to infer the gemcitabine concentration in the conditioned supernatant of different strains (red: fast degrader; blue: slow degrader) compared to a reference strain (green). Parts of the figure were created with BioRender.com.1.  Inoculate your test bacterial strains into 1~mL of LB in a 96-deep-well plate and grow overnight at 37 ^°C. , 200rpm shaker. Also inoculate the reference strain for comparison. Critical: Inoculate multiple replicates of reference strain (at least six technical replicates)2.  On the next day, pellet the cells by centrifuging the plate at 5,000×~g for 10 min using a centrifuge with multi-well plate holders.3. Discard the supernatant without disrupting the pellet and resuspend the cells in 1~mL of PBS.4. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 10min using a centrifuge with multi-well plate holders.5. Repeat steps A3–A4 two additional times.6.  Let the cells incubate in 1~mL of PBS for 1 h and then measure the OD ( (600nm) after 1:4 dilution in PBS at a final volume of 200~uL (e.g., 50uL of cell suspension, 150~uL of PBS).7. Dilute the cultures to an OD of 0.5 in a 96-deep-well plate at a final volume of 1.1mL of PBS.8. Sample 200uL from the diluted cultures and measure optical density to validate if the dilution was accurate. Critical: Accuracy of dilution is important since any deviation from the intended cell number will influence the drug breakdown speed and will be incorrectly interpreted as a change in drug breakdown rate.9. Add gemcitabine at a final concentration of 200~uM : prepare 21×(4.2 mM) gemcitabine and pipette 45 uL into 900~uL of bacterial suspension. Critical: Make sure your gemcitabine stocks are kept sterile and avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Caution: Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment when working with gemcitabine and follow institutional health and safety regulations for managing gemcitabine waste. Gemcitabine is a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent.10. Incubate the plate on a tabletop microplate shaker at 37 ^°C and 900rpm .11. At designated timepoints (15 and 45min ), transfer 400uL of liquid culture into a 96-well plate filter placed onto a 96-deep-well plate and centrifuge immediately at 5,000×g for 5 min using a centrifuge with multiwell plate holders. Critical: A 15~min timepoint is suitable for identifying fast degraders, and a 45~min timepoint is suitable for identifying the slow degraders. These incubation periods can be adjusted for work with other bacterial species that degrade gemcitabine at considerably different rates than E_ . coli.12. Safe stopping point: if you are not proceeding immediately to section B, cover the supernatant with sterile plastic foil and freeze at -20~^°C .# B.  Performing the functional assay: testing the conditioned supernatantsFigure 1B shows the overview of the procedure. We recommend performing section B in triplicates using threeindependent biological replicates that are collected by performing section A on three different days.1.  Inoculate a single colony of reporter mutant Δcdd into 3mL of M9 media with 50~ug/mL kanamycin and grow overnight at 37 ^°C and 200rpm in a shaker.2.  On the next day, measure the OD of the culture (after 1:20 dilution in M9) and dilute the culture to OD 1 in 1~mL of M9.3.  Further dilute the culture 1:500 in M9 (final volume of 25mL ) and pipette 190~uL into each well of a 96- well microplate.4.  Add 10~uL of conditioned buffer from section A into each well. This step should be performed quickly, so all individual cultures start the exposure at the same time point. Caution: If the conditioned supernatants to be tested are frozen, thaw them at room temperature in advance. Optional: This step can be performed using a 96-channel handheld electric pipette to make sure all wells receive the conditioned supernatant simultaneously.5.  Monitor the growth of the culture in the microplate using a suitable microplate optical density reader. Define a repeating measurement cycle that includes incubation at 37 ^°C and double orbital shaking at 360 rpm with reading the OD every 10 min over 8 h (plate lid on). Make sure to measure M9 alone for a blank optical density value.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparing the Conditioned Supernatant\n## Inoculation and Growth\nInoculate test bacterial strains into 1 mL of LB in a 96-deep-well plate and grow overnight at 37°C, 200 rpm shaker.\nInoculate the reference strain for comparison, with at least six technical replicates.\n## Cell Pellet and Resuspension\nPellet the cells by centrifuging the plate at 5,000×g for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant without disrupting the pellet and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS.\nRepeat steps of pelleting and resuspending two additional times.\n## Incubation and OD Measurement\nLet the cells incubate in 1 mL of PBS for 1 h.\nMeasure the OD (600 nm) after 1:4 dilution in PBS at a final volume of 200 µL.\n## Dilution and Validation\nDilute the cultures to an OD of 0.5 in a 96-deep-well plate at a final volume of 1.1 mL of PBS.\nSample 200 µL from the diluted cultures and measure optical density to validate the dilution accuracy.\n## Gemcitabine Addition and Incubation\nAdd gemcitabine at a final concentration of 200 µM.\nIncubate the plate on a tabletop microplate shaker at 37°C and 900 rpm.\n## Sampling and Filtration\nAt designated timepoints (15 and 45 min), transfer 400 µL of liquid culture into a 96-well plate filter.\nCentrifuge immediately at 5,000×g for 5 min.\n## Performing the Functional Assay\n## Reporter Strain Preparation\nInoculate a single colony of reporter mutant Δcdd into 3 mL of M9 media with 50 µg/mL kanamycin.\nGrow overnight at 37°C and 200 rpm in a shaker.\n## Culture Dilution and Conditioning\nMeasure the OD of the culture and dilute to OD 1 in 1 mL of M9.\nFurther dilute the culture 1:500 in M9 (final volume of 25 mL).\n## Conditioned Supernatant Addition and Growth Monitoring\nPipette 190 µL of the diluted culture into each well of a 96-well microplate.\nAdd 10 µL of conditioned buffer from section A into each well.\nMonitor the growth of the culture using a microplate optical density reader.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Microbiology & Virology"}}

However, sub genome assignments in allopolyploids can be technically challenging. The present study used a likelihood-based tool, POInT (the Polyploid Orthology Inference Tool) to model the resolution of the ancient wholegenome triplication events in Brassiceae.

If no tree file is given, POInT will try to search all possible topologies. However, for larger datasets with five or six genomes, this step will be intractable. Here, the optimal topology for the four species in the case study is provided.# C. Testing different WGT modelsThe analyses showcased here were performed on the Linux system. Twenty-four cores were requested when submitting the job to the high-performance computing cluster.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-355","title":"LiverQuant: An Improved Method for Quantitative Analysis of Liver Pathology","text":"LiverQuant: An Improved Method for Quantitative Analysis of Liver Pathology\n\n# Abstract\n\nCurrent means to quantify cells, gene expression, and fibrosis of liver histological slides are not standardized in the research community and typically rely upon data acquired from a selection of random regions identified in each slide. As such, analyses are subject to selection bias as well as limited subsets of available data elements throughout the slide. A whole-slide analysis of cells and fibrosis would provide for a more accurate and complete quantitative analysis, along with minimization of intra- and inter-experimental variables. Herein, we present LiverQuant, a method for quantifying whole-slide scans of digitized histologic images to render a more comprehensive analysis of presented data elements. After loading images and preparing the project in the QuPath program, researchers are provided with one to two scripts per analysis that generate an average intensity threshold for their staining, automated tissue annotation, and downstream detection of their anticipated cellular matrices. When compared with two standard methodologies for histological quantification, LiverQuant had two significant advantages: increased speed and a 50-fold greater tissue area coverage. Using publicly available open-source code (GitHub), LiverQuant improves the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results while reducing the time scientists require to perform bulk analysis of liver histology. This analytical process is readily adaptable by most laboratories, requires minimal optimization, and its principles and code can be optimized for use in other organs.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Immunohistochemistry and scanningThe method utilized for isolation, preparation, and scanning of liver sections will not be covered within this protocol. All mouse liver sections that were used for this method were fixed in a standard approach with paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m thickness, and stained using the appropriate immunohistochemical techniques. Within this study, we will be using mouse sections that were stained using primary antibodies against cytokeratin 19 (cholangiocytes) with a -smooth muscle actin as an endothelial counterstain, F4/80 (macrophages), and picosirius red (collagen) with a Fast Green counterstain. For additional details see Hellen et al. (2023). All sections were imported into QuPath in NDPI file format taken using a Vectra Polaris scanner at 40× magnification. QuPath supports a bank of file extensions for importing, spanning greater than 150 different file formats. Prior to importing files for downstream analysis using QuPath, it is suggested to transfer the desired files onto the computer that will be used for quantification. This will aid in speed and processing time, as internal file access speed is typically the most rate-limiting factor in any of these analyses. It is additionally recommended that an entire cross-section (whole slide) is scanned into QuPath, rather than individual smaller ROIs.# B.  Downloading GitHub files (https://github.com/DominickHellen/LiverQuant)1.  Navigate to the GitHub repository link.2.  Download the ZIP file of contents by clicking <> Code ongrightarrow Download ZIP (Figure 1A).()Figure 1. Retrieving LiverQuant files from GitHub. (A) All files necessary for the protocol are available for download online. The red arrow indicates exactly where to download the necessary files. (B)All .GROOVY and .JSON files should be available for use after download and unzipping.3.  Unpack ZIP files by right-clicking arrowOpen . All files for LiverQuant Bio-Protocol should be within the code folder (Figure 1B).# C. Preparing the projectPreparing a project in QuPath starts with creating a folder in a file manager of choice (e.g., Mac Finder, Windows File Explorer). To have all files of interest in the right place, it is better to create a folder on the computer and place all files within that folder.1. Within the designated folder that contains all the files of interest, create another folder. This will be the hub that QuPath will use for all related paths and metadata (Figure 2A). Note: Keep this folder empty and entitle it New Folder.()Figure 2. Preparing LiverQuant. (A) Representative image of the New Folder where the images and scripts needed for analysis will be stored. (B) Example of images ready to be imported into QuPath. (C) Within New Folder, generate the scripts folder, where (D) all downloaded .GROOVY scripts should be placed.  (E)  Within  the  classifiers  folder,  generate  pixel_classifiers  folder,  and  (F)  place  all downloaded .JSON files.2.  Download the most recent edition of QuPath and start the program. Note: These scripts have been designed and tested using QuPath v0.4.3.3. Create a project within QuPath using the Create Project button.4.  Navigate to the empty New Folder that has been created in step 1 and click Select folder.5.  The Add images button within QuPath should now be accessible. Click Add images and proceed to add the desired histological image files.6.  After selecting chosen images, click Open.7. Verify that all of the images are added to the Import Images to project pop-up and click Import (Figure 2B). a.  Leave the Image provider as Default (let QuPath decide). b.  Leave the image type blank. Note: Image type will vary depending on the analysis (Brightfield H-DAB—Macrophages, Brightfield Other—Fibrosis, or Fluorescence—Cholangiocytes) and is automatically  selected within the detection scripts. c.  Do not choose to rotate the image, as it can occasionally slow down QuPath’s ability to read the file. d.  Leave Auto-generate pyramids checked. Note: Most whole-slide scanned images are pyramidal, which carries data at multiple resolutions and can be sub-sampled depending on the analysis. e.  The Import objects option can remain unchecked for a new project.8.  Finally, navigate back to the New Folder in the file manager and add a folder entitled scripts (Figure 2C).9.  Place Fibrosis detection script, Macrophage detection script, Cholangiocyte detection script, Fibrosis intensity script, and Macrophage intensity script (.GROOVY files), taken from the GitHub link, into the scripts folder (Figure 2D). Note: These scripts should show up in the toolbar under Automate > Project scripts…10. Within New Folder, open classifiers, and create a new folder entitled pixel_classifiers (Figure 2E).11. Add the Fibrosis and Macrophage .JSON files into the pixel_classifiers folder (Figure 2F).# D. QuPath immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysisWhole-slide analysis of immune cell types, fibrosis, and biliary tract composition (cholangiocytes) can provide researchers with an efficient understanding of liver health. This protocol will outline the automated quantification of macrophages, fibrosis, and cholangiocytes within whole-slide sections of liver tissue, respectively. This section will be divided by the respective arc of liver histology chosen for analysis. Each protocol relies heavily upon customizable scripts written in the Groovy language within QuPath. The scripts are open-source and contain detailed annotations of each function and command used for their respective analysis. It is highly recommended to analyze the scripts prior to performing analyses in order to avoid potential pitfalls, optimize, and understand possible errors.# E. Automated quantification of macrophages within QuPathNote: For this type of analysis, the 3,3^. -Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic dye was used to detect the secondary antibody attached to the primary anti-F4/80 antibody.1.  Open one image by double-clicking the image icon.2.  Set the image type to Brightfield H-DAB (Figure 3A).3. (Automatic Thresholding) Annotate three ROIs (using the brush tool) within the image that are good samples of how intense the macrophage stain is (Figure 3B). Tip: The larger the ROIs, the more accurate the downstream analysis will be. Note: Self-thresholding is outlined in section H.4.  When finished annotating, run the macrophage intensity analysis by going to Automate ongrightarrow Project scripts… and clicking on Macrophage intensity script. For this script to run effectively, researchers need to type in their directory pathname on lines 24 and 29. Note: This protocol segment provides the Macrophage detection script with an average intensity threshold for quantification specific to the selected histological samples.5. Once the Macrophage intensity script is completed, open the Macrophage detection script in Automate ongrightarrow Project scripts… ongrightarrow Macrophage detection script.6.  Within the Macrophage detection script, right-click and click Run… > Run for project.The script will automate whole tissue annotation (Figure 3C) and quantify macrophages for each image (Figure 3D).i. The running time for each image is approximately 3 min.ii. Self-annotation for each image is covered in section I.()Figure 3. Macrophage detection using LiverQuant.

D, scale bars: 50um .7.  If satisfied with the analysis, proceed to section J to export measurements.# G. Automated detection of cholangiocytes within QuPathNote: The script that was written for cholangiocyte detection utilizes the positive cell detection plugin found within QuPath. It may be useful to further optimize the Positive cell detection plugin to a ROI within the slide and apply its values to the .GROOVY script for batch analysis. The most important parameter to adjust, as mentioned in the .GROOVY script is threshold.1.  Open one image by double-clicking the image icon.2. Set the image type to Fluorescence (Figure 5A).()Figure 5. Cholangiocyte detection using LiverQuant.

The script will automate whole tissue annotation (Figure 5B) and quantify cholangiocytes for each image (Figure 5C). Notes: i. The running time for one image is approximately 5 min. ii. Self-annotation is outlined in section I.5.  Proceed to section J for exporting measurements if satisfied with the analysis.# H. Self-thresholding for fibrosis and macrophages detection within QuPath1. Open one image by double-clicking the image icon.2.  Set the image type to Brightfield (H-DAB) (Figure 3A) for macrophages or Brightfield (other) (Figure 4A) for fibrosis.3.  Annotate an area of interest (using the brush tool).4.  When finished annotating, zoom in on any area of interest. This area will be used as a probe to determine the appropriate filters to quantify the macrophages or fibrosis within the scanned image.5. Open the Pixel classification tool within the Classify menu bar and select Pixel classification > Create thresholder.6. Within the Create thresholder pop-up, adjust the parameters to accurately quantify macrophages (Figure 6A) or Fibrosis (Figure 6B). Note: To visualize the positive and negative selections, make sure the Show pixel classification button has been clicked (the button with the letter C on it).()Figure 6. Self-thresholding for downstream LiverQuant analysis. (A) Representative photo of Create thresholder tool in QuPath for macrophage, and (B) fibrosis detection, respectively. A, scale bars: 50um . B, scale bars: 100um .a.  For macrophage detection: Set Above threshold to Positive and Below threshold to Negative. b.  For fibrosis detection: Set Above threshold to Negative and Below threshold to Positive. c.  Set Channel to Dab for macrophages and Residual for fibrosis. d.  Set Resolution to High. Note: The higher the resolution, the slower QuPath will function in the analysis of the section of interest. e.  Smoothing Sigma can remain at 0 and can be changed to 1 if background staining is strong to help eliminate possible false positive detections. f. Starting threshold should be 0.2 for macrophages and 0.0 for fibrosis and optimized from there to isolate true-positive dab or picosirius staining, respectively. Macrophages will show up as red and the background as blue (Figure 6A). Fibrotic septa will show up as red and the background as blue (Figure 6B). g. Set Region to Any annotations. h.  Enter the Classifier name as LiverQuantM to utilize the Macrophage detection script and LiverQuantF to utilize the Fibrosis detection script. 7.  After optimizing the threshold for LiverQuantM or LiverQuantF, proceed to step E6 or F6 for batch detection of macrophages or fibrosis, respectively.# I.  Annotating slides by hand within QuPathNote: Self-annotation must be followed by the specific steps outlined below.1.  Annotate the desired areas within each image that require quantification using QuPath’s brush tool (Figure 7A). Tip: Avoid liver borders, and longitudinally cut large central veins or portal triads, as some will have false-positive staining. Tip: To subtract annotation, hold Alt for Windows or Command for Mac while annotating.# A()# B1516//This shouid be deleted if you want to annotate by hand17//clearSelected0bjects();18.19 //This should be deleted if you want to annotate byhand20 //Increase or decrease the 'threshold number below to imy21//runPlugin(lgupath.imagej.detect.tissue.SimpleTissueDetec22Figure 7.

The exact number of chromosomes in this genus is unknown since counting methods established for higher plants cannot be applied to green algae. The massive presence of pectins and arabinogalactan proteins in the cell wall interferes with the uptake of staining solutions; moreover, cell divisions in green algae are not restricted to meristems as in higher plants, which is another limiting factor. Cell divisions occur randomly in the thallus, due to the intercalary growth of algal filaments. Therefore, we increased the number of cell divisions via synchronization by changing the light cycle (10:14 h light/dark). The number of observed mitotic stages peaked at the beginning of the dark cycle. This protocol describes two methods for the visualization of chromosomes in the filamentous green alga Zygnema. Existing protocols were modified, leading to improved acetocarmine and haematoxylin staining methods as investigated by light microscopy. A freeze-shattering approach with liquid nitrogen was applied to increase the accessibility of the haematoxylin dye. These modified protocols allowed reliable chromosome counting in the genus Zygnema.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Biological material\n\n1.

TA systems have been classified into eight types (I–VIII) based on the nature and mechanism of action of the antitoxin. Type III TA systems consist of a noncoding RNA antitoxin and a protein toxin, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) TA complex that plays crucial roles in phage defence in bacteria. Type III TA systems are present in the human gut microbiome and several pathogenic bacteria and, therefore, could be exploited for a novel antibacterial strategy. Due to the inherent toxicity of the toxin for E. . coli, it is challenging to overexpress and purify free toxins from E_ . coli expression systems. Therefore, protein toxin is typically co-expressed and co-purified with antitoxin RNA as an RNP complex from E . coli for structural and biophysical studies. Here, we have optimized the co-expression and purification method for ToxIN type III TA complexes from E. . coli that results in the purification of TA RNP complex and, often, free antitoxin RNA and free active toxin in quantities required for the biophysical and structural studies. This protocol can also be adapted to purify isotopically labelled (e.g., uniformly ^15N- or ^13C_^- labelled) free toxin proteins, free antitoxin RNAs, and TA RNPs, which can be studied using multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Biological materials\n\n1.

Perform the DNA synthesis and cloning of the identified type III TA operon into a high copy number E_ . coli plasmid vector through a gene synthesis service provider. Sub-clone the antitoxin repeats and its natural promoter into pRSFDuet-1 vector using standard cloning protocols described below (Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 1).2. Design forward and reverse primers to amplify the antitoxin region along with the natural promoter and terminator, with addition of restriction enzyme sites NcoI and XhoI at the 5^ and 3^ ends of the insert. PCR amplify the insert from the plasmid containing type III TA operon, using Phusion DNA polymerase (a PCR reaction setup is indicated in Recipe 1 and Table 1).3.  Purify the PCR-amplified insert using the PCR purification kit following the manufacturer’s protocol and elute DNA using nuclease-free water.4. Digest 1-2~ug of the PCR purified insert using the restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI by incubating at 37 ^°C for 2h by setting up a reaction as described in Recipe 2.5.  Digest 5~ug of the pRSFDuet-1 vector using the same restriction enzymes in a 50~uL reaction. After digesting the vector, incubate the reaction mixture at 80~^°C for 20 min to heat-inactivate the restriction enzymes. Treat the mixture with 0.3~uL of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) at 37~^°C for 1~h~ to prevent vector self-ligation.6.  Purify the digested insert and vector using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Visualize the digested insert and vector bands from the ethidium bromide–stained gel by UV irradiation at 254nm . Excise the gel bands containing the vector and insert and isolate the respective DNA fragments using a gel extraction kit following manufacturer’s protocol; elute DNAs using nuclease-free water.7.  Use 100~ng of each digested vector and insert DNAs .1:7 ratio) to set up a 20~uL ligation reaction as described in Recipe 3. Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature for 1~h~ followed by incubation at 4^°C for 5-12h .8.  Transform 10~uL of the ligation reaction mixture in E. . coli DH50 competent cells and plate them in LB agar plate containing kanamycin (0.05~mg/mL) ) antibiotic. A control ligation reaction and transformation could be performed without the insert DNA in the reaction mixture. The control reaction should result in significantly fewer (~10-fold) colonies than the ligation with the insert.9. Isolate plasmid DNA from the colonies obtained upon transformation using a plasmid isolation kit and confirm the positive clones by sequencing.Table 1. Thermocycling conditions for the PCR reaction()# B.  Molecular cloning of type III toxin protein1.  Design forward and reverse primers to clone the type III toxin into an E . coli expression vector under an inducible promoter with a hexahistidine tag. The vector must be compatible for co-transformation with the pRSFDuet-1 vector with a different antibiotic resistance and a different origin of replication (e.g., pCold II, pRSFDuet-1, pET21a(+) , etc.) In our study, we cloned the type III toxin into a pCold II vector under a cold-shock inducible promoter with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag between the restriction enzyme sites NdeI and XbaI.2. Obtain the ligated plasmid containing toxin insert in the vector of interest by following cloning steps A2– A7 of antitoxin cloning using the toxin insert and appropriate vector DNA.3.  Co-transform 10~uL of the ligation mixture along with 100ng of the antitoxin DNA containing plasmid in E. coli DH5alpha competent cells and plate on an LB agar plate containing both kanamycin ( 0.05:mg/mL and ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) antibiotics.4.  Isolate the plasmid DNA mixture (toxin and antitoxin) from the colonies obtained and confirm the positive toxin clones by sequencing using primers specific to the toxin cloning site. The obtained plasmid DNA mixture will be used further to transform E . coli cells to express and purify the type III TA complex. In our study, the plasmid DNA mixture contains antitoxin and toxin cloned in vectors, as shown in Supplementary Table 1.()Figure 1.

(C) No colonies were obtained upon transformation of plasmids containing only toxin. (D) Positive colonies were obtained upon co-transforming plasmids containing toxin and antitoxin in different compatible vectors.# C. Transformation and inoculation1.  Place a vial of E_ . coli BL21 DE3 competent cells from -80~^°C stock on ice to thaw for 15min .2.  Add 100ng of the plasmid mixture (toxin and antitoxin) and incubate on ice for 20min .3.  Provide heat shock by placing the vial in a dry bath at 42 ^°C for 45~s~ and immediately transfer the vial on ice and incubate for 5:min .4.  Add 250uL of LB medium to the vial in a laminar airflow cabinet and incubate for 1 h in a shaker incubator maintained at 37 ^°C at 180rpm .5. Spread plate by using 150~uL of this culture on an agar plate containing double antibiotic corresponding to the plasmid combination chosen; here, we used ampicillin (0.1mg/mL) and kanamycin (0.05mg/mL) and incubate for 12-14h to obtain the transformed colonies. We did not observe bacterial colonies posttransformation of only toxin plasmid (Figure 1C). However, the co-transformation of toxin and antitoxin plasmids resulted in bacterial colonies selected using dual antibiotics (Figure 1D).6. Inoculate 100~mL of LB medium with both antibiotics with a single colony from the transformed plate. Incubate overnight at 37 ^°C at 180rpm in a shaker incubator.7. Depending on the plasmid in which the toxin and antitoxin are cloned (Table 1), one of the following steps can be followed: a.  Toxin cloned in pCold II: inoculate 10mL of the overnight primary culture (in LB media) into a larger secondary culture (1 L of LB media) and incubate until OD_600 reaches 0.8–1.0 . Incubate the culture at 15~^°C without shaking for 30 min and induce by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1~mM . Incubate at 180rpm for 24~h at 15^°C for complex expression. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,800× g for 15min . b. Toxin cloned in operatornamepET-21a(+) : inoculate 10mL of the overnight primary culture (in LB media) into a larger secondary culture ( ^scriptsize1L of LB media) and incubate until an OD_6000.6–0.8 . Induce by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM . Incubate the culture at 180rpm for 4-5h at 37^°C for complex expression. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,800× g for 15min . Stop point: The cell pellet can be stored at -20~^°C for up to a month before processing.# D. Cell lysis and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography1.  Resuspend the cells in lysis buffer (see Recipes) and add a tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail.2. Lyse the cells by sonication with a pulse of 3 s on and 6 s off and an amplitude of 32% .3. Centrifuge the lysed cells at ^18,328× g for 45min at 4^°C in the Oakridge centrifuge tubes.4. Equilibrate Ni^2+ -NTA column connected to a peristaltic pump with lysis buffer. Filter the supernatant using a 0.45~um syringe filter and load it onto the column at a 1.5~mL/min flow rate. After loading, wash the column with 50mL of wash buffer (see Recipes). Elute the complex using elution buffer.5. Collect three fractions: E1, the first 2mL ; E2, the next 15mL ; and E3, the final 5mL . Store at 4~^°C .6. Wash the column with the final wash buffer to remove any bound protein to the column. Pass 25~mL of Milli-Q water and store the Ni^2+ -NTA column in 20% ethanol.7. PAGE analysis of toxin and antitoxin: to analyse the flowthrough, wash, and elution fractions on 12% SDS-PAGE for the presence of toxin protein and on 15% Urea-PAGE for the presence of RNA antitoxin. Visualize the protein in SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie brilliant blue staining solution followed by destaining using destaining solution (see Recipes). The RNA can be visualized by staining the urea-PAGE gels with 0.25% toluidine blue solution followed by destaining using water.# E.  Dialysis1.  Collect all the elution fractions that contain the TA components for dialysis (usually, E2 has the TA components).2. Dialysis: wash an appropriate length (which can hold the elution fraction volume containing the TA component) of the ^6M dialysis bag with a cutoff of 3.5kDa with MilliQ H_2O and equilibrate with dialysis buffer.3.  Carefully add the elution fractions into the bag and dialyse at 4 ^°C for 4-5 h .4.  Change the dialysis buffer and continue to dialyse for 12-14h .# F.  Ion-exchange chromatography1.  Equilibrate the anion-exchange column with 25mL of ion-exchange buffer A.2.  Filter the dialysed complex using a 0.45~um syringe filter and load it onto the anion-exchange column at a 1 mL/min flow rate connected to ÄKTA prime plus FPLC system. After loading, wash the column with 20mL of ion-exchange buffer A.3.  Elute the complex by increasing the gradient of NaCl from 50 to 1,000mM (using buffer A and buffer B), over a volume of 100mL . This should yield separate fractions of ToxN protein (0%-20% buffer B), TA RNP complex ( 45%-55% buffer B), and antitoxin ToxI RNA repeat 55%-75% buffer B) (Figure 2A), which can be confirmed by PAGE analysis of protein and RNA components.()Figure 2. Expression and purification of type III toxin–antitoxin (TA) components from ToxIN_Ec -C1. (A) Anion-exchange chromatography profile of ToxIN_Ec -C1 complex shows the purification of individual toxin, antitoxin, and complex components of ToxINEc-C1. (B–D) Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles of ToxI_Ec -C1 RNA (B), ToxN_Ec-C1 protein (C), and ToxIN_Ec -C1 complex (D). The SEC profiles suggest the presence of the purified components in a single oligomeric state. (E) SDS-PAGE analysis of SEC-purified ToxIN_Ec-C1 complex. Gel is stained using Coomassie stain for protein and shows the presence of ToxN_Ec.C1 protein. (F) Urea-PAGE analysis of SEC-purified ToxIN_Ec -C1 complex. Gel stained using toluidine blue dye for RNA shows the presence of ToxIEc-C1 RNA repeat.# G. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)1.  After ion-exchange chromatography, collect the fractions containing toxin, antitoxin, and complex separately.2.  Pool each set of fractions separately and concentrate using Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (3.5kDa) to a final volume of 4~mL .3.  Filter the concentrated samples using a 0.45~um syringe filter and inject into Sephacryl S-200 or Superdex S200 columns, pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer. Figure 2B–2D show the SEC elution profiles of antitoxin RNA (Figure 2B), TA RNP complex (Figure 2C), and toxin protein (Figure 2D).4. Analyse the fractions on SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE. Figure 2E and 2F show the SDS-PAGE and ureaPAGE analysis of SEC-purified ToxIN_Ec -C1 complex for the presence of toxin protein and antitoxin RNA, respectively.The fractions can be pooled together and concentrated appropriately depending on the experiment that needs to be performed, such as NMR spectroscopy, crystallization, or ITC. Using this protocol, we could also successfully purify two other ToxIN complexes and their components (from cluster 4 and 5 of E. . coli) (Manikandan et al., 2022) (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2).# General notes and troubleshooting1.  The complete type III TA operon should contain i) the predicted natural promoter (including the -35 and -10 box regions), ii) the antitoxin RNA repeats, iii) the predicted transcription terminator, and iv) the toxin protein coding region (codon optimized for E_ . coli expression). In our study, the type III TA operon from E. coli ToxIN Cluster 1 ToxIN_Ec-C1 ) including natural promoter was synthesized and cloned into a pUC57 vector by GenScript (USA).2.  It is advisable to run the fractions obtained after every step of purification Ni^2+-N T A affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography) on the SDS-PAGE and Urea-PAGE to visualize the protein and RNA, respectively. This also ensures the visualization of impurities in the fractions eluted and whether another round of purification is required before proceeding to the biophysical experiments.3.  All the buffers used in the protocol were filtered with 0.22 um sterile filters and used within one week of preparation.4.  For measuring the concentration of protein, any of the standard methods could be employed, such as absorbance at 280nm or Bradford’s assay.5.  Absorbance at 260nm was used for measuring the concentration of RNA.6.  In cases where it was difficult to measure the protein concentration accurately, 1:1 ratio of the RNA:protein was assumed to obtain an approximate concentration of the RNP TA complex.7. Since the protocol involves the purification of RNA and RNA–protein complexes, it is important to be careful while handling the samples and to keep the columns away from RNases to obtain a good yield.8.  The toxin and antitoxin of ToxIN systems used in our study were cloned in separate compatible vectors. It is also possible to clone them in the same vector under different promoters to express and purify the components.9.  The toxin protein and TA complex fractions can be stored at 4^°C (up to a week) and the antitoxin RNA fractions can be stored at -20~^°C (up to a month) or -80^°C (for more than a month).\n\n#

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-419","title":"Iterative Indirect Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i) on Adherent Cells and Tissue Sections","text":"Iterative Indirect Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i) on Adherent Cells and Tissue Sections\n\n# Abstract\n\nHighly multiplexed protein measurements from multiple spatial scales using fluorescence microscopy recently emerged as a powerful way to investigate tumor microenvironments in biomedicine and the multivariate nature of complex systems’ interactions. A range of methods for this exist, which either rely on directly labeling the primary antibody with oligonucleotides/rare metals or employing methods to remove fluorescence for cyclic acquisition. Here, we describe a protocol that uses off-the-shelf primary and secondary antibodies without further need for modification and only commonly available chemical reagents. The method harnesses the observation that antibodies can crosslink to bound epitopes during light exposure, thus preventing elution. By utilizing a simple oxygen radical scavenging buffer during imaging and by blocking free sulfhydryl groups before antibody incubation, the presented method can employ comparably mild conditions to remove bound antibodies from epitopes, which preserves sample integrity. Thus, with the stated minor modifications, it allows for a standard immunofluorescence imaging protocol in cyclic fashion, currently permitting staining of up to 80 unique epitopes.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# For both tissue culture cells and FFPE tissue sections\n\n1.

Every volume and step are indicated on a per well basis. However, the protocol works for any container and adherent cell type if the volumes are adjusted accordingly. Numbers in bold indicate the final dilution.For every step described in section C, the sample needs to be protected from light at all times. This is essential for the protocol to work. The procedure works best when using automated liquid handling, which necessitates building light-protecting containers around the machines. If manual handling is performed, keep the light as dim as possible, and preferentially at wavelengths above 600nm .When performing 4i on tissue culture cells, perform A and then repeat C and D to achieve the desired level of multiplexing. In the last 4i cycle, perform C, E, and D. 4i works well with poorly adherent cell lines, which require a coated surface (e.g., poly-lysine). However, liquid handling should be performed very cautiously.When performing 4i on tissue sections, perform B and then repeat C and D to achieve the desired level of multiplexing.# A. Sample preparation, tissue culture cells1.  Prepare the fixation solution (FS, see Recipes) and the permeabilization solution (PS, see Recipes).2. Perform experiment as desired.3. Add 100~uL of FS. 1:24. Incubate at RT for 20min .5. Wash three times with 100~uL of PBS.6. Aspirate to a volume of 50uL .7. Add 50uL of PS. 1:28. Incubate at RT for 10min .9. Wash three times with 100~uL of PBS.10. Aspirate to a volume of 100~uL .11. Store the plate at 4^°C until proceeding to Section C.# B. Sample preparation, FFPE (tissue sections)1.  Place the microtiter plate superstructure over the glass bottom. Mark the position of the microtiter plate well on the glass bottom by running the water-resistant, ethanol-soluble pen along the inside of each well while the pen is also touching the glass bottom. Each well will contain one tissue section.2. Remove the plate superstructure and turn the glass bottom over.3. Using a PAP pen, encircle all well markings with one single line. This line will serve as a tension barrier in the next step.4. Add 7.5mL of Poly-L-Lysine inside the PAP pen line and ensure that the whole surface within the surface tension barrier is covered by the solution.5.  Incubate in a chemical hood at RT for 1h .6.  Remove the Poly-L-Lysine solution from the glass bottom by aspiration or by gently tipping the glass bottom on its side.7.  Use a water microtome cutter to generate sections 2-6~um thick of the precooled paraffin block and let them float in the water bath of the microtome. A detailed protocol for cutting the paraffin sections can be found in Wang and Hasnain (2017).8.  Insert the glass bottom at a 45^° angle into the water bath, with the coated side facing the samples.9.  Using the well markings, place the edge of the paraffin on the slanted plate and pull the plate out at a 45^° angle.10. Dry the glass bottom slide in a plate at 37 ^°C for 2min .11.

Multiplexed images obtained by performing 4i. 184A1 cells were deprived of serum and growth factor for 16h , and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 min before fixation.

For reference, see Gut et al. (2018) (Figure 1C–1E) and Kramer et al. (2022) (Supplementary Figure 1D and 1E).()(adapted from Kramer et al.)reproducibility of 4i across acquistion cyclesFigure 3. 4i is reproducible across acquisition cycles. The top panel shows representative images of repeated staining against phosphorylated ERK in different cycles (01, 07, and 13) in 184A1 cells exposed to 100 ng/mL of EGF. The bottom panel shows the bivariate plot of quantified pERK intensities for each combination of indicated 4i cycles. Scale bars: 20 um .# Cautionary pointsThe method described relies on employing mild conditions to elute bound antibodies from epitopes for cyclic acquisition. This is enabled by using a radical scavenging imaging buffer during fluorescence imaging. As the sample cannot be kept in this buffer at all times during processing since primary and secondary antibodies at times are bound, it is crucial to protect the sample from light exposure at these times. This is crucially the case after incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies, but before adding the radical scavenging imaging buffer.# Antibody selectionRarely, antibodies may be incompatible with the 4i protocol. As a result, the antibody staining appears altered or no signal is detected at all. Thus, it is advisable to perform a validation experiment prior to including new antibodies in a 4i panel. The aim of the validation experiment is to compare the staining of an antibody in conventional immunofluorescence and 4i. In a first step, perform (indirect) immunofluorescence using the unvalidated antibody and image the sample in imaging buffer. Next, elute the antibody and perform one round of 4i. Next, compare the antibody staining achieved using conventional immunofluorescence and 4i.# Antibody panel design and epitope prioritizationWhen designing a 4i antibody panel, it is important to identify the minimal concentration with which a reliable staining can be achieved. We generally start with the manufacturer’s recommended concentration and perform serial dilutions (1:2 steps) to identify the minimal concentration using conventional IF. Then, we assess whether that concentration yields discernable and reliable staining using the 4i protocol. If needed, increase the concentration only in small steps, as keeping the antibody concentration low will help in preventing photo-induced antibody crosslinking during imaging. Another important factor to consider when designing a 4i antibody panel is the potential change in detectability of epitopes as a consequence of multiple cycles of 4i. This can be assessed using repeated mock 4i cycles, by performing all the liquid handling steps but omitting the antibodies, and imaging interchanged with true 4i cycles (see workflow in Figure 4).()Figure 4. Standard workflow of an antibody panel design experimentThe following example describes a detectability assay for a 19 cycle 4i experiment. First, perform a 4i cycle including imaging. These images serve as staining references. Then, perform a round of elution, stain only with the secondary antibody, and image the sample. These images serve as reference whether the primary antibody can be eluted from their epitopes. Then, perform four cycles of elution followed by a complete cycle of 4i. This is treated as an antibody used during the seventh cycle. Repeat this, including the elution control, in a fashion yielding images that represent the staining obtained during cycles 1, 7, 13, and 19 (for an example, see Figure 5). Compare the images and identify whether the staining becomes less reliable in later cycles of 4i. In your antibody panel, prioritize antibodies for which altered staining patterns are observed in later cycles. In general, we find that phosphorylated specific antibodies are most prone to signal decay (with exceptions) after many rounds of 4i. Thus, we would advise to prioritize them, using them in earlier cycles.()Figure 5. Images obtained during an antibody panel design experiment. Lamin B is an example of an antibody that needs to be prioritized, due to altered signal in later cycles. The top panel depicts staining at the respective cycles with mock cycles (repeated elution but no antibody incubations) with both primary and secondary antibodies. Bottom panel depicts the residual signal after elution and staining with only secondary antibody.Residual antibody staining from previous cyclesYou may discover that signal from a previous 4i cycle is still detected in your current staining. This is due to a (partially) failed elution, which in turn is normally due to photo-induced antibody crosslinking during the imaging step of the previous cycle; thus, the residual signal from the previous cycle cannot be removed anymore. Using minimal antibody concentration and photon load during imaging prevents elution failures.# RecipesRecipes are calculated based on requirements for a standard 96-well plate and a standardized antibody dilution.Adjust accordingly for different volumes.

Coupling reaction of DOPE with pHrodo Red NHS-ester (Figure 1)Glassware should be used throughout the procedure, since lipids stick to plasticware, and chloroform can extract components from plasticware. Lipid stocks are handled on ice to reduce evaporation of chloroform during pipetting. In this section, the coupling of DOPE with pHrodo Red NHS-ester will be described. The procedure was also successfully performed using pHrodo Green STP-ester and Alexa Fluor 488 NHS-ester with DPPE as lipid. The labelling of short-chain lipids such as C_16C_6P E is also possible using this procedure. Note: The volumes given below serve just as an orientation. All volumes need to be calculated properly for each reaction depending on the used fluorophore and lipid.()Figure 1. Synthesis scheme of pHrodo red–labelled DOPECite as: Wiesner, W. et al. (2023).

Lipids are received in chloroform and packaged in sealed glass ampoules; store at -20~^°C until use. Note: For long-term storage, evaporate the solvent in a vacuum desiccator and store the lipids at -8O~^°C to avoid oxidation of unsaturated lipids. To evaporate the solvent, we use a glass desiccator connected to a chemically resistant vacuum pump, reaching a final vacuum of 10 mbar ( pm2 mbar) and a suction capacity of I.5m^3/h .2.  To prepare lipid stocks, transfer 10mg aliquots from the Avanti glass ampoule into glass screw neck vials. Evaporate the solvent from the glass vials in a desiccator at 250 mbar for ^3h with an additional incubation for 1h at 30 mbar. Close the vials with screw caps and store at -20~^°C until further use. Note: Chloroform is a hazardous solvent. Conduct all work in a fume hood while wearing proper protective clothing.3.  Remove desired lipid stocks from freezer, place on ice, and dissolve in chloroform to a final lipid concentration of 10mg/mL . Note: Lipids other than DOPE may have limited solubility in chloroform and require a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water. Further directions and guidance can be found on the Avanti Polar Lipids’ web site (https://avantilipids.com/products).4.  Transfer the desired quantity of lipid (usually between 1 and 2~mg for 500~ug of fluorophore NHS-ester) from the CHCl_3 stock solution to a round-bottom glass tube with a joint (NS 14). To maximize the reaction yield, we use a 2-fold molar excess of the lipid over fluorophore NHS- or STP-ester.5. Evaporate the solvent carefully under a Nu_2 stream at room temperature. After solvent removal, add a small magnetic stirring bar. Note: We slide the large end of a disposable glass Pasteur pipette into laboratory tubing attached to the N_2 gas cylinder. The flow is adjusted for a gentle stream of N2 gas through the pipette. The pipette can be held with a ring stand clamp to hold it in a fixed position.6.  Solubilize the fluorophore (500~ug) in 100~uL of the reaction solvent (see Recipes) and transfer it to the lipid-containing glass tube. Use approximately 100~uL for 500ug of fluorophore.7.  Add DIPEA to a final concentration of 130mM (e.g., 2.3~uL of DIPEA for 100~uL of reaction solvent). Note: DIPEA is toxic and can cause severe skin burns.8.  Seal the vessel with a glass plug (NS 14) and wrap it in aluminium foil. Place the vessel on top of a magnetic stirrer and let the reaction stir overnight at room temperature.# B.  Extraction of the labelled lipid1.  For extraction, add 0.5mL of CHCl_3 , 1 mL of MeOH, and 0.5mL of H_2O followed by another 0.5~mL of CHCl_3 and 0.5 mL of H_2O . The reaction mixture should be monophasic at first and then turn biphasic (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Result of the extraction process of fluorescent-labelled lipids. Coloured organic phase at the bottom and aqueous phase on top.Cite as: Wiesner, W. et al. (2023). Synthesis and Purification of Lipid-conjugated Fluorescent pH Sensors. Bio-protocol 13(11): e4694. DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4694. 62.  Transfer the organic phase (coloured bottom phase) to a new glass tube. Note: Short-chain lipids may require several subsequent washes with CHCl3 to yield a decolorized aqueous phase.3. Dry down the organic phase either by Nu_2 stream or using rotary evaporator, depending on the volume of solvent.4. After complete evaporation of the solvent, either continue with purification (see Section C1 and C2) or store the sample at -20~^°C .# C. Purification of the labelled lipid# C1. Purification via preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC)1.  Before starting the preparative TLC, the retention factor (R_f) of the product needs to be determined. For this, a test TLC can be performed (Figure 3).a.  Prepare an approximately 5cm wide TLC plate using a glass cutter.b.  Carefully draw a line approximately 1cm above the bottom of the plate with a pencil.c. Apply small volumes of the dissolved lipid stock and dissolved crude reaction product (e.g., with a glass Pasteur pipette) to the thin line at the bottom and let them dry completely.d.  Fill a TLC chamber with TLC eluent (see Recipes) up to a filling level of approximately 0.8cm .e. Close the lid and let the chamber saturate for approximately 5 min.f. Place the TLC plate carefully and upright into the chamber and close the lid. Remove the TLC plate from the chamber when the solvent front is approximately 1 cm from the top.g. Mark the solvent front line with a pencil.h. Let the TLC plate dry under the fume hood for approximately 1 h before taking an image under white light and long-wave UV, to make fluorophore-coupled lipids and unreacted fluorophore visible using e.g., the Chemidoc MP imaging system.i. Spray the plate with a primuline staining solution (see Recipes) to make lipids visible under longwave UV light after drying.j.  Calculate the R_f value as follows:R_f=fracD i s t a n c eo fp r o d u c tD i s t a n c eo fm o b i l ep h a s eR_f values of different fluorophore-conjugated DOPE lipids are 0.70 and 0.55 for pHrodo Red-DOPE and pHrodo Green-DOPE, respectively.()Figure 3.

The position of non-reacted DOPE and pHrodo Red-DOPE is indicated by an open and filled arrowhead, respectively. O, origin; F, solvent front of the chromatograms.2.  Prepare the preparative TLC by using a 20cm long TLC plate. a.  Draw a line 1cm above the bottom of a 20cm long TLC plate. b.  Dissolve the reaction product in 100~uL of CHCl_3 :MeOH (2:1, v/v). c. Apply the complete volume of dissolved product evenly on the line of the TLC plate, e.g., with a glass Pasteur pipette. d.  Let the TLC plate dry completely for approximately 1 h in the fume hood.3.  Fill a TLC chamber with TLC eluent (see Recipes) up to a filling level of approximately 0.8cm .4. Close the lid and let the chamber saturate for 20 min .5. Place the TLC plate upright in the chamber.6. Remove the TLC plate when the solvent front is approximately 1 cm beneath the top.7. Let TLC plate dry under the fume hood before taking an image under white light and under long-wave UV to make fluorophore-coupled lipids and unreacted fluorophore visible. A typical result is shown in Figure 4.()Figure 4. Preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) of a pHrodo-labelled lipid with a reference of the pure product on the right side of the TLC plate. The chromatogram shown was dried completely before photographing under white light. The origin is indicated by the black line.# C2. Re-extraction of the labelled lipid from preparative TLC1.  Carefully scrape off the product bands with a spatula and place the silica in pointed-bottom glass tubes (without joint, must fit into centrifuges).2.  Add 1~mL of the extraction solution (see Recipes) to each tube used and vortex each tube for 1 min.3. Centrifuge the tubes at 480× g for 10min at 8^°C .4. Transfer the liquid phase to a new glass tube.5. Repeat steps 2–4 until the liquid phase becomes colourless. Note: In the glass tube with the combined liquid phases, some silica might settle down at the bottom after a few minutes. The liquid phases can be transferred to a new vessel to remove silica.6. To induce a phase separation, add a 1:1 mixture of CHCl_3 and H_2O (v/v) . Transfer the organic phase (coloured bottom phase) to a new glass tube and dry down via Nu_2 stream or in a desiccator. Proceed with quantification (Section D) or store at -20~^°C# C3. Purification via column chromatographyAs an example, the purification of Alexa Fluor 488 DPPE is used. The exact gradient conditions can vary depending on the used lipid and fluorophore.1.  Prepare the column. a.  Provide the column with glass a wool plug to create a tight filter in front of the valve. b. Transfer enough CM Sepharose (typically approximately 20-25~mL of suspension) into a beaker to yield a stationary phase of 10cm height in the column (1cm diameter). c. Fill the Sepharose into the column in one go and run out surplus MeOH. Note: Be careful to never let the column run dry d. Close the valve before the top of the column runs dry. To remove air bubbles in the column, tap it gently e.g., with a cork ring while the Sepharose is settling. e. After settling, cover the Sepharose under a 1-3 mm thick layer of glass beads. Gradually rinse the MeOH to CHCl_3 according to the mixtures given in Table 2.Table 2. MeOH and CHCl3 ratios for rinsing the column()2.  Dissolve the reaction product in approximately 250~uL of CHCl_3 and carefully add it to the top of the column by moving in a circle along the wall to ensure an even distribution. Wash your sample tube with small volumes until colourless and apply it on the column (Figure 5A).3.  Perform the column chromatography while gradually increasing the MeOH content of the eluent, starting from pure CHCl_3 (Table 3). Collect all fractions separately in 10mL glass tubes.4.  Evaporate the solvent in all sample tubes either in a desiccator or with a rotary evaporator. The reaction product can be identified via TLC (Figure 5B). Continue with quantification or store the samples at -20^°C. .Table 3. Used MeOH and CHCl_3 ratios for the purification of A488-DPPE()()Figure 5. Purification via column chromatography. A.

The chromatogram shown was dried completely before photographing under ambient light.# D. Quantification of the reaction according to Bartlett (1959) and Ploier and Menon (2016), with small modifications to the protocolNote: All steps described below must be performed in a fume hood using appropriate personal protection and following lab safety guidelines.1.  Turn on the electrical heating block (placed in fume hood) and set it to 195 ^°C .2.  Prepare the sample tubes. We recommend preparing triplicates. a.  Dissolve the sample in an appropriate volume of CHCl_3 and transfer approximately 20nmol (assuming 100% yield) into a glass tube. b.  Evaporate the solvent via Nu_2 stream.3.  Prepare the standard tubes. We recommend preparing two standards per concentration. a.  Dilute an aliquot of the phosphate standard solution (see Recipes) to 0.4mM in deionized water. b.  Transfer 0 (0~uL) , 5 (12.5~uL) , 10 25 uL) , 20 ( 50~uL) , 30 75 uL) , 40 ( 100~uL) , and 50 nmol (125 uL) phosphate to glass tubes.4.  Add 650uL of perchloric acid to all tubes (including standards) and cover them loosely with glass marbles.5.  Heat all tubes in the heating block in the hood at 195 ^°C for approximately 1-2~h until the solution turns clear. Let the solution cool to room temperature.6. Turn on the water bath under the fume hood and set it to 80 ^°C .7. When samples are at room temperature, add 3.3mL of deionized water to each test tube and vortex it.8.  Add 0.5mL of molybdate solution (see Recipes) to each test tube and vortex it.9.  Add 0.5mL of ascorbic acid solution (see Recipes) to each test tube and vortex it.10. Boil all samples at 80^°C in the water bath for 10min .11. After cooling all the samples to room temperature, transfer each sample in duplicates to a 96-well plate.12. Determine the absorption of each well using a microplate reader set to 812nm . The reading can be repeated at 780 and/or 720nm to adjust for the best sensitivity.13. Average the duplicate and triplicate readings of each standard and sample, respectively.14. Subtract the value of the blank standard (0 nmol phosphate) from all standard and sample readings. This is the corrected absorbance.15. Plot standard curves (mean absorbance of wavelengths vs. nmol phosphate) and perform linear regression using e.g., Microsoft Excel, resulting in an equation of the type y=m x+b , where y is the absorbance, x is the phosphate concentration, and m is the slope; the intercept of the y-axis b is 0 after subtracting the value of the blank standard.16. Use the regression line to solve for sample concentration, by comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve obtained (Figure 6).()Figure 6. Typical plot of the results of a phosphate assay. Linear regression was applied to the averaged phosphate standard absorbance (812nm) values of all different concentrations (blue points and dotted line). The sample concentration (red point) was determined using the equation given by linear regression and included into the graph.17. Analyse your product using reliable methods for small amounts such as mass spectroscopy. A typical result is shown for pHrodo Green-labelled DOPE in Figure 7.()Figure 7. Exemplary MALDI-TOF mass spectra of pHrodo Green-labelled DOPE via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in negative ion mode (A) and positive ion mode (B). Since no chemical structure was published by the manufacturer and only an approximate molecular weight of 750 g/mol was given, indicated signals correspond to the expected product peak in the range of mass per charge (m/z) 1,250.Accordingly, m/z1,241.2 corresponds to the deprotonated product molecule and m/z1small,243.3 to the proton adduct.# Recipes1.

The abnormal expansion of adipose tissue leads to the progression of obesity. The adipose tissue microenvironment is affected by pathological hypertrophy of adipocytes, highly correlated with systemic metabolic disorders. In vivo genetic modification is a great tool for understanding the role of genes involved in such processes. However, obtaining new conventional engineered mice is time consuming and costly.

Most murine models of BPD expose newborn pups to only one of these risk factors—more commonly postnatal hyperoxia—thereby mimicking the vital increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO_2) that preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units often require. To improve representation of the multifactorial origins of BPD and BPD-PH, we established a double hit model, combining antenatal systemic inflammation followed by postnatal hyperoxia. On embryonic day 14, pups are exposed to systemic maternal inflammation via a single intraperitoneal injection of 150ug/kg of lipopolysaccharide to the dam. Within 24h after birth, pups and dams are randomized and exposed to gas with either an FiO_2 of 0.21 (room air) or 0.65 (hyperoxia 65% ). In our BPD and BPD-PH double hit model, we can obtain multiple readouts from individual pups that include echocardiography, lung histology and immunohistochemistry, ex vivo Chi -ray micro computed tomography, and pulmonary and plasmatic immunity by RNA, protein, or flow cytometry.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Setup of an experimental chamber.A custom plexiglass chamber is connected to a humidifier and ventilator. Humidified oxygen gas with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO_2) of 0.65 is passed through the hyperoxia chamber at a flow rate of 10 L/min (air chamber has a FiO_2 of 0.21). Power lab recording system records temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels in chambers. Humidity and temperature are kept constant at 50%-60% and 22^°C , respectively. Light is cycled in a 12h day/night rhythm. Chamber setup included below the schematic for comparison.# B. Time mating1.  Use C57BL/6J mice.2.  Breeders are housed in enhanced specific pathogen free 2 conditions.3.  Preparation of female breeders: a.  Select 6–14-week-old females for consideration. i.  Younger females might not be sexually mature. ii.  Older females mate less reliably. b.  One to two weeks prior to timed mating, house females together. Group housed females to synchronize their estrous cycles. This phenomenon is known as the “LeeBoot effect” (Van Der Lee and Boot, 1955). c. Three days prior to timed mating, place material from a stud male cage into the female cages. The exposure of group housed female mice to urine from a male mouse increases the chance of ovulation on the third night following exposure. This phenomenon is known as the “Whitten effect” (Whitten, 1956).4.  Preparation of male breeders: a.  Select 6–14-week-old males. Preference proved stud males as sexual experience improves male reproductive performance (Swaney et al., 2012). b.  One to two weeks prior to timed mating, separate the stud males. This allows the sperm count to increase and libido to recover from any previous mating.5.  Timed mating: a.  Place 1–2 females together with a stud male in a cage. b.  Check for viscous vaginal plugs in the mornings. i.  Components of the male ejaculate coagulate to form a hard plug that blocks the opening of the vagina and is an indicator of copulation. However, 37.1% of females that plug do not become pregnant (Heyne et al., 2015).ii.  A positive plug is considered embryonic age (E)0.5 if pregnancy occurs. c. After 48h together, separate breeding pairs.# C. Early pregnancy detection1. Monitor body weight gain of females. Pregnant mice gain on average 3.49:g from E0 to E7–10 (Heyne et al., 2015).Or2. Palpate the pregnant dam’s abdomen with the thumb and forefinger at E12. A positive pregnancy feels like a string of beads.# D. Antenatal inflammatory hit 1 at E141.  Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the dam: a.  Determine the dam’s body weight. b.  Prepare LPS injection. ii.  Reconstitute LPS powder in water for injection. iii.  Final concentration injected is 150ug/kg . iv.  Final volume injected is 1 uL/g . c. Inject LPS into the lower right quadrant of the dam at a 45^° angle with an insulin syringe (Figure 3). Adverse events associated with i.p. injection are related to errors in the placement of the injection. Ensure that the needle passes through the skin, muscle, and peritoneum of the abdomen without penetrating any abdominal organs. d. Monitor dams closely to ensure welfare of animals. If miscarriage occurs, humanely euthanize the dam and perform a postmortem.()Figure 3. Intraperitoneal injection site for LPS on day 14 of gestation in the pregnant dam# E.  Postnatal inflammatory hit 21.  Dams deliver pups naturally at E19–21 in the saccular stage of lung development (Backstrom et al., 2011).Cite as: Garrick, S. P. et al. (2022). Murine Double Hit Model for Neonatal Cardiopulmonary Diseases: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia  (BPD)  and  Pulmonary  Hypertension  Associated  with  BPD.  Bio-protocol  12(21):  e4669.  DOI: 6 10.21769/BioProtoc.4669.2.  The saccular stage is most susceptible to lung injury in mice (Backstrom et al., 2011), comparable to a premature human baby at 24–38 weeks gestation (Swaney et al., 2012).3.  Within 24h of birth, randomly assign pups and dams to either:a. Hyperoxia FiO_2 of 0.65) Develop cardiopulmonary diseaseb. Normal room air ( FiO_2 of 0.21) Control animals4.  Set up foster pairs to avoid oxygen toxicity in the dam; pair one dam with pups in a hyperoxia cage with a counterpart dam and pups in an air cage. In case of an odd number of deliveries: a.  Allocate the extra dam to an air group. Or b.  Distribute the pups from the extra litter into the other litters under the experiment.Choose experimental endpoints to determine different readouts.a. Three days of 65% hyperoxia Pulmonary immunity: Postnatal exposure of pups to hyperoxia induces an immediate IL-1 and type 2 cytokine pulmonary immune response, which is most evident within the first three days of life. Accordingly, we see increased pulmonary IL- 1 (20-fold), IL-1 receptor antagonist (2-fold) (Nold et al., 2013; Rudloff et al., 2017) type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) (4- to 53-fold), and type 2 chemokines (CCL1, CCL17) (11- to 31-fold) (Lao et al., 2022).b. Five days of 65% hyperoxia i.  Pulmonary immunity Transcription factors that regulate the development of all innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) ( P l z f and Id2) and ILC2s (Tcf7 and Bcl11b) are up to 23% lower after hyperoxia (Lao et al., 2022). There is a 2-fold increase in type 2 helper (TH2) cells after hyperoxia (Lao et al., 2022). ii.  Pulmonary angiogenesis Hyperoxia elevates vascular endothelial growth factor by 1.4-fold and endothelin-1 by 1.4-fold in murine lungs (Bui et al., 2019).c.  Fourteen days of 65% hyperoxia i.  Alveoli Early changes in alveolar structure (Nold et al., 2013).d.  Twenty-eight days of 65% hyperoxia i.  Structural changes 1). Alveoli Twenty-eight days marks the end of the alveolar stage of lung development in the mouse, similar to 2–3 years of age in humans (Backstrom et al., 2011). Hyperoxia reduces alveolar number (25%-44%) , increases alveolar size (40%-230%) ), and reduces surface/volume ratio (18%-35%) (Figure 4) (Nold et al., 2013; Royce et al., 2016; Rudloff et al., 2017). These emphysematous changes in alveoli impair lung function by reducing the diffusing capacity of the lung (Pellegrino et al., 2005)()Figure 4. Emphysematous changes in lung morphology (H&E staining) at 28 days of life after antenatal LPS and postnatal exposure to f65% hyperoxia compared to air controls in C57BL/6J mice (sourced from Rudloff et al., 2017).Scale bars 100um , ×200 magnification.# 2). AirwaysHyperoxia increases airway epithelial thickness (25%), subepithelial collagen deposition (200%) , expression of a -smooth muscle actin (50%) , and expression of the proliferation marker cyclin D1 mRNA (260%) (Royce et al., 2016). However, hyperoxia does not alter the airway goblet cell mucus production (Royce et al., 2016). 3). Pulmonary vascular bed Hyperoxia reduces the number of small vessels mathit4-5 um diameter) (84%) (Bui et al., 2019; Lao et al., 2022). No differences in the expression of a -smooth muscle actin and endothelin receptor type-A after hyperoxia (Bui et al., 2019). 4). Heart Hyperoxia increases cardiac fibrosis (2.2-fold) and fibrotic/inflammatory markers galectin-3 and CCL2 (C-C motif) (Bui et al., 2019). 5). Brain Hyperoxia does not cause apoptosis, cortical neuronal lamination, temporal cortical width (at hippocampus), white matter myelination, hemorrhage, loss of neurons, gliosis, inflammation, or any other significant morphologic abnormalities in C57Bl/6J mice (Rudloff et al., 2017). ii.  Functional changes 1). In vivo The inversely related surrogate marker time to peak velocity/right ventricular ejection time, as measured by echocardiography, increases in hyperoxic pups (0.27 compared to 0.32 in air controls) (Bui et al., 2019; Lao et al., 2022). 2). Ex vivo Hyperoxia increases luminal contraction of airways to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist methacholine ^(10-3,000nM) (89%) compared to air (44%) in precision cut lung slices (Royce et al., 2016). Pulmonary arterial contraction to the vasoconstrictors endothelin 1 and U46619 is not altered by hyperoxia in precision cut lung slices (Bui et al., 2019). iii.  Cellular immunity of the lung After  hyperoxia,  the  overall  number  of  immune  cells  (neutrophils,  lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells) is approximately 3.1-fold lower. However, increased activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as elevated IL- 1 is still evident in the lungs (Nold et al., 2013). Sixty days (28 days hyperoxia, followed by 32 days room air) Hyperoxia reduces vessel numbers at each branching generation in the murine lung ( -18% in generation 2 and -21% in generation 3) (Bui et al., 2019).Cite as: Garrick, S.

Record oxygen application, temperature, and humidity with power lab instrument and Chart 5 Pro software.2.  Record assessments of animal welfare.# G. Fostering of pups (Figure 5 and Video 1)Adult mice are more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced oxygen toxicity than neonatal mice (Frank et al., 1978). Therefore, dams need to be rotated between room air and hyperoxia pups in a three-day cycle to limit hyperoxiainduced toxicity. It is important to conduct this procedure promptly, so that pups are in the experimental conditions for as long as possible. Top up food and water during this step to minimize unnecessary opening of the hyperoxia chamber.1.  Remove cages from air and hyperoxia chambers.2.  Take one pair of one hyperoxia and one air cage at a time. a.  Swap the pups between the paired dams i.  Air pups will be moved into the dam’s cage that was previously in hyperoxia. ii.  Hyperoxia pups will be moved into the dam’s cage that was previously in air. b.  Cover the pups in bedding material from the new cage i.  This procedure masks the scent of the other dam. ii.  This reduces the likelihood of rejection from the foster dam. c.  Repeat for all paired cages3.  Return cages to air and hyperoxia chambers. a.  Pups are in the same conditions. b. Dams previously in hyperoxia chamber are now housed in the air chamber; however, the pups stay under their allocated experimental condition. C. Dams previously in air chamber are now housed in the hyperoxia chamber; however, the pups stay under their allocated experimental condition.()# Figure 5.

Anesthetize the pup with isoflurane per open-drop method (Risling et al., 2012).2.  Euthanize the pup a.  Cervical dislocation i.  Place the thumb and forefinger in between the head and neck of the animal. Note: The spinal column should be palpable. ii.  Pinch the thumb and forefinger together and push down simultaneously until the cervical spine is cleanly separated.1). Ensure that you do not apply too much pressure as the trachea needs to be intact for later inflation of the lung. 2). Pinch the foot with the forceps to ensure mouse is dead before dissecting.3.  Dissection (Figure 7, Figure 8, and Video 2)a.  Pin the mouse on a foam dissection board on its back with its four limbs spread out.b.  Hook the front teeth of the mouse with a suture; then, pull tight and pin to foam board. This procedure helps to straighten the trachea to allow better inflation.c.  Dissect the mouse i.  Cut through the ventral surface of the mouse from the sternum up to the chin. ii.  Open the chest cavity such that the entire lung is visible. iii.  Expose the trachea. 1). The trachea is enclosed by the thyroid. 2). Grasp the thyroid with forceps and pull apart to remove. 3). Wipe away any excess blood with gauze soaked in PBS or use a cotton tip applicator. 4). Delicately cut away tissue around trachea so that the forceps can reach underneath. 5). Place two strings of suture underneath the trachea.d.  Samples for pulmonary immunity i.  Ensure that the left lobe is clearly visible. ii.  Loop a piece of suture around the left lobe of the lung by holding the suture with your forceps and lift the lobe with a cotton tip applicator. Organ will stick to the cotton without being ripped or damaged. Lungs exposed to hyperoxia are fragile. iii.  Now loop the suture around the left bronchus and tie the left lobe off. iv.  Ensure knots are tight so that no leakage occurs during the right lung inflation. v.  Cut off the left tied lobe, cut in two, and place in separate labeled 1.7~mL~ microtubules. Immediately snap freeze in liquid Nu_2 (following all safety protocols of your institution) for later mRNA and protein analysis. Store at -80~^°C until ready for processing.e.  Inflation of the right lung lobes i.  Insert a 24G cannula into the trachea. ii.  Tie the cannula in place with one of the sutures threaded earlier underneath the trachea. iii.  Attach the cannula to a gravity perfusion apparatus. iv.  Infuse the right lung lobes with 4% PFA (pH7.4) ) under constant 20 cm H_2O of hydrostatic pressure. 1). Reconstitute PFA powder with PBS. 2). Full inflation is determined by the tip of the post-caval lobe turning pointy. v.  Tie off the trachea with the second suture in front of the cannula to prevent backflow of PFA. vi.  Place pup on ice for 10min .f. Samples for histology i.  Remove right lung lobes from thorax and place in tube with 4% PFA. ii.  Keep in 4% PFA for a minimum of ^6h . iii.  Process for paraffin embedding and sectioning.()Figure 7.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-482","title":"Reconstitution of Membrane-tethered Postsynaptic Density Condensates Using Supported Lipid Bilayer","text":"Reconstitution of Membrane-tethered Postsynaptic Density Condensates Using Supported Lipid Bilayer\n\n# Abstract\n\nEukaryotic cells utilize sub-cellular compartmentalization to restrict reaction components within a defined localization to perform specified biological functions. One way to achieve this is via membrane enclosure; however, many compartments are not bounded with lipid membrane bilayers. In the past few years, it has been increasingly recognized that molecular components in non- or semi-membrane-bound compartments might form biological condensates autonomously (i.e., without requirement of energy input) once threshold concentrations are reached, via a physical chemistry process known as liquid–liquid phase separation. Molecular components within these compartments are stably maintained at high concentrations and separated from the surrounding diluted solution without the need for a physical barrier. Biochemical reconstitution using recombinantly purified proteins has served as an important tool for understanding organizational principles behind these biological condensates. Common techniques include turbidity measurement, fluorescence imaging of 3D droplets, and atomic force microscopy measurements of condensate droplets. Nevertheless, many molecular compartments are semi-membrane-bound with one side attached to the plasma membrane and the other side exposed to the cytoplasm and/or attached to the cytoskeleton; therefore, reconstitution in 3D solution cannot fully recapture their physiological configuration. Here, we utilize a postsynaptic density minimal system to demonstrate that biochemical reconstitution can be applied on supported lipid bilayer (SLB); we have also incorporated actin cytoskeleton into the reconstitution system to mimic the molecular organization in postsynaptic termini. The same system could be adapted to study other membraneproximal, cytoskeleton-supported condensations.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-503","title":"Optimized Expression and Isolation of Recombinant Active Secreted Proteases Using Pichia pastoris","text":"Optimized Expression and Isolation of Recombinant Active Secreted Proteases Using Pichia pastoris\n\n# Abstract\n\nRecombinant proteins of high quality are crucial starting materials for all downstream applications, but the inherent complexities of proteins and their expression and purification create significant challenges. The Pichia pastoris yeast is a highly useful eukaryotic protein expression system. Pichia’s low cost, genetic tractability, rapid gene expression, and scalability make it an ideal expression system for foreign proteins. Here, we developed a protocol that has optimized the expression and isolation of a non-mammalian secreted metalloprotease, where we can routinely generate recombinant proteins that are pure and proteolytically active. We maximized growth and protein production by altering the feeding regime, through implementation of a non-fermentable and non-repressing carbon source during the methanol-induction phase. This approach increased biomass production and yielded milligrams of recombinant protein. Downstream applications involving active, recombinant fungal proteases, such as conjugation to nanoparticles and structure-related studies, are greatly facilitated with this improved, standardized approach.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  96-well assay plate with black wall and clear, flat bottom (Corning, catalog number: 3904)\n2.

The recombinant Mpr1^6XHIS protein of focus was isolated from a strain of P. pastoris transformed with a construct composed of MPR1 cDNA isolated from Cryptococcus neoformans KN99 with a 6XHIS tag at the C-terminus in a pPIC9K backbone, as described in the main article (Aaron and Gelli, 2020). This plasmid confers resistance to G418, which was added to agar plates (4~mg/mL) in both the original selection of transformed P. pastoris and while expanding frozen (-80~^°C) stocks for the current protocol. We handled open cultures in a sterile field under an open flame throughout this protocol, checking for bacterial contamination at least once every 24h by brightfield microscopy. The volumes and concentrations described below were optimal for our purposes but may need to be scaled for other experiments. The protocol below can be divided into three stages: (1) growth, induction, and expression; (2) isolation and purification; and (3) verification and storage.# A. Expression of recombinant Mpr1 protein1.  Streak the Pichia pastoris GS116 <Cn MPR1> strain (Aaron and Gelli, 2020) on a YPD+G418 (4 mg/mL) agar plate. Incubate the plate at 30^°C for 72h . Note: Any gene of interest can be subcloned in expression vectors for P. pastoris.2.  Select a single colony from the G418 plate and transfer directly to a 250~mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask containing 50mL of BMGY media (see Recipes) using a flame-sterilized inoculating loop. Note: Using a baffled Erlenmeyer flask greatly increases biomass production compared to a non-baffled Erlenmeyer flask.3.  Incubate the P. pastoris culture at 30~^°C for 24~h , shaking at 300~rpm . Cover the flasks loosely with aluminum foil allowing for gas exchange.4.  After 24h , decant cultures into 50mL centrifuge tubes and spin down at 3,724× g for 5min . Note: The culture is easily contaminated due to the nutrient-rich BMGY medium; thus, examine the culture for any possible contamination after every 24~h period. In our case, the cultures were examined by brightfield microscopy to rule out contamination.5.  Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet 1–3 times using 25~mL of BMMY (see Recipes) and vortex the pellet until it is fully resuspended. Spin down the pellet at 3,724× g between washes. Resuspend cells in BMMY and measure the optical density at 600 nm(OD_600) . Note: Following steps 1–5, we typically see an O D_600 of approximately 25 in 20 mL of BMMY.6.  Add the cell mixture to the desired volume of BMMY, in order to dilute the culture to a final OD_600=1 . Cover the flask with sterile cheesecloth, allowing for appropriate gas exchange.7.  Incubate the induced culture at 30 ^°C , shaking, for 24h .8.  Add sorbitol and methanol to the culture to a final concentration of 50g/L and 0.5% , respectively. Incubate at 30 ^°C , shaking, for 24h . Note: Sorbitol is a non-repressing carbon source and we found that a co-feeding regime of methanol with sorbitol increases biomass production (Figures 1 and 2).()Figure 1. Visualization of Pichia biomass production. A. Initiating induction in BMMY with OD_600= 1.0. B. Following 24~h induction in BMMY and just prior to co-feeding with 50~g/L sorbitol and 0.5% methanol. C. Following 24~h of co-feeding with sorbitol and methanol. At this stage, measurements of OD_600 are typically well over 18.()Figure 2. Optical densities of Pichia cultures supplemented with sorbitol. A comparison of the optical densities (OD_600) of cultures with 0.5% methanol (MeOH) or co-fed with 0.5% MeOH and 50~g/L of sorbitol or 2% MeOH and 50~g/L of sorbitol. The cultures were co-fed following 24~h inoculation of the Pichia strain in BMMY media at a starting OD_600 of 1. The OD_600 measurements of the cultures were recorded 24h after the co-feeding was initiated.# B. Isolation and purification of recombinant Mpr1 protein1.  For PureCube INDIGO Ni-MagBeads, mix and aliquot beads in a 15mL conical centrifuge tube and briefly centrifuge the beads; then, place the aliquot near a strong magnet in order to remove and replace the storage buffer supernatant with phosphate-buffered saline, p H7.4 . Keep the beads on ice and see protocols provided by the manufacturer (PureCube) for further information. Note: If inducing a 25O:m L culture, use 750mu L of beads from storage. This equals approximately l88mu L of beads 25% of storage solution contains beads with binding capacity of 70 mg/mL).2.  Autoclave the beads for 15min on liquid cycle. Allow beads to cool before proceeding.3.  Measure the final OD_600 of the P. pastoris culture. Decant the culture into centrifuge bottles. Note: The addition of sorbitol with cultures induced with 0.5% methanol (MeOH) significantly increased the optical density O D_600) of the Pichia cultures from 8 to >20 (Figure 2).4.  Centrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 30^°C. . Decant and keep the supernatant.5.  Add 1.5 mL of 25% (v/v) Ni-MagBeads per 500~mL of collected culture supernatant. Incubate at 30~^°C , shaking at 250rpm , for 30min .6.  Collect the Ni-MagBeads from the supernatant using a strong magnet. Decant the supernatant into a fresh vessel, then remove the magnet and resuspend the beads in 6mL of binding buffer. Transfer resuspended beads in a 15~mL conical tube. Repeat at least twice. Wash with 10~mL of binding buffer until all beads have been collected.7.  Place the collected beads in a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 4^°C .8.  Magnetically pellet the MagBeads and remove binding buffer. Add 10 times the bead volume of wash buffer to the beads. Remove the magnet and vortex for at least 2min . Note: Each 25Om L culture volume, receiving l88mu L of beads initially, is washed with 1.88 mL wash buffer at this step. We found that washing once was sufficient to remove any foreign matter, but still washed thrice without appreciable loss of MagBeads.9.  Briefly centrifuge and collect beads at the bottom of the tube with a magnet to facilitate the exchange of wash buffer for elution buffer. Use twice the initial bead volume of elution buffer. Vortex beads for 5min and centrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 4^°C . Note: Multiple elution steps can be performed at this stage to enrich for Mpr1; however, we found that one elution step was sufficient.10. Transfer the protein-containing elution buffer supernatant to a 10kDa NMWL Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit.11. Centrifuge and concentrate the sample at 4,000× g for 15min at 4 ^°C . Measure protein concentration by the method of Bradford (Bradford, 1976). Note: Timing for this step may vary depending on desired final concentration and quantity of elution buffer added. In our case, the above conditions yielded approximately 300mu L of protein suspended in elution buffer. PBS was exchanged for elution buffer following step 11, centrifuging for 8 min instead of 15. On average, 2.5 mg of Mpr1 was extracted from a 500 mL BMMY culture (Figure 3).()Figure 3. Mpr1 production in media supplemented with sorbitol. A comparison of the quantity of Mpr1 recombinant protein extracted from cultures grown with 0.5% methanol (MeOH), 0.5% MeOH supplemented with 25:g/L of sorbitol, or 0.5% MeOH with 50 g/L of sorbitol. Data represent Mpr1 extractions from four different cultures. The addition of sorbitol boosted Mpr1 protein production when MeOH concentrations were maintained at 0.5% .12. Assess the purity of the recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Note: Coomassie or silver-stained SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gels will visualize isolated recombinant proteins. Silver protein stains are an ultra-sensitive method of protein detection, which could be used to examine whether contaminating proteins were present in the isolation. Following step _l l , examination of Mpr1 recombinant protein by silver-stained SDS-PAGE electrophoresis yielded a single polypeptide band (Figure 4).# C. Activity, purity, and storage of Mpr11.  After saving a portion of the Mpr1 recombinant protein for proteolytic activity and other assays, flash freeze the remainder in liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C . Note: Proteolytic activity determination requires 50mu L or approximately I O% of the final eluted volume. We conducted proteolytic activity assays under various storage conditions (data not shown) and found that cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen produced only a small loss of proteolytic activity compared to protein that had not been subjected to freeze-thaw.2. Program the microplate reader to measure fluorescence (485/538 nm) excitation/emission) at 5m i n intervals over at least one hour, shaking between reads. Sensitivity should be set to medium or low.3.  Following the manufacturer’s instructions, thaw aliquots of FTC-casein (5:mg/mL) and TPCK-trypsin (50 mg/mL) gradually at 4^°C . Dilute FTC-casein in tris-buffered saline to 10ug/mL and store temporarily at 4^°C . Note: 10 mL of 10 µg/mL FTC-Casein is sufficient for a 96-well plate.4.  Dilute Mpr1 recombinant protein in TBS to 200 ug/mL and 20 ug/mL , such that there is at least 350~uL of each dilution when finished. Set aside 350uL of the TBS used in these dilutions to serve as a blank.5.  Dilute a thawed TPCK-trypsin aliquot to 1 ug/mL in TBS.6. Add 100~uL of 200 ug/mL Mpr1, 20 ug/mL Mpr1, 1 ug/mL TPCK-trypsin, and TBS blank to triplicate wells in an opaque-walled (black or white), clear-bottom 96-well plate.7.  Add 100uL of 10ug/mL FTC-casein to each well. Note: This is best done with a multichannel pipette due to the time-sensitivity of this step, although a serological pipette may suffice.8.  Remove the lid on the plate and place it in the plate reader. Begin the program at 5~min post FTC-casein addition. Proteolytic activity is measured by the decrease in fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal (Figure 5).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction and Preparation\nThe steps in the following segments were done using a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, for the expression of recombinant proteins.\nThe recombinant Mpr1^6XHIS protein of focus was isolated from a strain of P. pastoris transformed with a construct composed of MPR1 cDNA isolated from Cryptococcus neoformans KN99 with a 6XHIS tag at the C-terminus in a pPIC9K backbone.\nThis plasmid confers resistance to G418, which was added to agar plates (4~mg/mL) in both the original selection of transformed P. pastoris and while expanding frozen (-80~^°C) stocks for the current protocol.\n## Expression of Recombinant Mpr1 Protein\n## Growth and Induction\nStreak the Pichia pastoris GS116 <Cn MPR1> strain on a YPD+G418 (4 mg/mL) agar plate.\nIncubate the plate at 30^°C for 72h.\nSelect a single colony from the G418 plate and transfer directly to a 250~mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask containing 50mL of BMGY media.\n## Incubation and Preparation for Induction\nIncubate the P. pastoris culture at 30~^°C for 24~h, shaking at 300~rpm.\nCover the flasks loosely with aluminum foil allowing for gas exchange.\nDecant cultures into 50mL centrifuge tubes and spin down at 3,724× g for 5min.\n## Washing and Resuspension\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet 1–3 times using 25~mL of BMMY.\nVortex the pellet until it is fully resuspended.\nSpin down the pellet at 3,724× g between washes.\n## Dilution and Incubation\nResuspend cells in BMMY and measure the optical density at 600 nm(OD_600).\nAdd the cell mixture to the desired volume of BMMY, in order to dilute the culture to a final OD_600=1.\nCover the flask with sterile cheesecloth, allowing for appropriate gas exchange.\n## Induction and Co-feeding\nIncubate the induced culture at 30 ^°C, shaking, for 24h.\nAdd sorbitol and methanol to the culture to a final concentration of 50g/L and 0.5%, respectively.\nIncubate at 30 ^°C, shaking, for 24h.\n## Isolation and Purification of Recombinant Mpr1 Protein\n## Preparation of Ni-MagBeads\nMix and aliquot beads in a 15mL conical centrifuge tube and briefly centrifuge the beads.\nPlace the aliquot near a strong magnet in order to remove and replace the storage buffer supernatant with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4.\n## Autoclaving and Cooling\nAutoclave the beads for 15min on liquid cycle.\nAllow beads to cool before proceeding.\n## Measurement and Centrifugation\nMeasure the final OD_600 of the P. pastoris culture.\nDecant the culture into centrifuge bottles.\nCentrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 30^°C.\n## Binding and Washing\nAdd 1.5 mL of 25% (v/v) Ni-MagBeads per 500~mL of collected culture supernatant.\nIncubate at 30~^°C, shaking at 250rpm, for 30min.\nCollect the Ni-MagBeads from the supernatant using a strong magnet.\n## Elution and Concentration\nPlace the collected beads in a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 4^°C.\nMagnetically pellet the MagBeads and remove binding buffer.\nAdd 10 times the bead volume of wash buffer to the beads.\n## Final Elution and Concentration\nUse twice the initial bead volume of elution buffer.\nVortex beads for 5min and centrifuge at 3,724× g for 5min at 4^°C.\nTransfer the protein-containing elution buffer supernatant to a 10kDa NMWL Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit.\n## Verification and Storage of Mpr1\n## Assessment of Purity\nAssess the purity of the recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.\nCoomassie or silver-stained SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gels will visualize isolated recombinant proteins.\n## Storage and Activity Assay\nFlash freeze the remainder in liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C.\nProgram the microplate reader to measure fluorescence (485/538 nm) excitation/emission) at 5min intervals over at least one hour, shaking between reads.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Biochemical & Molecular Functional Analysis"}}

Murine experimental models are by far the most convenient and inexpensive research model to study wound healing, as they offer great variability in genetic alterations and disease models. To overcome the obstacle of contraction biasing wound healing kinetics, our group invented the splinted excisional wound model. While other rodent wound healing models have been used in the past, the splinted excisional wound model has persisted as the most used model in the field of wound healing. Here, we present a detailed protocol of updated and refined techniques necessary to utilize this model, generate results with high validity, and accurately analyze the collected data. This model is simple to conduct and provides an easy, standardizable, and replicable model of human-like wound healing.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Excisional wounding (Table 2)Time: 12–30 min per mouse (after sufficient practice), time varies depending on operator’s skills and mouse line. Diabetic mice (high BMI) tend to be easier to handle during surgery than thin wildtype mice.1.  Prepare surgical field with heating pad set at 40^°C , surgical drape, and anesthesia system.2. Anesthetize mouse with isoflurane at a flow rate of 5% in 100% oxygen (flow rate 1 L/min ).3. Inject buprenorphine SR 0.5mg/kg subcutaneously 5 min prior to incision and apply ophthalmic ointment on both eyes.4. Maintain anesthetized state with 1%-1.5% isoflurane; monitor mouse every 90~s for changes in breathing rate.5. Place mouse in a prone position on the prepared surgical table.6. Shave complete dorsum of mouse from the neck to the root of the tail and to the sides; shave until the beginning of all four extremities.7. Apply depilatory cream on the shaved area for 30~s . Use wet gauze swabs to remove all remaining cream and fur.8.  Disinfect skin with three alternating betadine and alcohol wipes in a circular fashion.9.  Place sterile drape over the mouse, leaving the surgical area free.10. Use the biopsy punch to outline the pattern for excision of skin on the dorsum of the mice (Figure 1B).11. Create two wounds on the dorsum of the mice with the biopsy punch.12. Push the biopsy punch firmly onto the skin and then twist fairly quickly in swift circulating motions to cut through the dermis. Notes: a.  Fixate skin between fingers to create tension on the skin in order to excise biopsy. b.  Do not push too hard or you will wound the underlying muscle. c.  Wet the skin with an alcohol swab to ease friction force from the biopsy punch.13. Excise skin (with the aid of scissors if necessary).14. Take out the splint from ethanol bath and let it dry on sterile surgical area.15. Apply minimal amounts of Vetbond to the splint and place it carefully around the wound. Notes: a.  Leave an area of the splint without Vetbond for forceps to grab. Otherwise, the splint will be glued to the forceps. b.  Make sure to apply enough Vetbond on the silicone splints so that the splint sticks well to the skin, but care must be taken to not apply Vetbond onto the wound.16. Use 6-0 sutures to apply eight interrupted sutures fixating the splint to the surrounding skin (Figure 1B).17. Take a picture of the wound with a ruler for documentation and baseline for analysis of wound closure. Note: Be sure to try to always take the images from the same angle, orientation, and distance from each wound to promote consistency.Table 2. Excisional wounding()Cite as: Fischer, K. S. et al.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-548","title":"A Cartographic Tool to Predict Disease Risk-associated Pseudo-Dynamic Networks from Tissue-specific Gene Expression","text":"A Cartographic Tool to Predict Disease Risk-associated Pseudo-Dynamic Networks from Tissue-specific Gene Expression\n\n# Abstract\n\nUnderstanding how genes are differentially expressed across tissues is key to reveal the etiology of human diseases. Genes are never expressed in isolation, but rather co-expressed in a community; thus, they co-act through intricate but well-orchestrated networks. However, existing approaches cannot coalesce the full properties of gene–gene communication and interactions into networks. In particular, the unavailability of dynamic gene expression data might impair the application of existing network models to unleash the complexity of human diseases. To address this limitation, we developed a statistical pipeline named DRDNetPro to visualize and trace how genes dynamically interact with each other across diverse tissues, to ascertain health risk from static expression data. This protocol contains detailed tutorials designed to learn a series of networks, with the illustration example from the GenotypeTissue Expression (GTEx) project. The proposed toolbox relies on the method developed in our published paper (Chen et al., 2022), coding all genes into bidirectional, signed, weighted, and feedback looped networks, which will provide profound genomic information enabling medical doctors to design precise medicine.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nTo predict disease risk-associated pseudo-dynamic networks, we need the following inputs from each subject: predicted disease risk (named “agent” below), one covariate of interest (e.g., smoking), and pre-processed gene expression data. The detailed procedures of how to generate the agent, train the network model, and visualize the results are listed below.All the programs, demo data for illustration, and brief tutorials for the following procedures can be found in our GitHub repository (https://chencxxy28.github.io/DRDNetPro/articles/NAME-OF-VIGNETTE.html).# A. Predict the agent (Tutorial 1 in the GitHub repository)1.  Prepare the data for training prediction values of the agent Before predicting the agent, users need to prepare the data for model training. The data needs to be a matrix, including the outcome in the first column and all potential predictors in the remaining columns. Do not include the intercept as one column. The outcome in this protocol has values of 0 and 1, corresponding to healthy and diseased subjects, respectively. More complicated outcomes with multiple categories are not considered in the current bio-protocol, as we regard this as future work. One remedy for the case of multiple categories are to categorize the outcome into binaries, which is also often applied in practice. All values in the matrix should be numeric. The missing data is allowed in this training process, though it is always recommended to have complete data as an input.For demonstration, we have prepared a toy data example in this tutorial, which can be accessed from https://chencxxy28.github.io/DRDNetPro/articles/web/data.html. See details in the Data analysis section below.2.  Select a training methodThere is no unique way to predict the agent. Either statistical regression models or machine learning algorithms can be applied. In our program, we allow the users to specify the following commonly used methods: conventional logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.a.  Logistic regression—This is the most conventional statistical tool to predict disease risk, which will lead to a probability-scaled risk. Run the function ddotglm()^ in R to fit the training model, and then run “fitted()” to extract the predicted agent.b. Random forest—This is a machine learning method with an ensemble of decision trees. It builds and combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. It is a non-linear classification algorithm. There are several R packages available for implementing random forest. We provide demo codes based on the package “ranger”. The data required for “ranger” should be in a matrix form, where the outcome should be a factor, to enable running classification trees. After preparing the data, run the function “ranger()” to train the model, and run the function “predict()” to extract the predicted agent.c. XGBoost—This is another machine learning method with an efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework. It provides built-in k -fold cross-validation (CV) Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machines, with column and row sampling (per split and per tree) for better generalization. We provide demo codes based on the package “XGBoost”. A specific type of input data is required by “XGBoost”, where the response and predictors should be separately stored. The series codes to prepare the required data are provided in this tutorial (see details in Tutorial 1). After preparing the data, run the function “xgb.cv()” to get an initial prediction model. Then, run the function “dplyr::summarise()” to extract the tuned parameter, i.e., the number of trees. Finally, run the function “xgboost()” to train the data, and “predict()” to extract the predicted agent.# 3.  Predict and evaluate the agenta.  Prepare the training and testing data—When the agent model is fitted, it is better to check its prediction performance. Note that the pseudo-dynamic network is sensitive to the values of agent, and the agent with good prediction for the disease risk is preferred. To evaluate its predictive performance, we consider the metric of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). To avoid the overfitting issue, we need a testing data set. For illustration purposes, we artificially created training and testing data by randomly splitting the original data, with no overlap between the two constructed data sets. The training data is used for data fitting, whereas the testing data is used for prediction evaluation. Run the function “sample()” to generate these two datasets. In real applications, another way to validate prediction performance is to use identical but independently sampled data from an external source as the testing set.b. Generate the AUC-ROC plot—After fitting the model based on the training data, by running the function sqrtglm()^° , extract the predicted agent based on the testing data, by running the function “predict()”. Run the function “roc” to generate the plot. A larger AUC-ROC value indicates a better prediction model.# B.  Train the network model (Tutorial 2 in the GitHub repository)1.  Prepare the data for training the network a.  Filtering and transformation—To construct the gene–gene network, the users need to preprocess the gene expression data, by normalizing, excluding low-expressed genes, and, if needed, transforming to relieve skewness and reduce variance.b.  Screening—To learn the disease risk-associated network, genes showing changing expression patterns as the agent changes should be included, which is different from association-based network. Two selection procedures can be considered: i.  To test differentially expressed genes, run the function “test_screen()” to locate genes showing the difference between disease groups, after adjusting for covariates and applying the Hochberg multiple test correction (adjusted P-value <0.05 ). ii.  To screen the genes, run the function “spearman_screen()” to find genes showing high associations between expression and the predicted agent. Pick the top (e.g., top 40) most correlated genes. Perform separate screening to check if more than one homogeneous group is considered. Determine the final genes by combining the two selection procedures. iii.  Optional screening can be done based on prior biological knowledge (i.e., the GO enrichment analysis).2.  Train the varying coefficient modela.  Refine the data—Before constructing the network, each selected gene should be fitted by the varying coefficient model. This model estimates dynamic features of coefficients in terms of a certain agent by Kernel/Spline regression, which fits the context of reconstructing pseudo-dynamic networks well. We refer readers to Chen et al. (2022) for more technical details. When two subjects have the same agent value, it means the expression data from these two are not informative. Run the R codes in this tutorial to refine the data, by deleting the data with agents too close to each other.b.  Fit the model—After refining the data, run the function “vc.fit()” to fit the varying coefficient model with a covariate (e.g., smoking).c.  Check the fitted curves—Run the function “plot()” and “lines()” to check how well the data is fitted. The users can also use the package “ggplot2” for visualization.# 3.  Generate a base matrix for the network modela.  The base matrix is the key component for the network to learn in a non-parametric manner. Run the function “base.construct()” to construct the base matrix for the varying intercept and base matrices for the varying coefficient of the covariate (e.g., smoking). The default knots are lower quartile and upper quartile with degree ^=3 , which is related to the cubic spline.b.  The output—A list of four matrices based on varying intercepts (X_big), varying covariate effects (X_big_cov), varying intercepts with a column containing ones (X_big_int), and varying covariates with a column containing ones (X_big_int_cov).4.  Train the networka.  After constructing the base matrices, the users should run the function “network.learn()” to train the network structure. This function requires the input of the design matrix, the outcome, and the group information, as well as the method to select the tuning parameters. The design matrix—Extract the output results from the previous step of construction of base matrices, which includes i.  data_observe: the gene expression matrix. ii.  x_cov: the vector including the numerical values of the covariate of interest (e.g., smoking: 0 and 1). iii.  X_big_int: the matrix based on varying intercepts, with a column containing ones. iv.  X_big_int_cov: the matrix based on varying coefficients, with a column containing ones. v.  Agent: the predicted disease risk obtained from Tutorial 1.b. Determine the tuning parameters—Multiple methods are available to tune the hyperparameters, including 5-fold CV (CV5), 10-fold CV (CV10), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and empirical BIC (EBIC). Use the argument “cv” in the function “network.learn()” to specify the preferred method.c. Output from the network learning—This output includes information on node size, interaction, and covariate effect. All of them will be used in the next step for visualizing the results. i.  Node size information: self-node size for baseline, self-node size for the covariate effect, overall self-node size.ii.  Interaction information: gene interaction effects from the baseline, gene interaction effects from the covariate, overall gene interaction effects.iii.  Covariate effect information: covariate effect, trend effect for baseline, trend effect from the covariate.# C. Visualize the results (Tutorial 3 in the GitHub repository)1.  Extract the results from the trained network model Read the output data from the network learning in Tutorial 2, which includes network.output, data.list.t3, and gene.names.2.  Visualize the networks with a given range of agent values a.  Baseline networks—To visualize the pseudo-dynamic network given an agent (disease risk) value, one useful tool is the package “igraph”. It allows for a self-designed network structure. More details about “igraph” can be found in the tutorial (https://igraph.org/r/). Run the demo code to visualize the recovered baseline network (e.g., the non-smoking group), where the agent is changing from no risk to high risk. b. Covariate-effect networks—Run the demo code for visualizing three recovered covariate-effect (e.g., effect caused by smoking) networks, where the agent is changing from no risk to low/moderate/high risk (data-driven or subjective cut-points selected for risk levels).3.  Visualize the interaction behaviors for a given gene over the spectrum of the agent Select one specific gene of interest, and run the demo code to plot the trend effect and interaction effects over the whole spectrum of the agent.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Predict the Agent\n## Prepare Data for Training Prediction Values of the Agent\nPrepare the data for model training, which should be a matrix including the outcome in the first column and all potential predictors in the remaining columns.\nEnsure all values in the matrix are numeric and missing data is allowed in this training process.\n## Select a Training Method\nChoose from conventional logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost for predicting the agent.\n## Logistic Regression\nRun the function ddotglm() in R to fit the training model.\nRun the function fitted() to extract the predicted agent.\n## Random Forest\nPrepare the data in a matrix form with the outcome as a factor.\nRun the function ranger() to train the model.\nRun the function predict() to extract the predicted agent.\n## XGBoost\nPrepare the required data with response and predictors separately stored.\nRun the function xgb.cv() to get an initial prediction model.\nRun the function dplyr::summarise() to extract the tuned parameter.\nRun the function xgboost() to train the data and predict() to extract the predicted agent.\n## Predict and Evaluate the Agent\nPrepare training and testing data by splitting the original data.\nGenerate the AUC-ROC plot to evaluate the predictive performance of the model.\n## Train the Network Model\n## Prepare Data for Training the Network\nFilter and transform the gene expression data.\nScreen genes showing changing expression patterns as the agent changes.\n## Train the Varying Coefficient Model\nRefine the data by deleting agents too close to each other.\nFit the varying coefficient model with a covariate.\nCheck the fitted curves using the function plot() and lines().\n## Generate a Base Matrix for the Network Model\nConstruct the base matrix for the varying intercept and base matrices for the varying coefficient of the covariate.\nOutput a list of four matrices based on varying intercepts and covariate effects.\n## Train the Network\nRun the function network.learn() to train the network structure.\nDetermine the tuning parameters using methods such as 5-fold CV, 10-fold CV, AIC, BIC, or EBIC.\nOutput includes node size information, interaction information, and covariate effect information.\n## Visualize the Results\n## Extract Results from the Trained Network Model\nRead the output data from the network learning.\nExtract network.output, data.list.t3, and gene.names.\n## Visualize the Networks with a Given Range of Agent Values\nVisualize the recovered baseline network using the package igraph.\nVisualize the recovered covariate-effect networks.\n## Visualize the Interaction Behaviors for a Given Gene\nSelect one specific gene of interest.\nPlot the trend effect and interaction effects over the whole spectrum of the agent.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Bioinformatics Methods"}}

Rodent-based preclinical animal models are often ill-suited for predicting immunotherapymediated adverse events in humans, in part because of the fundamental differences in immunological responses between species and the human relevant expression profile of the target antigen, if it is expected to be present in normal, healthy tissue. While human-relevant cell-based models of tissues and organs promise to bridge this gap, conventional in vitro two-dimensional models fail to provide the complexity required to model the biological mechanisms of immunotherapeutic effects. Also, like animal models, they fail to recapitulate physiologically relevant levels and patterns of organ-specific proteins, crucial for capturing pharmacology and safety liabilities. Organ-on-Chip models aim to overcome these limitations by combining micro-engineering with cultured primary human cells to recreate the complex multifactorial microenvironment and functions of native tissues and organs. In this protocol, we show the unprecedented capability of two human Organs-on-Chip models to evaluate the safety profile of T cell–bispecific antibodies (TCBs) targeting tumor antigens. These novel tools broaden the research options available for a mechanistic understanding of engineered therapeutic antibodies and for assessing safety in tissues susceptible to adverse events.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Organ-Chip materials\n\n1.

Experimental timeline for the culture of the human Alveolar Lung-Chip# A. Isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)Note: Please refer to the Notes section below for a further discussion on why PBMCs are the recommended cell source used for the TCB-mediated T cell activation and killing assessment. Refer to Alveolar Lung-Chip experimental timeline (Figure 2).1.  Prepare PBMC culture media (see Recipes).2.  Isolate PBMCs from fresh human buffy coat using the direct human PBMC isolation kit following manufacturer’s instructions.3. Approximately 10 million viable PBMCs per chip will be needed to complete the T cell activation and killing assessment.4.  Cryo-preserve PBMC in FBS supplemented with 10% DMSO.# B. Thawing human primary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEC) (Day -1)1.  Heat 50mL of complete SAGM culture medium to 37 ^°C .2.  Coat a T-25 flask with gelatin solution by adding 3mL of 0.1% gelatin solution.3. Incubate the flask at 37 ^°C and 5%CO_2 for 5-10min .4.  Thaw the vial(s) of cells by immersing in a 37 ^°C water bath.5. Immediately transfer the contents of the vial into 3mL of warm complete SAGM in a sterile 15mL conicaltube.6. Rinse the vial with 1~mL of complete SAGM and collect in the 15mL tube.7. Bring the volume to 15mL with complete SAGM culture medium.8. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5min at room temperature.9.  Aspirate and discard supernatant, leaving approximately 100~uL of medium covering the cell pellet.10. Resuspend cells in 7mL of complete SAGM culture medium.11. Add the HPAEC suspension to the T-25 flask.12. Incubate overnight at 37 ^°C and 5%CO_2 .13. Exchange with freshly warm complete SAGM once a day until use for seeding in the chip.# C. Thawing human lung microvascular endothelial cells, HMVEC-L (Day -1)1.  Heat 50mL of complete EGM-2MV culture medium to 37 ^°C .2.  Thaw the vial(s) of cells by immersing in a 37 ^°C water bath.3.  Immediately transfer the contents of the vial into 3~mL of warm complete EGM2-MV culture medium ina sterile 15mL conical tube.4. Rinse the vial with 1~mL of complete EGM-2MV culture medium and collect in the 15mL tube.5. Bring the volume to 15mL with complete EGM2-MV culture medium.6. Add the HMVEC-L suspension to the T75 flask.7. Incubate for ^6h (until 60%-80% cells have adhered) at 37^°C and 5%CO_2 .8. Aspirate the culture medium and add complete EGM-2MV culture medium to remove traces of DMSO.9.  Incubate overnight at 37 ^°C and 5%CO_2 .10. Exchange with freshly warm complete EGM-2MV culture medium every other day until use for seedingin the chip.# D. Chip activation and preparation (Day -1)1.  Review Video 1: Chip activation.()Video 1. Chip activation2. Open the chip cradle sterile packaging and place the cradle into the 120mm square dish, making sure the chip cradle is oriented properly with the corners facing up.3. Open the chip packaging carefully and place the first chip into the chip cradle by sliding the back of the carrier under the tabs on the cradle.4. Prepare the ER-1 solution (see Recipes) Note: All solutions in these steps are used at room temperature.5. Using a P200 pipette and a sterile 200~uL filtered pipette tip, take up 200~uL of ER-1 solution. Note: 200 μL of ER-1 solution will fill approximately three chips. Also, filtered tips help to maintain sterile conditions during chip preparation steps.6. Carefully introduce approximately 20uL of ER-1 solution through the bottom channel inlet, pipetting until the solution begins to exit the bottom channel outlet.7. Without releasing the pipetting plunger, take the pipette out from the bottom channel inlet and move the pipette containing the remaining ER-1 solution to the top channel inlet.8. Introduce approximately 50uL of ER-1 solution to the top channel inlet, pipetting until the solution begins to exit the top channel outlet.9.  Remove all excess ER-1 solution from the surface of the chip by gentle aspiration. Be sure only to remove ER-1 solution from the chip surface—do not aspirate ER-1 from the channels.10. Repeat steps D1–D5 for each chip.11. Inspect the channels for bubbles prior to UV activation. If bubbles are present, dislodge by washing the channel with ER-1 solution until all bubbles have been removed. If bubbles persist, it may be helpful to aspirate the channel dry and slowly reintroduce ER-1 solution.12. Bring the ER-1-coated chips to the UV light box.13. Before placing the chips into the UV light box, make sure to remove the cover from the 120 mm square dish. Note: If the cover is not removed prior to placing the dish in the UV light box, the chips will not activate properly, which could result in poor cell attachment.14. Set the switch at the back of the UV light box to the “Constant” setting. Turn on the “Power” and press the “On” button to begin UV activation.15. Allow the chips to activate under UV light for 10min .16. After UV treatment, bring the chips back to the biosafety cabinet (BSC).17. Aspirate activated ER-1 from all channels and refill channels with fresh ER-1 as before.18. Bring the chips back to the UV light box and activate under UV light for an additional 5min .19. While the chips are being treated, prepare the top and bottom channel alveolus ECM working solution (see Recipes).20. After UV treatment, bring chips back to the BSC.Note: The light may be on in the BSC from this point forward.21. Fully aspirate the ER-1 solution from both channels for approximately 1–2 s.22. Wash each channel with 200~uL of ER-2 solution.23. Fully aspirate the ER-2 from the channels for approximately 1-2~s~24. Wash each channel with 200~uL of sterile DPBS.25. Leave DPBS inside the channels.# E. Chip coating with ECM (Day -1)1.  Review Video 2. Activation and coating of chips with extracellular matrix proteins.()# Video 2. Activation and coating of chips with extracellular matrix proteins2.  Fully aspirate cold DPBS from both channels.3. Using a P200 pipette, take up 200~uL of alveolus or colon ECM working solution.4. Carefully introduce alveolus or colon ECM working solution through the bottom channel inlet until a small ECM droplet forms on the outlet.5. Without releasing the pipetting plunger, take the pipette out from the bottom channel inlet and move to the next chip, repeating steps E2–E4 for each chip.6. Using a P200 pipette, take up 200~uL alveolus or colon ECM working solution.7. Carefully introduce alveolus or colon ECM working solution through the top channel inlet until a small ECM droplet forms on the outlet.8. Without releasing the pipetting plunger, take the pipette out from the top channel inlet and move to the next chip, repeating steps E5–E7 for each chip.9.  Inspect channels to ensure that no bubbles are present. If bubbles are present, dislodge by washing the channel with the respective top or bottom channel ECM solutions until all bubbles have been removed.10. To prevent evaporation during incubation, fill central reservoir of the chip cradle with 0.75~mL of DPBS (Figure 3), place the lid onto a 120mm square dish, and incubate overnight at 37 ^°C and 5%CO_2 . Note for Alveolar Lung-Chip: If desired, HPAEC can be seeded the same day as chip activation and ECM coating, though incubation overnight is preferred for best result. Chips can be ready for same-day seeding of HPAEC 4 h after adding the ECM solutions and incubating chips at 37^°C and 5%C O_2 If chips will be stored longer than overnight before seeding, store the chips at 4 ^°C_. for up to two days.()Figure 3. Fill central reservoir of chip cradle# F.  Prepare chips for seeding (Day 0)1.  Gently wash each channel of the chip with 200~uL of warm complete SAGM culture medium.2. Aspirate the medium outflow at the surface of the chips, leaving the medium in the channels.3. Repeat the wash with an additional 200~uL of complete SAGM culture medium per channel, leaving theexcess medium outflow covering the inlet and outlet ports.4.  Cover the 120mm dish and place the chips in the incubator until the cells are ready for seeding.# G. Harvest of HPAECs (Day 0)1.  Bring the T-25 flask containing HPAECs from the incubator into the BSC.2. Aspirate culture media from a T-25 flask of confluent HPAECs.3. Add 5mL of DPBS preincubated to 37^°C to wash the culture surface and aspirate the DPBS wash.4. Add 3mL of TrypLE Express to the flask and incubate for 10-15 min at 37^°C and 5%CO_2 .5. Tap the side of the flask gently and inspect the culture under the microscope to assess complete detachment of cells from the flask surface.6. Add 7mL of warm complete SAGM culture medium to the flask and pipette gently to mix, while collecting all cells from the flask surface.7. Transfer the contents of the flask into a sterile 15mL conical tube.8.  Centrifuge HPAECs at 200× g for 5min at room temperature.9.  Carefully aspirate the supernatant, leaving approximately 100~uL of medium above the cell pellet. Note: The cell pellet will be very small. Aspirate carefully.10. Loosen the cell pellet by flicking the tube gently.11. Using a P1000 pipette, gently resuspend the cells by adding 500~uL of warm complete SAGM culture medium.12. Pipette gently to create a homogeneous mixture and transfer 10~uL of the cell suspension to the cell counting solution of 80~uL SAGM culture medium +~10~uL trypan blue, making a 1:10 dilution.13. Mix the counting solution thoroughly and count cells using a manual hemocytometer.14. Count both viable and non-viable cells.15. Calculate percent viability of the cell solution.16. The expected viability of the HPAECs should be greater than 80% .17. Calculate viable cell concentration.18. Calculate viable cell yield, or total number of viable cells.19. Dilute with warm complete SAGM culture medium to the required final cell density of 1×10^6 cells/mL viable HPAECs.# H. Seed HPAECs to top channel (Day 0)1.  Bring the 120mm dish containing the prepared chips to the BSC.2.  Avoiding contact with the inlet and outlet ports, carefully aspirate excess medium droplets from the surface of one chip.3. Very gently agitate cell suspension before seeding each chip to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension.4. Quickly and steadily pipette 35-50~uL of the cell suspension (at 1×10^6cells/mL_ ) into the top channel inlet port, while aspirating the outflow fluid from the chip surface. Avoid direct contact with the outlet port.5.  Cover the dish and transfer to the microscope to check the seeding density within the chip. Note: At this stage, optimal seeding density should form an even layer with cell-to-cell spacing of approximately half the radius of a single cell.6.  If seeding density is not optimal, return the chips to the BSC and wash the channel with 200~uL of fresh medium twice. Adjust cell density accordingly and repeat steps H3–H5 until the correct density is achieved within the channel.7.  After confirming the correct cell density, seed cells in the remaining chips. Note: Minimize the amount of time the cells are outside the incubator by seeding no more than six chips at a time and immediately placing them in the incubator at 37~^°C after seeding each batch.8.  Place the chips with DPBS in the central reservoir of the chip cradle (Figure 3) at 37 ^°C for at least 2h or until cells have attached (Figure 4). Note: Correct seeding density is essential for success of Alveolar-Lung Chips.()Figure 4. Representative brightfield images of epithelial (HPAEC) cell seeding density. (A) Optimal seeding density immediately after seeding and (B) 2h post-seeding at 1×10^6 per mL.# I.  Wash chips (Days 1 and 2)Note: A gentle wash is performed 2 h post-seeding once the cells have attached, to ensure that nutrients are replenished and the channels do not dry out. If cells are not attached, incubate overnight and then wash.1.  Gently pipette 200~uL of warm complete SAGM culture medium to the top and bottom channels of each chip to wash. Aspirate the outflow, leaving media in the channel.2. Place additional droplets of media to fully cover all inlet and outlet ports to prevent evaporation from the ports (Figure 5).3. Incubate chips overnight at 37^°C .4.  Repeat steps I2 and I3 once daily with HPAEC maintenance media (see Recipes) for the next two days.()Figure 5. Chip with medium drops covering the inlet and outlet ports# J.  Prepare chips (Day 3)1.  Gently pipette 200~uL of warm HPAEC maintenance medium to the top channel of each chip to wash. Aspirate the outflow, leaving medium in the channel.2. Pipette 200uL of warm complete EGM-2MV culture medium to the bottom channel of each chip. Aspirate the outflow, leaving medium in the channel.3.  Return chips to the incubator until HMVEC-Ls are ready for seeding.# K. Harvest HMVEC-Ls (Day 3)1.  Aspirate culture medium and add 15mL of 1×DPBS to wash the culture surface. Aspirate the DPBS wash.2.  Add 5mL of TrypLE Express to the flask. Incubate for 5-10 min at 37 ^°C .3.  Tap the side of the flask gently and inspect the culture under the microscope to assess complete detachment of cells from the culture surface.4.  Add 7~mL of warm complete EGM-2MV culture medium to the flask and pipette gently to mix, while collecting all cells from the culture surface.5. Transfer the contents of the flask ( 12mL ) into a sterile 15mL conical tube.6.  Centrifuge HMVEC-Ls at 200× g for 5min at room temperature.7.  Carefully aspirate the supernatant, leaving approximately 50-100~uL of medium above the cell pellet. Note: The cell pellet will be small. Aspirate carefully.8.  Loosen the cell pellet by flicking the tube gently.9.  Using a P1000 pipette, gently resuspend the cells by adding 500 uL of complete EGM-2MV culture medium.10. Pipette gently to create a homogeneous mixture and transfer 10~uL of the cell suspension to the cell counting solution of 80~uL SAGM and 10~uL trypan blue (this will make a 1:10 dilution).11. Mix the counting solution thoroughly and count cells using a manual hemocytometer.12. Count both viable and non-viable cells.13. Calculate percent viability of the cell solution.14. The expected viability of the HMVEC-Ls should be greater than 80% .15. Calculate viable cell concentration.16. Calculate viable cell yield.17. Dilute to 5×10^6 cells/mL viable HMVEC-Ls in complete EGM-2MV culture medium.# L. Seed HMVEC-Ls to bottom channel (Day 3)1.  Bring the 120mm dish containing the prepared chips to the BSC.2.  Avoiding contact with the ports, aspirate DPBS from cradle reservoir and carefully aspirate excess medium droplets from the surface of one chip.3. Gently agitate cell suspension before seeding each chip to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension.4.  Seed 15-20uL of the endothelial cell suspension into the bottom channel of one chip first, while aspirating the outflow.5.  Cover the dish and transfer to the microscope to check the seeding density within the chip (see Figure 6 for reference).()Figure 6. Endothelial (HMVEC-L) optimum cell seeding density. (A) Optimal seeding density under brightfield microscopy, immediately after seeding into the bottom channel at 5×10^6 per mL. (B) HMVEC-Ls attached on chip 1.5 h post-seeding.6.  If seeding density is not optimal, return the chip to the BSC and wash the channel twice with 200~uL of fresh endothelial cell culture medium. Do not aspirate the medium from the channel prior to washing. Adjust the volume of the cell suspension as needed to obtain correct seeding density and repeat steps L3- L5 until the correct density is achieved within the channel.7.  After confirming the correct cell density, seed the remaining chips in the chip cradle. Note: Minimize the amount of time the cells are outside the incubator by seeding no more than six chips at a time and immediately placing them in the incubator at 37~^°C after seeding.8.  Once all six chips have been seeded place each in the cradle, cover the dish and carefully invert it (Figure 7).()# Figure 7. Inverting chips during endothelial attachment9.  To prevent evaporation during incubation, refill central reservoir with 0.75~mL of DPBS and place cover onto square dish.10. Proceed with remaining chips until all have been seeded.11. Incubate at 37 ^°C for 2h , or until cells in the bottom channel have attached.12. Once endothelial cells have attached (approximately 2~h post-seeding), aspirate DPBS from the central reservoir and flip the dish back so the chips are in an upright position in the chip cradle. Note: It is recommended to always seed any remaining cells into a plate as control for cell quality.# M. Wash with tips (Day 3)1.  Once HMVEC-Ls have attached, flip the chips back to an upright position. Note: Remove the chip cradle, wipe with 70% ethanol to clean, and autoclave for use in next experiment.2.  A wash with 200uL of HPAEC maintenance medium for the top channel and complete EGM-2MV culture medium for the bottom channel per chip will provide nutrients to cells. Since there are two different media being used, these must be separated by keeping them in filtered tips instead of drops (Figure 8).()# Figure 85. Chip with filtered tips inserted into ports with respective media3.  Return chips with pipette tips inserted in each inlet and outlet port to the incubator overnight.4.  Maintain cells in static culture in chips until connecting to pods and Zoë the next day. Note: If desired, chips can be connected at least 2 h post-attachment.# N. Gas equilibration of media (Day 4)Note: The media equilibration step is important for the success of Organ-Chip culture. Omission of this step will cause the eventual formation of bubbles in the chip, the pod, or both, which will in turn cause irregular flow and negatively impact cell viability. Minimize the time media is outside of a warmed environment to no more than 10 min, as gas equilibrium can become compromised when media is allowed to cool.1.  Place at least 3mL of HPAEC maintenance medium for each chip in a 50mL conical tube.2.  Place at least 3mL of complete EGM-2MV culture medium for each chip in a separate 50mL conical tube.3.  Heat both 50mL conical tubes of media at 37 ^°C in a water or bead bath for at least 1h .4. Immediately connect the 50mL tube containing each warmed medium to a Steriflip® unit.5. Attach each conical tube containing warmed medium to a Steriflip® unit.6. With the unit right-side up (medium in the bottom conical tube), apply vacuum for 10s .7.  Invert the Steriflip®-connected tubes and check that the medium begins to pass from the top conical tube to the lower tube. Note: The vacuum source must operate at least at -70 kPa. At this correct pressure, it should take approximately 2 s for every 10 mL of medium to flow through the filter. If it takes longer, stop and see the troubleshooting protocol, as this indicates the medium is not equilibrated properly.8.  Leave the filtered medium under vacuum for 5min .9.  Remove the vacuum tubing from the Steriflip® units.10. Separate the conical tubes containing media from the Steriflip® unit and immediately place them in the incubator with the caps loose.# O. Media priming of pods (Day 4)1.  Open the pod package and place the pods into the trays. Orient the pods with the reservoirs toward the back of the tray (Figure 9A).2.  Pipette 2~mL of pre-equilibrated warm media to each inlet reservoir. In the top channel inlet reservoir add HPAEC maintenance medium; in the bottom channel inlet reservoir add complete EGM-2MV culture medium (Figure 9C).3. Pipette 300uL of pre-equilibrated warm media to each outlet reservoir, directly over each outlet via (Figure 9C).4. Bring trays containing pods to the incubator and slide completely into Zoë with the tray handle facing outward.5.  Run the prime cycle on Zoë.6. Use the rotary dial to highlight “Prime” on the display.7.  Press the rotary dial to select “Prime.”8.  Rotate the dial clockwise to highlight “Start.”9.  Press the dial again to select “Start” and begin. Note: Once “Start” is selected, there will be an audible sound as Zoë engages the pods.10. Close the incubator door and allow Zoë to prime the pods; this process takes approximately 1 min. Note: When the status bar reads “Ready,” the “Prime” cycle is complete.11. Remove the tray from Zoë and bring to the BSC.12. Verify that the pods were successfully primed (Figure 9B). This is important for success.13. Inspect the underside of each pod—look for the presence of small droplets at all four fluidic ports. Droplets will vary in size from a small meniscus to larger droplets; often, droplets on the outlet ports will be larger.14. If any pod does not show droplets, rerun the “Prime” cycle on those Pods.15. If any media dripped onto the tray (this may occur more often by the outlet ports), clean tray with a wipe sprayed with 70% ethanol.16. Once it is confirmed that all pod ports are wet with droplets, put the tray of pods to the side in the BSC.()Figure 9. 6Illustration of chip & pod handling. (A) Illustration of chip tray and pods. (B) Illustration demonstrating pod handling and description of the visual inspection necessary to observe droplet formation after priming step. (C) Schematic representation of the pod reservoirs indicating the respective top and bottom channels and inlet and outlet ports.# P.  Wash chips (Day 4)1.  Transfer the seeded chips in a 150mm dish from the incubator to the BSC.2.  Remove the pipette tips from the chip inlet and outlet ports.3. Gently wash the top channel of each chip with warm equilibrated HPAEC maintenance medium to remove any possible bubbles in the channel.4. Place small droplets of equilibrated HPAEC maintenance medium on the top of each top channel inlet and outlet port of each chip.5. Gently wash the bottom channel of each chip with warm equilibrated complete EGM-2MV culture medium to remove any possible bubbles in the channel.6. Place small droplets of equilibrated complete EGM-2MV culture medium on the top of each bottom channel inlet and outlet ports of each chip.# Q. Chips-to-Pods (Day 4)1.  Holding one chip (while it remains in the chip carrier) with the dominant hand and one pod with the nondominant hand, slide the chip carrier into the tracks on the underside of the pod until the chip carrier has seated fully.2.  Place the thumb on the chip carrier tab and gently but firmly depress the tab in and up to engage the tab of the chip carrier with the pod.3. Aspirate any excess medium on the chip surface from the pod window.4. Place the pod with the connected chip onto the tray.5. Repeat steps Q1–Q4 for each pod and chip carrier.6. Confirm that there is sufficient media in each pod inlet and outlet reservoirs and that the pod lids are flat and secure.# R. Pods-to-Zoë (Day 4)1.  Place trays that are holding pods and chips immediately into Zoë to prevent media from cooling and losing its gas equilibration.2. Set top channel flow rate to 0uL/h and bottom channel flow rate to 30uL/h .3. Run the regulate cycle.4. Using the rotary dial, highlight the “Regulate” field.5. Press the dial to select “Regulate” and rotate the dial clockwise to “Start.”6. Press the dial again to select “Start” and begin the regulate cycle. Note: Once “Start” is selected, there will be an audible sound as Zoë engages the pods.7. At this point the “Activation” button will glow blue.8. The regulate cycle lasts 2~h . After the cycle has finished, Zoë will begin flow at the preset Organ-Chip culture conditions. To cancel the regulate cycle (only if needed) on Zoë, select the “Regulate” field with the dial and press the button to select. Rotate the dial counterclockwise to select “Cancel.” Press the dial once more and wait 1 min for the cycle to end, after which the tray can be removed. If canceled, always rerun a complete regulate cycle before proceeding.# S.  Via wash and the regulate cycle (Day 5)1.  Review Video 3: Pod priming and regulate cycle.2.  The day after connecting chips and pods to Zoë, which begins the process of Organ-Chip culture, pause the Zoë by pressing the silver “Activation” button located above the tray bays. This stops flow and releases the pods.3. Slide the tray out of the bay and transfer to the BSC.4.  Remove the pod lids. Using a 200~uL pipette, perform a via wash on each pod inlet and outlet reservoir: a. Using media within the pod reservoir, pipette 200~uL of media directly over the top of the via to dislodge any bubbles that may be present. b.  Repeat this wash step for each of the four pod reservoirs. c.  Replace pod lids and return the trays to Zoddote .()Video 3. Pod priming and regulate cycle# T. Establishing air–liquid interface (ALI) and maintenance (Day 5)Note: Only establish ALI 12 or more hours after running regulate. Do not rerun regulate cycle once ALI is established.1.  Pause Zoë by pressing the silver “Activation” button and move pods into the BSC.2.  Using a complete aspiration technique, aspirate all media from both inlet and outlet reservoirs along all four edges of the reservoir for the top channel for all pods that require culture at ALI. Transfer all trays and pods back into Zoë.3.  Set top channel flow rate to 1,000~uL/h and bottom channel to 0~uL/h . Start flow and allow to run for 1 min. This step gently pushes any remaining media from the top channel and collects it in the top channel outlet reservoir.4. Pause Zoë as previously described and move pods into the BSC. Immediately aspirate all remaining media from top channel outlet reservoir to avoid media backflow from the outlet reservoir into the channel.5. Using the microscope, check to confirm that the top channel does not contain medium.6. If channels are not completely free of medium, place back in Zoë and run for another 1min at 1,000uL/h .7. Aspirate all medium from bottom channel inlet and outlet reservoirs, leaving a small liquid layer over the bottom inlet reservoir via. This will prevent introducing unwanted bubbles during flow.8.  Add 2-4~mL of warm ALI culture medium to the bottom channel inlet reservoirs.9.  Pipette 1~mL of media in the air channel pod inlet reservoir first, then immediately pipette 1~mL of media in the air channel pod outlet reservoir. Note: This equal media distribution in the pod reservoirs is required to maintain static pressure in the air channel.10. Transfer all trays and pods back to Zoë.11. Set top channel to “Air.”12. Set bottom channel flow rate to 30uL/h .13. Press the activation button to resume Zoë operation.14. Refresh medium in bottom channel inlet reservoir every other day or as needed.# U. Sampling and media replenishment (Day ^6+. )1. Pause Zoë by pressing the silver “Activation” button.2. Remove the trays and place in the BSC.3. Visually inspect each chip for bubbles.4. Using a microscope, inspect cells in the chips to assess morphology and viability. Capture representativeimages at 10× or 20× magnification at the following locations (Figure 10):a.  Inlet junction. b.  Center of channel. c.  Outlet junction. 5.  Remove the pod lids and collect effluent medium from pod outlet reservoirs for analysis. Collect effluent from the indicated regions, avoiding disturbing the pod reservoir vias. 6. Gently aspirate any medium not collected for analysis, ensuring that a thin liquid film still covers the reservoir vias so that no air is introduced into the vias. 7. Refill the pod media reservoirs with fresh complete ALI medium and perform a via wash: using medium within the pod reservoir, pipette 1~mL of medium directly over the top of the via to dislodge any bubbles that may be present. 8. Replace the pod lids and return trays to Zoë. 9. Press the silver “Activation” button to resume pre-set Organ-Chip culture conditions. 10. Zoë will engage when the “Activation” button glows blue.()Figure 710. Representative schematic of image collection performed on chip. (A) Image capture of regions along the length of the chip. (B) Representative images of colonic epithelial cells and human microvascular endothelial cells seeded in the top and bottom chip channels, respectively.# V. Pre-dosing media condition change and PBMC thawing (Day 8)1.  Aspirate media from bottom channel inlet and outlet reservoirs.2. Replace bottom channel media with ALI culture medium without hydrocortisone.Note: Hydrocortisone is an immunosuppressant and needs to be removed a day before dosing.3.  Check for bubbles in the channel and vias, following standard troubleshooting procedures.4.  Maintain ALI setting.# W. PBMC thawing protocol (Day 8)1.  Heat PBMC culture medium to 37 ^°C in a water bath.2.  Thaw frozen vials, only three vials at a time, in a 37~^°C water bath. When cells are nearly completely thawed, carry the vials to the hood and swipe them with 70% ethanol.3.  Take out PBMCs (by very slow and gentle pipetting) and transfer the cells into a 50mL Falcon tube.4.  Dilution of DMSO: add 10mL of warm complete medium dropwise, i.e., one drop per second, while gently mixing the cells. Use 1~mL to rinse out the vials.5. Wash 1: spin the cells at 300× g for 8min at room temperature. Remove supernatant by tube inversion.6. Wash 2: suspend the cell pellet in 1~mL of medium and add 9mL of complete medium. Spin the cells at 300× g for 8 min at room temperature.7.  Count cells and determine viability: add 1~mL of complete medium, slowly suspend the cell pellet using the 1~mL pipette, and add more medium to a cell concentration of approximately 3×10^6–4×10^6 cells/mL (e.g., if the vial contained 20×10^6 fresh cells, add approximately 4~mL of medium since cell loss is expected after thawing). Perform the counting on 10~uL aliquots in duplicate with ^1/_2 trypan blue dilution. Just prior to pipetting out the cells for counting, gently invert the tube in order to homogenize the cell suspension.8.  Resting: adjust cell concentration to 2×10^6 cells/mL in complete medium, transfer cells in a 25 or 75cm^2 flask, and let them rest for 4-16h before performing the experiments. The flask should be kept standing or slightly bended, not flat in the incubator.# X. PBMC staining for live imaging (Day 9)1.  Transfer the PBMCs from the flask to a 50mL conical tube and centrifuge at 300× g for 8min .2.  Resuspend the PBMC pellet with 10mL of RPMI+5% FBS and count the cell suspension.3.

PBMC pretreatment with TCBs (Day 9)1.  Resuspend PBMC cells with PBMC dosing medium (see Recipes) at a working concentration of 8×10^6 cells/mL, or 2-fold higher than the final PBMC density.2. Prepare TCBs in PBMC dosing media at working concentrations 2-fold higher than the final concentration specified in the experimental design.3.  Combine the 2-fold working concentrations of PBMCs with the corresponding TCBs.4.  Preincubate the dosing suspension for 1h at 37 ^°C and 5%CO_2 .# Z.  Reintroduction of liquid–liquid interface (LLI) (Day 9)1.  Add 500~uL of complete ALI medium (without hydrocortisone) in the top inlet reservoirs of all chips.2.  Make sure the bottom channel reservoirs have enough media. If not, add complete ALI medium (without hydrocortisone) to the bottom channel inlets.3.  Run a flush cycle to reintroduce liquid–liquid interface: a.  Set top channel flow rate to 1,000uL/h and bottom channel flow rate to 0uL/h . b.  Start flow and allow to run for 2~min . Note: This step gently pushes media to the top channel and collects it in the top channel outlet reservoir. c. Pause Zoë as previously described and move pods into the BSC. Aspirate all media from the top channel outlet reservoir. d.  Use the microscope to confirm that the top channel is submerged with medium.e.  If the top channel is not filled with medium, place back in the Zoë and run for another 1 min at 1,000 uL/h . f.  Repeat steps Z3c–Z3d as needed. 4.  Set bottom and top channel flow rates to 30uL/h and activate the Zoë.AA.  PBMC-TCB introduction to the Alveolus Lung-Chip epithelium (Day 9)1.  Add 500~uL of the PBMC dosing medium to the top channel inlets in appropriate chips.2.  Run a flush cycle for the top channel: a.  Set top channel flow rate to 1,000uL/h and bottom channel flow rate to 0uL/h . b.  Start flow and allow to run for 3min . c.  Pause Zoë as previously described and move pods into the BSC. Aspirate all media from the top channel outlet reservoir.3.  Disconnect the chips from Zoë and check under the microscope, making sure the PBMCs are distributed throughout the top channel (Figure 11). Note: PBMCs might not be evenly distributed throughout the top channel after the flush cycle but will settle down evenly after the static period.4. Place the chips back in the Zoë and leave the top channel static for 2.5h to allow the PBMCs to settle.5. Aspirate top channel inlets and outlets and refresh the top channel inlet reservoir with fresh dosing media.6. Aspirate the bottom channel inlets and outlets and add fresh complete ALI  medium (without hydrocortisone).7. Connect the chips to flow and set the top and bottom channel flow rates to 30uL/h . Note: Record the time of PBMC-TCB dosing and the static incubation time.()Figure 11.8 Representative brightfield micrographs of healthy alveolar epithelial cells on the top channel of the Alveolar Lung-Chip in the absence and presence of well-distributed PBMCs in co-culture# BB.

(B) For each peak, the geometric mean of FITC+ intensity is measured in order to produce the standard curve.# FF. Endpoint fixation with PFANote: Prepare the workspace of the chemical fume hood prior to beginning your work, ensuring that the space within the hood is organized and free from clutter and that the path of airflow is not blocked.1.  Ensure all chip carriers are labeled and identify the different conditions clearly. Detach chips from PodTM modules and organize them in petri dishes for handling.2.  Gently wash each channel with 200~uL of DPBS once.3.  Place 200~uL tips gently in the outlets of both channels. We recommend using filtered tips for this step. Be careful to not push the tips too hard against the bottom of the chip channel, as this could seal off the outlet and prevent reagents from going through the channel and outlet.4. Add 100~uL of 4% PFA (in PBS, pH7.4 ) to each channel from the inlet, leaving the tips inserted into the inlet as shown in Figure 7.5.  Incubate for 20min at room temperature.6.  After incubation, remove all four pipette tips and wash each channel with 200~uL of DPBS three times.7. Optional: Add 200~uL of 100mM glycine to each channel and incubate at room temperature for 30 min PFA tends to increase the sample auto-fluorescence in the green (FITC, 488) wavelength and glycine can be used to quench the autofluorescence.Note: Fixed chips can be stored at 4~^°C for up to one week in DPBS with 0.05% sodium azide. To ensure channels do not dry up during this period, it is recommended that DPBS is added with 200mu L tips as described in steps FF3 and FF4 above. Then, place the chips with tips in the ports inside plastic containers sealed with parafilm. We recommended using empty 200 μL tip boxes for storage. Ensure that the tips remain snug in the ports during transport and storage to avoid drying of the channels.# GG.  Permeabilization and blocking1.  Use PBS to prepare a blocking/permeabilizing solution containing: a. 0.1% Triton X-100 (it is recommended that permeabilization be skipped for surface markers). b. 1% BSA and 5% normal donkey serum (in DPBS) obtained from the same animal where secondaries antibodies have been raised in (species-matched serum).2.  Incubate the samples at room temperature for 30min in the blocking/permeabilizing solution.3.  Wash samples with 200~uL of PBS three times.# HH.  Immunofluorescent staining on fixed samples1.  Prepare primary antibody staining solution(s) in 2% BSA/DPBS or 10% serum/DPBS: a.  Anti-human FOLR1 IgG1 1:50 (v/v). b.  Anti E-cadherin polyclonal rabbit (1:100).2.  After preparing the primary antibody solution(s), add 100~uL to the top and bottom channels, leaving pipette tips inserted in the inlet ports.3. Incubate chips overnight at 4^°C .4. After incubation remove all pipette tips and wash each channel with 200~uL of DPBS three times.5. Prepare secondary antibody solution(s) in 2% (v/v) BSA in DPBS: a.  Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Flour 568. b.  Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 488.6.  Add 100uL of the secondary antibody solution to the top and bottom channels, leaving pipette tips inserted in the ports as described in steps HH3 and HH4. If you are staining just one channel, add DPBS to the opposite channel.7. Incubate chips for 2h at room temperature taking care to protect them from light.8.  After incubation, remove all pipette tips and wash each channel with 200~uL of DPBS three times.9.  Prepare NucBlue solution: 2 drops of NucBlue solution in 1~mL of DPBS to stain cell nuclei. Add 100~uL of this solution and incubate for 10min .10. Wash three times with DPBS.11. Image the samples (Figure 15) or store at 4^°C .()Figure 15.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-575","title":"Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) Assay in Mammalian Cells for Deep, High-Confidence, and High-Throughput Target Deconvolution","text":"Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) Assay in Mammalian Cells for Deep, High-Confidence, and High-Throughput Target Deconvolution\n\n# Abstract\n\nChemical proteomics focuses on the drug–target–phenotype relationship for target deconvolution and elucidation of the mechanism of action—key and bottleneck in drug development and repurposing. Majorly due to the limits of using chemically modified ligands in affinity-based methods, new, unbiased, proteome-wide, and MS-based chemical proteomics approaches have been developed to perform drug target deconvolution, using full proteome profiling and no chemical modification of the studied ligand. Of note among them, thermal proteome profiling (TPP) aims to identify the target(s) by measuring the difference in melting temperatures between each identified protein in drug-treated versus vehicle-treated samples, with the thermodynamic interpretation of “protein melting” and curve fitting of all quantified proteins, at all temperatures, in each biological replicate. Including TPP, all the other chemical proteomics approaches often fail to provide target deconvolution with sufficient proteome depth, statistical power, throughput, and sustainability, which could hardly fulfill the final purpose of drug development. The proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA) assay provides no thermodynamic interpretation, but a throughput 10–100-fold compared to the other proteomics methods, high sustainability, much lower time of analysis and sample amount requirements, high confidence in results, maximal proteome coverage (~10,000 protein IDs), and up to five drugs / test molecules in one assay, with at least biological triplicates of each treatment. Each drug-treated or vehicletreated sample is split into many fractions and exposed to a gradient of heat as solubility perturbing agent before being recomposed into one sample; each soluble fraction is isolated, then deep and quantitative proteomics is applied across all samples. The proteins interacting with the tested molecules (targets and off-targets), the activated mechanistic factors, or proteins modified during the treatment show reproducible changes in their soluble amount compared to vehicle-treated controls. As of today, the maximal multiplexing capability is 18 biological samples per PISA assay, which enables statistical robustness and flexible experimental design accommodation for fuller target deconvolution, including integration of orthogonal chemical proteomics methods in one PISA assay. Living cells for studying target engagement in vivo or, alternatively, protein extracts to identify in vitro ligand-interacting proteins can be studied, and the minimal need in sample amount unlocks target deconvolution using primary cells and their derived cultures.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Cell culture\n\n1.

Thaw the cells to be studied from the Nu_2 stock vials, and wash them in 10-15~mL of their regular cell culture medium (e.g., DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine), and sediment cells down by centrifugation according to cell type-specific recommendations 250× g for 5:min ). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in complete growth medium.2.  The day before the PISA experiment, split the cells in the number of samples as by experimental design, up to 18-25-cm^2 cell culture flasks containing 5mL of complete cell growth medium in each flask, and let the cells attach overnight.3.  Incubate each biological replicate with active ligands to be studied (e.g., drugs, active molecules of interest)—here named “D”—at a biologically active concentration previously tested (e.g., IC_50 or similar) using a stock with 1,000-2,000× concentration, with at least three biological replicates per D ligand. Control replicates are to be treated with the volume of the vehicle solution (e.g., DMSO). In the chosen example of PISA multiplexing scheme, five D ligands (D1–D5) with three biological replicates each and three replicates of the vehicle-treated controls are used, for a total of 18 biological samples. Note: The number of biological replicates can be higher, as recommended for lower numbers of D ligands to be tested, depending on the number of molecules or conditions to be tested, and up to 18, by using the TMTproTM 18-plex label reagent set, which can host up to five ligand-treated or vehicle-treated samples in triplicate.4.  Incubate treated cells for 30-90 min in a 5% CO_2 cell culture incubator at 37 ^°C .5.  At the end of the treatment with each D or vehicle, collect cells from each flask using TrypLE, and wash the cell pellets twice with 10mL of PBS, followed by centrifugation ( 250× g for 5min ).# B.  Protein extraction for PISA assay samples1.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 750~uL of PBS buffer including protease inhibitors.2.  Gently mix, resuspend cells homogeneously, and distribute 45~uL in each 0.2–mL tube, for a total of 16 temperature points to be used for each sample.3. Perform step B2 for each sample.4. Heat each sample at a range of 44 to 59^°C , with 1 ^°C intervals, and perform the temperature treatment for 3 min at each temperature. Notes: a.  By using a gradient thermal cycler, samples can be treated at different temperatures at the same time. b .  The temperature range can be varied and tuned according to specific expectations or needs, with virtually unlimited number of temperature points.5.  Leave the samples at 23 ^°C for 6min .6.  At the end of the 23 ^°C incubation, snap freeze the samples in liquid Nu_2 .7.  Thaw all samples at 37 ^°C , vortex for 10s. , and snap freeze in liquid Nu_2 .8. Repeat step B7 four times, for a total of five freeze-thaw cycles.9. For each sample and replicate, combine the contents of 16 tubes corresponding to all temperatures of that replicate into one protein low-binding tube, and add 20% NP40 solution, up to a final concentration of 0.4% , which at this point should not resolubilize insoluble proteins.10. Incubate all samples shaking at 350rpm/min at 4^°C , in a thermomixer or a refrigerated room, for 30min .11. Perform ultracentrifugation at 150,000× g at 4^°C for 30min , and recover the supernatant of each replicate without disrupting the pellet.# C. Soluble protein fraction processing# Day 11.  Measure the total protein concentration of all samples, using a micro-BCA kit and an absorbance plate reader.2.  Take the volume corresponding to 50~ug for each sample. To equalize volumes, dilute all samples with PBS up to the volume of the sample with the least concentration. Perform reduction by adding 0.5M DTT solution to a final concentration of 8mM , and incubate samples at 55^°C for 45min .3.  Add 0.5M IAA solution to a final concentration of 25mM , and incubate samples in darkness at 25 ^°C for 30min .4.  Precipitate proteins using cold acetone at -20~^°C overnight, at a sample:acetone ratio of 1:6 (v/v).# Day 25.  Collect the precipitated proteins by centrifugation ( 10,000× g , 10 min ), remove the supernatant, and airdry the pellet for 5min .6. Solubilize each pellet in 15~uL of EPPS buffer at pH8.2 including ^8M urea for 10min .7. Add 14uL of EPPS buffer to each sample. Dissolve 20~ug LysC powder using 30uL of EPPS buffer, then add 1~uL of this LysC enzyme solution (equivalent to 0.67~ug of LysC) to each sample, and allow the digestion to proceed gently mixing at 350rpm/min at 30^°C for ^6h .8. Add 90~uL of EPPS buffer to each sample. Dissolve 20~ug lyophilized sequencing grade modified trypsin using 20~uL of trypsin resuspension buffer, then add 1~uL of this trypsin solution (equivalent to 1~ug of trypsin) to each sample, and let the digestion occur gently mixing at 350rpm/min at 37 ^°C overnight.9.  Stop the reaction the day after by placing the samples on ice.10. Take out a volume of 60uL , corresponding to 25~ug , from each of the digested protein samples. Dissolve 800ug TMTpro 18-plex reagent using 150~uL of water-free acetonitrile, and label each sample with 25uL of a different TMTpro 18-plex labeling reagent solution. Let the labeling reaction occur at room temperature for 2~h . Keep the remaining 25~ug of each sample at -80~^°C as a backup. The remaining TMTpro 18-plex reagent solution can be stored at -80~^°C after speed-vacuum drying.11. Stop the reaction by adding 50% hydroxylamine solution to quench labeling, to a final concentration of 0.5% hydroxylamine.12. Pool the labeled samples together in a 2-m L tube and concentrate the obtained multiplexed sample at least two-fold in a speed-vacuum concentrator.13. Acidify the samples using acidifying solution, to a final concentration of 1% TFA, to reach a final pH< 3.14. Perform desalting of the multiplexed sample using a C-18 desalting column and a vacuum manifold. The sample desalting procedure, in sequence, is as follows: a.  Wash the column with 0.45mL of 100% methanol. b.  Wash with 0.45~mL of 50% ACN (v/v) solution including 0.1% TFA (v/v) . c.  Equilibrate with 0.9mL of 0.1% TFA (v/v) ; load the sample. d.

Resuspend the final multiplexed sample in 100uL of High pH Buffer A, and use 50~uL (equivalent to 225 u_g of original starting protein amount) for the next steps. Keep the remaining at 80~^°C for backup (it is also possible to dry it again in a speed-vacuum concentrator before storing it, which is advised for long term storage).2. Inject the resuspended sample for off-line, high p H reversed-phase separation and fractionation into a capillary HPLC system equipped with a 25-cm long, 2.1-mm wide (inner diameter) C18 column, at a flow rate of 200 uL/min .3. Perform peptide separation with a binary solvent system consisting of high pH Buffer A and high pH Buffer B, using a gradient from 1% to 6% B from 2min to 6min , to 26% B in 36min , to 53% B in 4min , to 63% B in 3 min , and then at 63% B for 5min .

Mice are the most widely used animal model in reproductive biology research laboratories, but changes in sperm parameters in mice can be subtle and, in the absence of official guidelines, it is important that analyses are carried out in a strict and reproductive manner. This protocol successively details the different steps required to obtain spermatozoa under good conditions, the measurement of sperm motility using a Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis System (CASA) device, the calculation of sperm concentration in the epididymides using a sperm counting cell, and the examination of sperm morphology. The combination of these assays provides an overview of the basic sperm parameters in mice. This is both a diagnostic and a decision-making tool for researchers to orient their scientific strategy according to the observed abnormalities.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

The first two steps of this protocol (sperm recovery and motility analysis) are performed under time and temperature constraints. Sperm motility is a physiological phenomenon that evolves over time and is impacted by the temperature of the environment. To obtain reproducible motility data, the time between sperm extraction and motility measurement has to be the same for all individuals in the study (optimal time would be between 15 and 20 min), and a temperature of 37^°C has to be maintained throughout. As concentration and morphology measurements are not impacted by these factors, they can then be carried out comfortably afterwards, without restrictions.2.  When handling sperm, always use a cut or wide-opening pipette tip (see Figure 1). The use of normal tips induces deleterious effects on the motility and morphology of spermatozoa.()Figure 1. Use wide-opening pipette tips# A. Before beginning the procedure1.  Prepare Petri dishes (two per individual, one per epididymis) with 1~mL of M2 medium and one tube with 5mL of M2 medium. Heat them to 37^°C for at least 2h before starting the experiment. 2.  Prepare the dissection field.Cite as: Martinez, G. et al. (2022). First-line Evaluation of Sperm Parameters in Mice (Mus musculus). Bio-protocol 12(20): e4529. DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4529.3.  Preheat the heating block to 37^°C and place 2~mL microtubes in it (see Figure 2).()# Figure 2. Suggested organization of the heating block4.  Connect the heated blade holder of the CASA.5. Turn on the computer, start the CASA software (Figure 3), and enter the sample numbers if appropriate. Note: The sperm analysis software must have the animal analysis module and be configured according to its user manual. We provide the parameters to be used for mice sperm analysis in Table 1, but we will not go over all the basic configuration elements. For this, please refer to the CEROS II manual.Table 1. Settings for CASA analysis()()Figure 3. Screenshot of the software window# B. Sperm recovery1.  Sacrifice the animal according to the procedures established in your country and validated by your local ethics committees. Note: To obtain reproducible and exploitable data, all animals in the same study should be sacrificed at the same age (we recommend between 10 and 12 weeks for an evaluation of the reproductive function in the mature male).2.  Immediately put the animal on its back on a sterile surgical field and disinfect the abdominal and genital area with ethanol. Note: Simply spray or apply ethanol with a sterile compress.3.  Use surgical scissors to make a horizontal skin incision from one lumbar region to the other (Figure 4A), and a large vertical incision through the hypogastric region to the pelvis region (Figure 4B).4. Expose the organs by incising vertically through the abdominal muscle wall (Figure 4C). Note: A quick check will allow you to spot unexpected flagrant anomalies such as a situs invertus.5. Locate (Figure 4D) and pull upward with surgical clamps the fat deposits located on each side of the pelvic fossae to elevate and expose the testicles (Figure 4E). Note: Be careful not to puncture the bladder.6.  Locate the different structures of the reproductive tract from the testis (Figure 5A). Start with the head of the epididymis visible on the testicle and then proceed to the body, tail, and then the efferent canal.7.  Isolate the tail of the epididymis by incising at one millimeter past the tail-canal junction distally (Figure5B) and at the body-tail junction proximally (Figure 5C), and place it immediately in the pre-warmed M2 medium in Petri dish. Note: Optimal time for steps 1–7 is less than 10 min.()Figure 4. Sequence of surgical procedures for exposure of reproductive organs()Figure 5. Sequence of surgical procedures for epididymal tail isolation with indication of testis (asterisk), epididymal head (cross), and tail (arrow)8.  Dissect the epididymis with two needles under a binocular loupe with a preheated plate at 37 ^°C (Figure 6). Note: It is important to completely drain the tail of the epididymis to obtain the correct concentration of spermatozoa. The dissection must be done very quickly, which can be challenging for a beginner. In this case, always take the same amount of time to dilate the epididymes of the different individuals of the same study. Optimal time for step 8 is less than 10 min (for both epididymis).Cite as: Martinez, G. et al. (2022). First-line Evaluation of Sperm Parameters in Mice (Mus musculus). Bio-protocol 12(20): e4529. DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4529.()# Figure 6. Place the tail of the epididymis so that the incisions are clearly visible.(A) Apply pressure to the tail of the epididymis with a needle to remove the sperm through the vas deferens. (B) The spermatozoa will come out as a jelly that will disintegrate in the medium. (C) Empty the epididymis completely by applying repeated pressure. (D) It may be necessary to pierce the organ in several places to empty it completely.9.  Place the Petri dishes in an incubator at 37 ^°C for 10min to allow the sperm to gain motility. Note: These ten minutes can be used to adjust the CASA settings and fill in the sample identification in the software, if not already done beforehand.# C. Sperm motility assessment1.  Transfer the sperm in M2 medium from the Petri dish to the 2~mL microtube preheated in a 37 ^°C heating block. Note: You can pool the two epididymides of the same individual or treat them separately according to your needs.2.  Take 20uL of suspended semen, place it in a second Eppendorf, then dilute it with preheated M2 medium. Note: The dilution performed depends on the mice strain used. Perform an experiment beforehand on a control individual to identify the dilution to be used for the rest of the study. For example, we use a standard 1:50 dilution for our Black 6 mice but a 1:100 dilution for our OF1 mice.3.  Homogenize and then transfer the sample to a Leja slide. Put the slide in the heated blade holder under the microscope. Note: Wait a few moments for the flow to stabilize in the chamber to prevent the sperm trajectories from being affected by any residual Brownian motion.4.  Confirm that the sperm density is in the acceptable range of the software and check that the sample identification is correct. Note: The software acceptability cut-off is relatively high. We advise to use a concentration that does not lead to a systematic crossing of the trajectories to allow an easier analysis afterwards.5.  Acquire with the software as much field as you may need. Note: For a statistically robust analysis, we recommend acquiring a minimum of 200 motile spermatozoa. Use a “forward walk” reading during the acquisition to avoid taking the same field several times (Figure 7).()# Figure 7. “Forward walk” reading path on a Leja slide6.  Process all samples successively in the same way. Note: The purpose here is to acquire the data (the videos) to being able to interpret them later. Do not waste time interpreting now and focus on acquiring all the samples sequentially.# D. Sperm concentration assessmentNote: We describe here the method used for a Thoma chamber; however, you can use any other type of counting chamber (e.g., Mallassez or Makler) as long as you follow the associated instructions.1. Take 10uL of suspended semen, place it in a third Eppendorf, and add 90uL of sterile H_2O to immobilize the spermatozoa. Note: You can use another dilution, but you will have to take it into account when calculating the final concentration.2. Homogenize and transfer 10~uL to the Thoma counting chamber.3. Count the number of sperm present on two lines to obtain the sperm concentration expressed in millions per milliliter (Figure 8). Note: Count the sperm heads; single flagella are not counted or counted separately. This is also an opportunity to calculate the concentration of any round cells in the ejaculate (germline or immune cells). If you have pooled epididymides, do not forget to multiply by two. You can count more lines and average the results for more accuracy.()Figure 8. Count two full lines of a 1:10 diluted sample to obtain the cell concentration in millions per milliliter# E. Sperm morphology assessment1.  Transfer the remaining samples to 15mL tubes. Add 3mL of 1× PBS. Homogenize by gentle pipetting.2. Centrifuge at 400× g for 5min . Discard the supernatant.3. Add another 3mL of 1× PBS to the pellet.4. Homogenize by gentle pipetting.5. Centrifuge at 400× g for 5min . Discard the supernatant.6. Add another 200~uL of 1×PBS to the pellet.7.  Homogenize by gentle pipetting.8.  Put 10~uL (this volume can be adjusted according to the desired concentration of cells on the slide) at thebase of a clean slide and make a smear with a second slide.Note: The drop must be \"pulled\" and not \"pushed\" by the second blade, which would break the sperm flagella (see Figure 9).()# Figure 9. The smearing blade should be placed in front of the drop and pull it forward.It must not push or cut through the drop.9.  Let dry at room temperature.10. Immerse in a 75% ethanol bath for at least 1h .11. Let dry at room temperature.12. Perform a Harris-Schorr staining by carrying out the following sequence of baths (one immersion corresponds to a duration of approximately 1 s): a. Tap water—15 immersions b. Hematoxylin—2 min c. Tap water—15 immersions d. Ethanol ammoniacal—10 immersions e. Tap water—15 immersions f. Ethanol 50% —5 min g. Shorr—5 min h. Ethanol 50% —5 min i. Ethanol 75% —5 min j. Ethanol 95% —5 min13. Allow the stained slides to dry completely. Note: Any alcohol residue will interfere with the interpretation.14. Mount the slides with Eukitt and a 24:mm×60:mm cover slide. Note: Avoid trapping air bubbles and remove them by applying gentle pressure to the cover slide if necessary.15. Let the mounted smear dry horizontally on absorbent paper for 24h before interpretation.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Pre-Experiment Preparation\nPrepare Petri dishes with 1 mL of M2 medium and one tube with 5 mL of M2 medium, and heat them to 37°C for at least 2 hours before starting the experiment.\nPrepare the dissection field.\nPreheat the heating block to 37°C and place 2 mL microtubes in it.\nConnect the heated blade holder of the CASA and turn on the computer and CASA software.\n## Sperm Recovery\nSacrifice the animal according to established procedures and immediately put it on its back on a sterile surgical field.\nDisinfect the abdominal and genital area with ethanol.\n## Expose Reproductive Organs\nMake a horizontal skin incision from one lumbar region to the other.\nMake a large vertical incision through the hypogastric region to the pelvis region.\nIncise vertically through the abdominal muscle wall to expose the organs.\n## Isolate Epididymal Tail\nLocate the different structures of the reproductive tract from the testis.\nIsolate the tail of the epididymis by incising at one millimeter past the tail-canal junction distally and at the body-tail junction proximally.\nPlace the isolated epididymal tail immediately in pre-warmed M2 medium in a Petri dish.\n## Dissect Epididymis\nDissect the epididymis with two needles under a binocular loupe with a preheated plate at 37°C.\nCompletely drain the tail of the epididymis to obtain the correct concentration of spermatozoa.\n## Sperm Motility Assessment\nTransfer the sperm in M2 medium from the Petri dish to a 2 mL microtube preheated in a 37°C heating block.\nDilute the suspended semen with preheated M2 medium according to the mice strain used.\nHomogenize and transfer the sample to a Leja slide, and put the slide in the heated blade holder under the microscope.\nConfirm that the sperm density is in the acceptable range of the software and check that the sample identification is correct.\nAcquire with the software as much field as needed, using a 'forward walk' reading during the acquisition.\n## Sperm Concentration Assessment\nTake 10 µL of suspended semen, place it in an Eppendorf, and add 90 µL of sterile H2O to immobilize the spermatozoa.\nHomogenize and transfer 10 µL to the Thoma counting chamber.\nCount the number of sperm present on two lines to obtain the sperm concentration expressed in millions per milliliter.\n## Sperm Morphology Assessment\nTransfer the remaining samples to 15 mL tubes, add 3 mL of 1× PBS, and homogenize by gentle pipetting.\nCentrifuge at 400×g for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant, and repeat the centrifugation step.\n## Prepare Smear\nAdd 200 µL of 1× PBS to the pellet and homogenize by gentle pipetting.\nPut 10 µL at the base of a clean slide and make a smear with a second slide.\n## Stain and Mount Smear\nLet the smear dry at room temperature, then immerse in a 75% ethanol bath for at least 1 hour.\nPerform a Harris-Schorr staining, and let the stained slides dry completely.\nMount the slides with Eukitt and a 24×60 mm cover slide, and let the mounted smear dry horizontally on absorbent paper for 24 hours before interpretation.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Model Organism-Specific Techniques"}}

DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4507.necessary as incorporation constructs are stable integrations. Incubate overnight at 37~^°C . See Note 1 for essential controls that should be included in every experiment.2.  On the next day, pick desired colonies from the LB plate and transfer to 1~mL of S750 media in culture tubes. Mix vigorously by pipetting up and down to break up biofilms and promote suspension growth. These serve as the seed cultures for the experiment, without induction of heterologous gene expression. See Note 2 for optional media conditions.3.  Grow in a 37^°C shaking incubator or rotor drum for 4-6 h , to an OD between 0.2 and 0.7.4.  Prepare experimental media (which will serve to induce heterologous gene expression and nsAA incorporation) by adding the desired IPTG and nsAA to S750. IPTG final concentration is 1~mM , which is 1,000× of a 1~M~ stock solution. IPTG is typically added to all cultures including nsAA, except in the case of titration; for double titration see Figure 1. nsAA final concentration is usually 100~uM for most tyrosine-derived nsAAs. 1~mM should be used for boc-K, 5OHW, and CouAA. Similarly, other concentrations can be used for titration (see Figure 1 for an example). Different nsAAs will exhibit different titration dynamics due to the differences in binding to their cognate synthetases. a.  For a 96-well plate format, a suggested higher throughput strategy is to prepare the master mix media unique to each nsAA in 15~mL tubes, then transfer to reservoir and distribute 300~uL with a 1~mL multichannel into a 2~mL deep well plate. In our experience, culture volumes above 300~uL do not aerate well in the deep 96-well plate format. See Figure 2 for the suggested media layout. b.  For single culture tubes, use no more than 1~mL media per tube for aeration reasons.()Figure 1. Double titration with nsAAs and transcriptional inducers.A UAG-mNeongreen construct under the control of a pHyperspank promoter was expressed with variable levels of nsAA and IPTG; a very sensitive induction was possible with low levels of IPTG and titration of nsAA. The signal was normalized to a positive control construct, where a TAC tyrosine codon replaced the UAG stop codon and 1~mM IPTG was provided. For more details, see Data analysis.()# Figure 2. Suggested plate layout for easy plate-filling.This plate layout is easy to set up with a multichannel pipette with minimal errors.5.  Measure OD of the seed cultures, then dilute them with additional S750 to start the experimental cultures at a theoretical density of 0.002 with desired cells. a.  For a 96-well plate setup, dilute cultures with S750 in a PCR tube to OD0.2 , then use a multichannel to distribute 3~uL across the plate as desired, to achieve a final OD of 0.002 in 300~uL of experimental media. b.  For single culture tubes, dilute media appropriately to final OD 0.002. For example, add 4~uL of OD 0.5 seed culture to 1~mL of S750 containing IPTG and nsAA.6.  Incubate tubes/plate overnight, shaking at 37^°C .a.  For 96-well deep well plates, cover with a breathable cover (see Note 4b). Example data are in Figure3a. b.  For clear-bottomed shallow 96-well plates used in time courses, cover with a transparent breathable cover. Shaking should be set to a fast speed, though either orbital or double orbital can be used. Read OD_600 and fluorescence every 5-10min . For the mNeongreen reporter, reading at 488/530 is acceptable, though many different filter settings will work for mNeongreen. Example data in Figure3b.7.  For single culture tubes, grow in a 37^°C shaking incubator or rotor drum.8.  Read endpoint data after overnight growth. Extensively long growth periods will see some decrease of signal, but anything between 14 and 24 h is usually adequate. a.  For fluorescence readout, dilute culture 1:1 with PBS, mix thoroughly, transfer 200 uL to clearbottomed plates, and read OD and fluorescence. If the nsAA used is itself fluorescent, such as CouAA, spin down cells and wash them two to three times in PBS before resuspending in PBS for the plate reader experiment. If attempting microscopy, do washes in 1.5mL tubes, carefully removing as much of the wash as possible in each case, and thoroughly resuspend pellets by pipetting. CouAA’s broad fluorescence spectrum grants very high background unless it is sufficiently washed out. b. For nanoLuciferase readout, add 100~uL culture to a plate, take ODs, then add 100~uL of Nano-Glo luciferase reagent. The Nano-Glo will lyse cells, making OD measurements taken after addition unreliable.()Figure 3. nsAA incorporation data.(A) Endpoint data for nsAA incorporation, using different nsAAs for different AARSs: BipA for bipARS, pAzF for napARS, CouAA for CouRS, BpA for bpaRS, boc-K for the AbkRS. Data processed as discussed in Data Analysis. Biological triplicates were averaged; error bars represent the standard deviation. (B) Time courses for nsAA incorporation; shaded area is standard deviation among biological triplicates.# B. Variant for incorporation with ammoniaS750 (slower growth, less reliable, more accessible import)1.  When trying to do incorporation of nsAAs that do not import well into the cell (likely due to being large and hydrophobic), import may be improved by using media lacking competing amino acids, such as S750 where ammonia is the sole nitrogen source (see recipes for ammoniaS750).2.  Bacillus will grow in this media and incorporation will occur, but significantly more slowly. Replace both the seed culture and experimental media with ammoniaS750, and allocate roughly 50% more growth time, especially for the seed culture, which may take ^6-8~h~ to reach a high enough OD for seeding (minimum OD is approximately 0.2).# C. Variant for incorporation with LB (less reliable, higher background, hindered cellular import)1.  Replace S750 LB starter culture and experimental cultures with LB.2.

Limited treatment options and a high mortality rate underlie the necessity for extensive research of the virulence of C . neoformans. Here we describe a detailed protocol for using the Galleria mellonella (Greater Wax Moth) larvae as a model organism for the virulence analysis of the cryptococcal infections. This protocol describes in detail the evaluation of G_* mellonella larvae viability and the alternatives for troubleshooting the infection procedure. This protocol can be easily modified to study different inocula or fungal species, or the effects of a drug or antifungal agent on fungal disease within the larvae. We describe modified alternative versions of the protocol that allow using G_* . mellonella to study fungal diseases with different inocula and at different temperatures.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Select and separate G. mellonella larvae and prepare Petri dishes, one for each tested group. Larvae are always handled while wearing nitrile gloves to reduce the risk of contamination.2. Use a digital scale to select larvae with a body mass between 100 and 200~mg . Larvae are weighed individually in small polystyrene weigh boats before being transferred into Petri dishes, with up to 15 larvae in each Petri dish.Note: Larvae should be relatively firm to the touch and not exhibit signs of illness, such as dark melanization throughout the body or reduced movement (Figure 1A). There is normal variability in the cuticle pigmentation in healthy larvae. Ideally, larvae will be sorted at least 16–24 h prior to infection to allow acclimatization at room temperature following arrival.()# Figure 1. Evaluation of G. mellonella fitness.(A) Progression of cryptococcal infection in a larva resulting in discoloration and death. (B) Transition of infected larva into the pupa and progression of cryptococcal infection resulting in death. (C) Completed development of the pupa and metamorphosis into moth, which typically occurs at or beyond day 14 under the experimental lab conditions described.# Preparation of fungal cell inoculum3. Approximately 48~h~ prior to the infection, inoculate 5m L of YPD media with the desired strain of C. . neoformans in a 14~mL Snap-Cap culture tube and incubate on the cell culture rotor at 30~^°C , 35 rpm . Alternatively, C. . neoformans can be grown in 1~mL of YPD media overnight (16–24 h) at 30^°C,35rpm .4. Transfer 1~mL of stationary-phase culture to 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes and pellet fungal strain by centrifuging tubes for 4 min at 2,500× g in the tabletop centrifuge.5. Wash your samples twice with DPBS by discarding supernatant and resuspending the pellet in 1~mL of sterile DPBS each time.6. Prepare a 1:100 cell dilution and establish cell concentration using a hemocytometer.7. According to this protocol, diluting cells to this concentration will result in 10^5 cells injected per larvae; if a different inoculum is desired, adjust the cell dilution appropriately. To prepare samples for injecting 10^5 cells per larvae, dilute your washed cells with DPBS to the concentration of 10^7 cells/mL.# Infection of larvae8. Calibrate the stepper device and set to dispense 10uL of liquid prior to the experiment, unless another volume is needed or desired.9. Draw inoculum into a 1~mL tuberculin syringe.10. Invert and flick the syringe until air bubbles rise to the top and air can be expelled, leaving only the prepared inoculum.11. Load the syringe into the stepper device, making sure the syringe is firmly in place, the syringe’s plunger rests against the stepper’s pusher, and the hilt of the syringe rests on syringe clip to prevent slipping and inaccurate dispensing of inoculum.12. Test that the stepper is accurately dispensing the inoculum when the dispense button is pressed.13. Pick up a pre-sorted G . mellonella larva with the non-dominant hand. Hold the larva firmly with thumb and index fingers to prevent movement. Fingers should be placed towards the head and thorax to keep the abdomen open. Be careful not to stick the finger with the syringe needle.14. Inject the needle into the last left proleg (Figure 2). It is important to be consistent with which proleg is injected to reduce variability in the infection. The needle should enter midway through the larva.15. Remove larvae carefully from the needle and place it into a Petri dish. If excessive hemolymph (as indicated by yellow fluid) leaks from the injection site, larval death may occur. If problems with hemolymph leaking persist, leaving the needle in the larvae for 15~s~ before removal may reduce the amount of hemolymph lost. If there are concerns about dried hemolymph on the Petri dish following injection, hemolymph can be cleaned by temporarily removing the larvae, wiping the Petri dish with 70% ethanol, and drying with a paper towel.()# Figure 2.

(B) Photo illustrating the injection site of C. . neoformans cell suspension into the base of larva’s proleg. (C) Close up photo of the injection site.# Incubation and maintenance of the tested larvae16. After finishing the series of injections, transfer Petri dishes with larvae to the location with desired temperature for the analysis (room temperature or 30^°C_. ).17. Perform evaluation of larvae variability every day by checking for changes in color of each larva and by gently poking the larva using the pointy end of a pipette tip.If survival of pupae is also assayed, check pupal survival by gently pressing down on pupae with the base of the pipette tip. Lack of movement following poking indicates death. Change of body color in deceased G. mellonella larvae progress from an initial creamy color to grey, brown, and black (Figure 1A). Healthy pupae start off white and yellow, and naturally become a light to medium brown color, whereas dead pupae show a dark brown to black color (Figure 1B).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Selection of Larvae with Desirable Mass\nSelect and separate G. mellonella larvae and prepare Petri dishes, one for each tested group.\nUse a digital scale to select larvae with a body mass between 100 and 200 mg.\nWeigh larvae individually in small polystyrene weigh boats before transferring them into Petri dishes, with up to 15 larvae in each Petri dish.\nEnsure larvae are relatively firm to the touch and not exhibit signs of illness, such as dark melanization throughout the body or reduced movement.\n## Preparation of Fungal Cell Inoculum\nInoculate 5 mL of YPD media with the desired strain of C. neoformans in a 14 mL Snap-Cap culture tube and incubate on the cell culture rotor at 30°C, 35 rpm.\nAlternatively, C. neoformans can be grown in 1 mL of YPD media overnight (16-24 h) at 30°C, 35 rpm.\n## Cell Pellet and Washing\nTransfer 1 mL of stationary-phase culture to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and pellet fungal strain by centrifuging tubes for 4 min at 2,500 × g in the tabletop centrifuge.\nWash samples twice with DPBS by discarding supernatant and resuspending the pellet in 1 mL of sterile DPBS each time.\n## Cell Dilution and Concentration\nPrepare a 1:100 cell dilution and establish cell concentration using a hemocytometer.\nDilute washed cells with DPBS to the concentration of 10^7 cells/mL for injecting 10^5 cells per larvae.\n## Infection of Larvae\nCalibrate the stepper device and set to dispense 10 μL of liquid prior to the experiment.\nDraw inoculum into a 1 mL tuberculin syringe and expel air bubbles.\nLoad the syringe into the stepper device, ensuring the syringe is firmly in place.\nTest that the stepper is accurately dispensing the inoculum when the dispense button is pressed.\n## Larvae Injection\nPick up a pre-sorted G. mellonella larva and hold it firmly with thumb and index fingers to prevent movement.\nInject the needle into the last left proleg, entering midway through the larva.\nRemove larvae carefully from the needle and place them into a Petri dish.\n## Incubation and Maintenance of the Tested Larvae\nTransfer Petri dishes with larvae to the location with the desired temperature for the analysis (room temperature or 30°C).\nPerform evaluation of larvae variability every day by checking for changes in color and by gently poking the larva using the pointy end of a pipette tip.\nCheck pupal survival by gently pressing down on pupae with the base of the pipette tip, if assaying pupae survival.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Microbiology & Virology"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-676","title":"Differential Expression Analysis: Simple Pair, Interaction, Time-series","text":"Differential Expression Analysis: Simple Pair, Interaction, Time-series\n\n# Abstract\n\nIdentifying differentially expressed (DE) genes across specific conditions is vital in understanding phenotypic variation. The fast-growing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides much information that efficiently quantifies gene expression. Methods and tools dedicated to differential gene expression analysis from RNA-seq data have also increased rapidly. More than 30 DE methods have been published; however, many comparison studies highlight that no single method outperforms others in all circumstances. In this study, we test and compare the performances of three widely used R packages: edgeR, DESeq2, and limma voom, with published Cumbie’s Arabidopsis thaliana data. Even though the standard DE analysis has been extensively used and improved over the past years, time course RNA-seq can also provide an advanced understanding of gene regulation, biological development, and identifying DE genes. Therefore, we also conducted a time course analysis using another published Ursache’s Arabidopsis time course dataset. These methods are initiated in separate R packages, with detailed R codes and explanations constructed to help build a more convenient user experience.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\n# Case study 1: A comparison of three methods for DGE analysis# Input dataTo demonstrate, here we use the Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-Seq data published by Cumbie et al. (2011). Summarized count data is available as an R dataset, and readers can download the data using the link http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/edgeR/UserGuideData/arab.rds. In Cumbie’s experiment, they inoculate six-week-old Arabidopsis plants with the mutant of Pseudomonas syringae. Control plants were inoculated with a mock pathogen. Each treatment was done as biological triplicates, with each pair of replicates done at separate times, and derived from independently grown plants and bacteria.()# Figure 1. Workflow of DGE analysis for RNA-seq data.Pink boxes correspond to pipelines for count-based models (e.g., DESeq2 and edgeR), while blue boxes correspond to a linear-model-based pipeline (e.g., limma voom)The general workflow involves the following steps (Figure 1): deciphering RNA-seq data characteristics, checking data quality, filtering and normalization, specification of the statistical model and estimation of model parameters, statistical inference of the parameters, multiple testing, and visualization of the analysis results.# A.  Exploring RNA-seq count data1.  Loading all required R packages # Loading R packages library(GEOquery) library(DESeq2) library(edgeR)library(limma) library(ggplot2) library(pheatmap) library(Glimma) library(dplyr) library(readr)2.  Downloading and importing of RNA-seq count data A matrix of counts summarizing the gene-level expression in each dataset sample is needed to start a differential gene expression analysis. We can download and import the processed read counts as ‘arab.rds’ file.# Specify URL where file is stored url <- \"http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/edgeR/UserGuideData/arab.rds\"# Specify destination where file should be saved destfile << \"~/PATH/TO/FILE/arab.rds\"# Apply download.file function in R download.file(url, destfile)# Import the input r dataset raw_counts <- readRDS(destfile)# Check out the import raw counts matrix head(raw_counts)## mock1 mock2 mock3 hrcc1 hrcc2 hrcc3## AT1G01010 35 77 40 46 64 60## AT1G01020 43 45 32 43 39 49## AT1G01030 16 24 26 27 35 20## AT1G01040 72 43 64 66 25 90## AT1G01050 49 78 90 67 45 60## AT1G01060 0 15 2 0 21 8# Create group vector group << c('mock','mock','mock','hrcc','hrcc','hrcc')The rows in the count data correspond to genes, and the columns correspond to samples, in which we want to see if differences across conditions are significant. The integer value in each matrix position represents the number of sequence reads that originated from a particular gene in a specific sample.3.  Characteristics of RNA-seq count data To illustrate typical features of Arabidopsis count data, we could start with a counts histogram for a single sample (‘mock1’).ggplot(data.frame(raw_counts)) ^+ geom_histogram(aes( X= mock1), stat = \"bin\", bins = 200) + xlab(\"Raw counts\") ^+ ylab(\"Number of genes\")()Figure 2. Histogram of the counts for the single sample (‘mock1’).As expected, RNA-seq count data usually contains a large number of genes associated with a small number of counts (Figure 2). Another vital property that could be accessed here is the relationship between mean and variance. It can help demonstrate which distribution is appropriate for modeling the count data in RNA-seq. For example, three replicates of ‘mock’ control group are used here.# Mean versus variance # compute a vector of mean values mean_counts << apply(raw_counts,1:3, 1, mean)# Compute a vector of variance values variance_counts <_- apply(raw_counts,1:3, 1, var)# Plot the relationship between mean and variance df <- data.frame(mean_counts, variance_counts)ggplot(df) ^+ geom_point(aes( dotx= (mean_counts +1 ), y= (variance_counts +1 ))) + scale_ y_l o g l0(limits=c(1,1e9))+ scale_ operatornamet_log10(operatornamelimits=operatornamec(1,1e9))+ geom_abline(intercept =0 , slope =1 , color=\"red\")()Figure 3. Scatterplot of the mean vs. the variance.In Figure 3, we can conclude that genes with higher mean expression tend to have higher variance than the mean across replicates. Therefore, our data fails to satisfy the Poisson distribution criteria, in which mean equals variance. For our data, negative binomial and log-normal distributions could be a better fit.4. Quality assessmentTo ensure that the replicates of each group are reasonable, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and MDS analysis are performed here. Biological replicates are expected to be similar to each other, even if experimental errors cannot be ignored. Potential outliers can also be identified, and a determination of whether they need to be removed made prior to DGE analysis. These unsupervised methods are run using regularized log (rlog) transformed normalized counts as input for better visualization, and avoiding bias from the abundance of low-counts genes. The initial purpose of count normalization is to accurately compare gene expression among samples. More than five methods are now available for normalization, such as CPM, TPM, FPKM, TMM, and DESeq2’s median of ratios method (Van den Berge et al., 2019). DESeq2’s median of ratios method is chosen here for an example.Input data for DEseq2 consists of non-normalized read counts, at either gene or transcript levels. The input, intermediate, and result data are stored in a pre-specified data slot (DESeq object), which can be accessed and retrieved using specific package-defined functions.# No preliminary normalization of this data is needed in DEseq2 colData << data.frame(row.names=colnames(raw_counts), group=group)# Create DESeq objectdds << DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, colData = colData, design = group)# Retrieve the original count matrix head(counts(dds))## AT1G01010 35 77 40 46 64 60## AT1G01020 43 45 32 43 39 49## AT1G01030 16 24 26 27 35 20## AT1G01040 72 43 64 66 25 90## AT1G01050 49 78 90 67 45 60## AT1G01060 0 15 2 0 21 8# Normalization to generate size factors.

By default, plotPCA() uses the top 500 most variable genes. You can add the ntop ^*= argument, and specify how many genes are being displayed.### Plot PCAplotPCA(rld, intgroup=\"group\")()Figure 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for ‘mock’ and ‘hrcc’ samples.When interpreting PCA plots (Figure 4), if two samples have similar expression levels for the genes that contribute significantly to the variation represented by a particular PC (Principal Component), they will be plotted close together. For the example displayed above, when visualizing PC1 and PC2, we can see examples separated by treatment, and are optimistic about the DGE analysis.# Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plotSimilar to PCA, the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When data has been MDS-transformed, the first two dimensions explain the most significant variance among all samples. An interactive R widget for generating plots is created and exported as HTML documents (Su et al., 2017).# glimmaMDS(dds)We get two plots (Figure 5), showing two MDS dimensions, and the other one of each dimension’s eigenvalues. For the example displayed above, when visualizing dim1 and dim2, we can see samples separated by treatment, and are optimistic about the DGE analysis.()scale_by oxed-or colour_by group shape_by- ? colourschemelcategory10# Hierarchical Clustering HeatmapHierarchical clustering heatmaps display the correlation of gene expression for all pairwise combinations of samples in the dataset.### Extract the rlog matrix from the object rld_mat << assay(rld)### Compute pairwise correlation values rld_cor << cor(rld_mat)### Plot heatmap using the correlation matrix and the metadata object pheatmap(rld_cor, annotation_col = colData)Overall, we observe pretty high correlations across the board (>0.985) , suggesting no outlying samples (Figure 6). Also, you see the clustering of the samples together by sample group, except for the ‘hrcc2’ sample. Together with the PCA and MDS plot, it is suggested that the RNA-seq data are of good quality, and we have the green light to proceed to differential expression analysis.()Figure 6. Hierarchical clustering heatmap for the correlation of gene expression for all pairwise sample combinations.# B.  Differential gene expression (DGE) analysisThe final step in the differential expression analysis workflow is fitting the raw counts to the specific model, and performing the statistical test for differentially expressed genes. In this step, we essentially want to determine whether the mean expression levels of different sample groups are significantly different.# 1.  DESeq2 methodThe DESeq2 is one of the most popular tools for DGE analysis, and is modeled based on the negative binomial distribution. It builds on the design on dispersion estimation and use of Generalized Linear Models, from the DSS and edgeR methods. Briefly, DESeq2 will model the raw counts, using normalization factors for accounting for differences in library depth. Then, it will estimate the gene-wise dispersions, and shrink these estimates, to generate more accurate estimates of dispersion to model the counts. Finally, DESeq2 will fit the negative binomial model, and perform hypothesis testing, using the Wald test or Likelihood Ratio Test.To get our differential expression results from our raw count data, only one line of code is needed. NOTE: DESeq2 does not use normalized counts; instead, it uses the raw counts, and models the normalization inside the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Furthermore, the Wald test is the default used for hypothesis testing when comparing two groups.## Run pipeline for differential expression steps dds << DESeq(dds) ## estimating size factors ## estimating dispersions ## gene-wise dispersion estimates ## mean-dispersion relationship ## final dispersion estimates ## fitting model and testinga. Estimating the Dispersion As shown in the printed out message, six steps are performed. The second and third steps are about dispersion, which accounts for a gene’s variance and mean expression level to identify DE genes accurately. A dispersion plot can ensure if the data is a good fit for the DESeq2 model. You expect the data to generally scatter around the curve, with the dispersion decreasing with increasing mean expression levels. If you see a cloud or different shapes, we will suspect a contamination (mitochondrial, etc.), or outlier samples.()## Plot dispersion estimates plotDispEsts(dds)Figure 7. Dispersion estimates plot derived by DESeq2.mean of normalized countsEach black dot is a gene in Figure 7, where the dispersion is plotted against the mean expression, across within-group replicates per gene. We see a nice decrease in dispersion with increasing mean expression, which is good, as we expected. We also see strong shrinkage, likely because we only have three replicates for each group. The more replicates the data has, the less shrinkage is applied to the dispersion estimates, and the more DE genes can be identified in the model.b. Extracting resultsWe set the alpha argument to 0.05 FDR<0.05) ) when creating our results table.

Volcano plot showing both significantly increased and decreased genes.2. edgeR methodThe edgeR is another famed Bioconductor package, designed to analyze replicated count-based expression data. The RNA-seq count data is modeled as a negative binomial distribution. Then, edgeR estimates the gene-wise dispersions by conditional maximum likelihood. An empirical Bayes procedure is effectively employed, to shrink the dispersions for a consensus value. Finally, an exact test, analogous to Fisher’s exact test, is used for accessing DE genes.Like DESeq2, all the information in edgeR should be contained in a simple list-based data object called a DGEList, defined as variable d. When we use any function from this package later, the function passes everything already in d, but adds one more element to the list.a.

Filtering the data First, get rid of genes that do not occur frequently enough. In this example, we keep genes with at least ten counts per million (CPM) on any particular gene.# keeping a gene if it has a cpm of 1 or greater for at least two samples keep <_- rowSums(cpm(d.full)> 10) >= 2 d<- d.fullkeep, , keep.lib.size = FALSE c.  Normalizing the dataThe filtered genes have very little power to detect DE genes, so little information is lost. After filtering, it is a good idea to reset the library sizes. Note that the “size factor” from DESeq is not equal to the “norm factor” in edgeR. In edgeR, the library size and additional normalization scaling factors are separate. Instead, the multiplication of lib.size and norm.factors is similar to DESeq’s size factor. The edgeR is concerned with relative changes in expression levels between conditions, but not directly with estimating absolute expression levels. The calcNormFactors() function normalizes RNA composition, by finding a set of scaling factors for the library sizes that minimize the log-fold changes between the samples for most genes. The default method for computing these scale factors uses a trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) between each pair of samples.# # Reset the library sizesdsamplesib.size << colSums(dcounts) dsamples ## group lib.size norm.factors ## mock1 mock 1864904 1 ## mock2 mock 1861966 1 ## mock3 mock 3198005 1 ## hrcc1 hrcc 2081410 1 ## hrcc2 hrcc 1239164 1 ## hrcc3 hrcc 3464954 1# Normalization: without this, the default value is 1 for all values in dsamplesnorm.factors. d<- calcNormFactors(d)dsamplesnorm.factors## 1 0.9755468 1.0223637 0.9111577 1.0625561 1.0805495 0.9584212d.  Estimating the Dispersion (GLM) Several dispersion estimating strategies are available in edgeR, such as the typical and tagwise dispersion, and the generalized linear model (GLM). We use GLM as an example here.# Specify the model to be fitted design << model.matrix Large~~0+dmathbbS samplesgroup)# Changing column and row names rownames(design) < -colnames(d) colnames(design) <- levels(dsamplesgroup)# Fit the common dispersion d<- estimateGLMCommonDisp(d,design)# Fit a trended model: the default is \"auto\" which chooses \"bin.spline\" when > 200 tags and \"power\" otherwise.d<- estimateGLMTrendedDisp(d, design, method=\"power\")# Fit the tagwise dispersion d<- estimateGLMTagwiseDisp(d,design)plotBCV() plots the tagwise biological coefficient of variation (square root of dispersions) against log2-CPM.plotBCV(d)()Average log CPM# Figure 11. Dispersion estimates plot derived by edgeR.In Figure 11, we see that the estimate for the coefficient of variation is a pretty good model, since tagwise dispersion follows the model, and decreases as the counts per million (CPM) increase. Experiments with low biological variation tend to result in decreasing solid trends. A typical dispersion between 0.2 and 0.4 is reasonable, and can detect more DE genes.e. GLM testing for DE genesOnce the dispersions are estimated, we can test procedures for determining differential expression.# # Fitting the GLM modelfit <- glmFit(d, design) lrt <- glmLRT(fit, contrast=c(-1,1))# Exploring the result for the top 10 genes topTags(lrt, n=10 ) ## Coefficient:  -1*hrcc 1*mock## logFC    logCPM LR PValue FDR## AT2G19190 -4.470085  7.384364 97.44749 5.530364e-23 6.985955e-19## AT2G44370 -5.369560  5.210092 93.79023 3.507983e-22 2.215642e-18## AT3G46280 -4.829993  8.101120 92.77938 5.846105e-22 2.461600e-18## AT2G39380 -4.878171  5.777015 91.22144 1.284608e-21 4.056792e-18## AT3G55150 -5.728111  4.922097 88.62638 4.768867e-21 1.204806e-17## AT1G51820 -4.313016  6.386803 87.68153 7.688922e-21 1.484531e-17## AT2G39530 -4.288573  6.721358 87.54786 8.226500e-21 1.484531e-17## AT4G12500 -4.348063 10.465187 84.93923 3.076770e-20 4.858219e-17## AT1G51850 -5.220131  5.418258 81.18163 2.058971e-19 2.889880e-16## AT5G48430 -6.198516  6.762521 79.11222 5.868026e-19 7.412490e-16# # Extracting all DE genesedgeR_diff<- as.data.frame(topTags(lrt, n= nrow(d)))### Set thresholds fdr.cutoff <relax-0.05# Subset the tibble to keep only significant genesedgeR_sig << edgeR_diffwhich(edgeR_diffFDR < fdr.cutoff), edgeR_sig << edgeR_sigorder(edgeR_sigFDR),We now get our DE genes.

Scatterplot highlighting both significantly increased and decreased genes.3.  Limma voom method Limma is an R package initially developed for DE analysis of microarray data. To deal with RNA-seq data, we can use a function called voom in the limma package. Limma-voom is also a choice for DE analyses, because it allows for incredibly flexible model specifications, including categorical and continuous variables. It can also maintain the false discovery rate at or below the nominal rate. In addition, Empirical Bayes smoothing of gene-wise standard deviations can provide increased power.a. Preprocessing Steps before normalization in limma-voom are precisely the same as in the edgeR method.dge.full <- DGEList(counts=raw_counts) keep <_- rowSums( s p m(dge.full)>10)>=2 dge <_- dge.fullkeep, , keep.lib.size  r= FALSE dgesamplesib.size << colSums(dgecounts) dge <_- calcNormFactors(dge, method = \"TMM\")design << model.matrix 0+ factor(group)) colnames(design)=levels(factor(group)) rownames(design)=colnames(raw_counts)b. Voom transformationWhen operating on a DGEList-object, voom converts raw counts to log-CPM values, by automatically extracting library sizes and normalization factors from itself. Firstly, counts are transformed to log2 counts per million reads (CPM). Next, a linear model is fitted to the log2 CPM for each gene, and the residuals are calculated. Then, a smoothed curve is fitted to the residual standard deviation by average expression (red line in plot). The smoothed curve is used to obtain weights for each gene and sample that are passed into limma.v <- voom(dge, design, plot=TRUE, normalize=\"quantile\")()log2( count size + 0.5 )# Figure 13. The voom plot.The smoothed curve is used to obtain weights for each gene and sample that are passed into limma, along with the log2 CPMs.Figure 13 presents a good voom plot, since the standard deviation decreases as log2 CPM increases.c.  Fitting linear models Linear modeling in limma is carried out using the lmFit() and contrasts.fit() functions, which can be used for microarray and RNA-seq data. Firstly, it fits a separate model to the expression values for each gene. Next, empirical Bayes moderation is carried out, by borrowing information across all the genes, to obtain more precise estimates of gene-wise variability.# Fit a linear model using weighted least squares for each gene fit <- lmFit(v, design)# Comparison between two groups cont.matrix <- makeContrasts(contrasts =c ('hrcc-mock'),levels = design)# Estimate contrast for each gene vfit<- contrasts.fit(fit,cont.matrix)# Empirical Bayes smoothing of standard errors efit<- eBayes(vfit)# Extracte all DE genes: the number of top genes displayed can be specified, where n= Inf includes all genes.dt<- decideTests(efit)tempOutput<-  topTable(efit, coef='hrcc-mock', n=Inf)limma_diff<- na.omit(tempOutput)head(limma_diff)## logFC  AveExpr t P.Value adj.P.Val B## AT5G64120 3.908648 8.881249 13.94908 3.418414e-08 0.0001553088 9.044827## AT4G12500 4.625995 9.347227 13.74362 3.974484e-08 0.0001553088 8.901277## AT4G12490 3.995841 9.288587 13.17012 6.120240e-08 0.0001553088 8.556108## AT2G39200 3.992872 8.002553 12.92873 7.376924e-08 0.0001553088 8.397109## AT2G19190 4.486845 6.075911 13.50837 4.735025e-08 0.0001553088 8.287488## AT3G46280 4.752270 6.614062 13.07000 6.610640e-08 0.0001553088 8.227511# Set thresholdsadj.p.cutoff <_0.05# Subset the tibble to keep only significant genes limma_sig <- limma_diffwhich(limma_diffadj.P.Val < adj.p.cutoff), limma_sig <- limma_sigorder(limma_sigadj.P.Val),The model’s residual variances are plotted against average expression values below (Figure 14), with significant DE genes highlighted.

Scatterplot highlighting both significantly increased and decreased genes.# C.  A comparison of the three methodsVisualization of DGE results using the three selected DGE tools provides valuable insights into their generated results. As seen in Figures 15A, B, the three methods detect similar numbers of DE genes, and most of them are identical. When we set the FDR cutoff to 0.05, they would behave differently. DESeq2 detects the most DE genes, while the limma voom detects the least. However, the significant genes detected by limma voom could almost be found by edgeR and DESeq2 (Figures 15C). Then we could infer that limma voom is more critical than the other two when calling significant DE genes.()Figure 15. Visualization of DGE results for DESeq2, edgeR and limma voom methods.(A) Numbers of DE and significantly DE genes detected by three selected methods. (B) Numbers of overlapping and different DE genes between the three methods. (C) Numbers of overlapping and different significant DE genes between the three methods (FDR <0.05 ).Let us look at the detected fold changes from all three methods. Here, the genes are colored differently to label which methods find them significant. Supposing that a gene is colored yellow-wish green, this means that both methods find it. Matching the results in Figure 15, the outputs of DESeq2 and edgeR are very close indeed, since their fold changes correlate much better than the other two methods (Figure 16A, B, C). All three methods behaved well in finding the significant DE genes, while DESeq2 caught more candidates than the other two. It turns out that the genes detected only by DESeq2 have pretty low counts. The DESeq2 goes through the logic of independent filtering within results() to save from multiple test corrections on genes with no power, showing that the likelihood of a gene being significantly differentially expressed is related to how strongly it is expressed. It advocates discarding extremely lowly expressed genes, because the differential expression is likely not statistically detectable, so it is unnecessary to prefilter low count genes, as recommended in the vignette. However, in edgeR and limma voom, we performed a minimal count-based pre-filtering to keep only rows with a CPM of at least ten, for at least two samples total. After filtering, the candidate genes with apparently moderate fold changes detected by DESeq2 are removed in edgeR and limma voom. We suggest users try different methods with variable parameters, and then choose the most suitable one.()Figure 16. The comparison of DESeq2, edgeR and limma voom methods.

This experiment aimed to uncover whether the differentiated endodermal cells have a distinct transcriptional response to auxin treatment. A time series of 10~uM NAA treatment was performed, and samples collected at t=0,2,4,8 , 16, and 24hrs after NAA treatment (Ursache et al., 2021). For the time series, we compared roots of the solitary root 1 (slr-1) mutant to the CASP1::shy 2-2/slr-1 double mutant. The raw data from the NCBI database (Ursache et al., 2021) was processed, and saved as a RangedSummarizeExperiment RData file. The processed data can be downloaded from Github, through this link: https://github.com/hanqu24/RNA-seqanalysis/blob/main/Arabidopsis%20time%20course%20analysis/arab_time.RData.When working with time course RNA-seq data, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is predominantly desirable. We can choose the LRT (in DESeq() function) to explore any significant differences across a series of time points, and further evaluate differences observed between sample groups. Here, we demonstrate a fundamental time course analysis with an Arabidopsis dataset, containing gene counts for an RNA-seq time course.# Loading the data load(\"PATH/TO/FILE/arab_time.RData\")# # Check the datahead(arab_time)## class: SummarizedExperiment## dim: 6 36## metadata(1): ''## assays(1): counts## rownames(6): AT1G01010 AT1G01020 ...

For better understanding, we can plot the counts of the groups over time for the gene with the smallest adjusted p - value, testing for condition-dependent time profile, and accounting for differences at time 0 (Figure 17).

If we look at these clusters’ gene ontology (GO) annotations, you might observe terms linked to auxin signaling and lateral root development, as expected.# DiscussionWith the rising of RNA-seq technology, the sequencing protocols have been continuously improved. Ching et al. (2014) underlined that no single software consistently showed the best performance across the datasets they had studied (Ching et al., 2014). By looking at the considerations of citation numbers and opinions from other researchers, we then decided to compare the following three widely used methods: DESeq2, edgeR, and limma voom. Like other studies, edgeR and DESeq2 give roughly similar results, while limma voom seems more stringent when calling significant DE genes. Furthermore, the edgeR and limma voom work faster compared to DESeq2, for fitting GLM models. Regardless, it seems that some tools are particularly suitable in certain circumstances. Limma voom performs better with large sample sizes, and even a limited number of replicates (Soneson and Delorenzi, 2013; Seyednasrollah et al., 2015). DESeq2 is the safest choice with a small number of replicates, ensuring adequately significant DE genes (Seyednasrollah et al., 2015). The edgeR gives variable results with small replicates, but it has superior specificity and sensitivity than limma voom when there are more replicates (Rapaport et al., 2013; Seyednasrollah et al., 2015). We suggest users try different tools taking into account the actual conditions of their data, for example, replicate numbers, library size, the distances between the biological conditions, and the variance of each replicate.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to Case Study 1\nThe case study compares three methods for Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-Seq data published by Cumbie et al.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-700","title":"Protocol to Isolate Germinal Centers by Laser Microdissection","text":"Protocol to Isolate Germinal Centers by Laser Microdissection\n\n# Abstract\n\nDuring adaptive immune responses, germinal centers (GC) appear as transient microstructures, in which antigenspecific B and T cells interact with each other. Because only the antigen-activated B and T cells, such as Plasmablasts or follicular T helper (Tfh) cells, are present in GC, the in depth-analysis of GC is of great interest. To identify the cells that reside within GC, the majority of studies use the expression of specific surface molecules for analysis by flow cytometry. To do so, the tissue has to be disrupted for the preparation of single-cell suspensions. Thereby, the local information regarding neighborhoods of B cells and T cells and their potential interaction is lost. To study GC in vivo within their original microenvironment, we established a protocol for the isolation of GC by laser microdissection. To enable the identification of GC for subsequent transcriptomic analysis, the degradation of mRNA was diminished by using frozen tissues and by establishing a rapid staining protocol. This procedure enables histological and transcriptomic analysis of individual GC even within one lymphoid organ.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Preparation of lymphoid organs for isolation of GC by laser microdissectionTo enable transcriptional analysis, it is required to isolate GC while preserving mRNA at a high quality. Therefore, activated lymph nodes were fixed by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvest and removal of adipose tissues (Figure 1A). Subsequently, tissues are stored in a -80^°C refrigerator. Cryosections are prepared at -20^°C using a cryomicrotom without allowing the tissue to thaw. To minimize the loss of RNA, two stainings are required to accurately identify GC: a short staining protocol with toluidine blue that preserves the mRNA and an immunohistochemical staining that allows the identification of GC and Tfh cells. To compare both stainings, serial cryosections were prepared on two slides: (i) a membrane slide for toluidine blue-staining and for laser microdissection; and (ii) a glass slide for immunohistochemical staining to visualize GC, T cells, and B cells (Figure 1B–1C and Figure 2). Of note, to preserve the mRNA, the incubation of the tissue sections in aqueous solutions should be as short as possible, such as the 2-2-2 min washing-toluidine blue-washing incubation described here (steps e–g). Because RNases lose most of their activity in dehydrated dried tissues (step h), the slides can be stored before further processing (step i).For troubleshooting, to optimize the staining protocol and to test for RNA integrity, it is recommended to cut one whole section from the membrane slide before and after staining and compare RNA concentrations (either by OD measurements or by PCRs).1.  Staining of cryosections on membrane slides with toluidine blue for laser microdissection a.

Afterwards, rinse tissues in TBS-Tween for 15min and cover the lymph node section with 4% PFA and incubate them at 4^°C for 45min .d. Rinse glass slides in TBS-Tween for 10min and draw a circle around each tissue section with a Dako Pen to confine the liquids during staining.e.

Take the immunohistochemical-stained slide and put it on the object table of a usual light microscope that should stand close to the PALM MicroBeam microscope.f. Carefully compare the two slides for the identification of GC. Note that samples that were closer in cryosections must be compared together (e.g., identify the GC by comparing cryosections 1 to 2 and 3).2.  Isolation of GC by laser microdissectiona.  Before activating the laser beam, prepare the cap of the microtube and moisten it carefully with a very thin layer of mineral oil.b. Put the cap and the microtube into the provided holder (Figure 3B).c. Following the instruction of the manufacturer’s protocol, adjust the laser beam to the digital pen of the painting app by using the Palm Robo software. In addition, use a spot on the slide that is not covered with tissue to select the thickness of the laser beam. This can be done by fine-tuning the laser energy and the speed of the microbeam mover.d. Cautiously surround the identified GC by using the digital pen of the painting app. It is required to carefully close the circled area with the digital pencil (Video 1).()# Video 1. Laser capturing of lymphoid tissue compartments.A toluidine blue-stained section of a rat spleen is used as an example for the microdissection of a B cell zone from lymphoid tissues.1. The T- and B-cell zone can be clearly distinguished. 2. The area of interest, in this case, is a primary B cell follicle, which is circled using the drawing tool from the Palm Robo software. 3. The command “RoboLPC” from the Palm Robo software activates the laser beam to cut the marked tissue and the underlying membrane. An additional UV laser pulse catapults the isolated area into the cap of the microtube.e.  Place the cap holder directly over the slide to collect these predefined areas (Figure 3C).f.  Activate the laser beam to cut and catapult the isolated area by using the command “RoboLPC”. The UV-laser cuts the marked line and catapults the GC into the cap of the microtube (Video 1 and Figure 3D).g.  After collection of GC tissue (here: 2×10^6–10×10^6um^2 per sample), remove the cap and microtube. Pool all microdissected and catapulted tissue pieces by closing the microtube with the cap and spinning down with a centrifuge. Collected tissues can be used for subsequent analysis.()# Figure 3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-701","title":"Simple Methods  for  Permanent or Transient Denervation in Mouse Sciatic Nerve Injury Models","text":"Simple Methods  for  Permanent or Transient Denervation in Mouse Sciatic Nerve Injury Models\n\n# Abstract\n\nOur ability to move and breathe requires an efficient communication between nerve and muscle that mainly takes place at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), a highly specialized synapse that links the axon of a motor neuron to a muscle fiber. When NMJs or axons are disrupted, the control of muscle fiber contraction is lost and muscle are paralyzed. Understanding the adaptation of the neuromuscular system to permanent or transient denervation is a challenge to understand the pathophysiology of many neuromuscular diseases. There is still a lack of in vitro models that fully recapitulate the in vivo situation, and in vivo denervation, carried out by transiently or permanently severing the nerve afferent to a muscle, remains a method of choice to evaluate reinnervation and/or the consequences of the loss of innervation. We describe here a simple surgical intervention performed at the hip zone to expose the sciatic nerve in order to obtain either permanent denervation (nerve-cut) or transient and reversible denervation (nervecrush). These two methods provide a convenient in vivo model to study adaptation to denervation.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. Metacam®, 1.5mg/mL oral suspension for dogs (Boehringer Ingelheim)\n2.

Adjust the isoflurane to 3-4% and the oxygen flow to 0.8-1.5L/min . Once anesthetized the mouse loses all its tonus For a more detailed procedure, please refer to previously described protocols (Davis, 2008).()# Figure 1. Isoflurane anesthesia set-up.3.  Cover Mouse cornea with a drop of Ocrygel® to prevent eyes from drying-up during the procedure.4.  Anesthetize mouse using an intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine/xylazine mix ( 100~mg Ketamine/kg weight and 10~mg xylazine/ kg weight) previously diluted in a 10mM phosphate buffered saline solution. Use a 25G needle mounted on a 3mL syringe.5.  To prevent pain due to the surgical procedure, perform a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine at the site of incision (0.1~mg/kg weight). Use a 25G needle mounted on a 3mL syringe.6. Place the mouse on the heating mat during the whole procedure to avoid any hypothermia.7.

Skin stitching surgery.15. Allow the mice to recover gently from anesthesia in the heating cabinet (25^°C) .16. Analysis of denervation effects can be appreciated by following NMJs structural changes on Tibialis anterior isolated muscle fibers. Using immunofluorescence approaches, 3 days post-surgery you will observe the absence of SV2B labeling on isolated fibers (Figure 4A–4B). Likewise, for the nerve crush procedure, you will observe the reinnervation after 15 days as SV2B staining’s begins to progressively reappear (Figure 4C–4D). Note that the overall cross section area (CSA) of muscle fibers will decreased rapidly in the course of denervation/regeneration (Ghasemizadeh et al., 2021). Alterations of the NMJs structure such as fragmentation of AchRs, disruption of NMJs area and/or decrease of synaptic myonuclei number above the NMJs can be tracked as previously described (Jones et al., 2016; Osseni et al., 2020; Ghasemizadeh et al., 2021). Analysis of transcriptional changes by monitoring gene expression along the regeneration processes also allow characterization of the time course of NMJs alterations. mRNA or proteins encoded by genes such as MyoD (Myoblast determination protein1), Myog (Myogenin), AchRa,,gamma,,varepsilon (Acetylcholine Receptor a,,gamma,,varepsilon subunits), MITR (MEF2 interacting Transcription Repressor), N R G I-a, (Neuregulin- alpha, ) and MusK (Muscle skeletal receptor tyrosine-protein kinase) will be key to determine the correct time course of denervation/reinnervation (Méjat et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2015; Morano et al., 2018).()# Figure 4. Sciatic nerve denervation procedure effects.Isolated fibers of tibialis anterior muscle from 2-months-old WT double-stained with an antibody against synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B (SV2B, in green) to label the presynaptic domain of NMJs and with α- bungarotoxin–A594 (in red) to label the postsynaptic domain of NMJs. Representative immunofluorescence images of non-injured nerve (A), definitive denervation procedure (B) after 3 days and transient denervation procedure after 3 days (C) or 18 days (D). Scale bars, 10~um .# Notes1.  The main difficulty lay in the precision to locate the area for skin incision (Figure 2A). You must not be too much towards the spine or the knee or both too much above the hip or buttock at the same time; otherwise, it will be very difficult to find the nerve. In fact, the nerve comes to the surface close to the skin just behind the hip as it does for you. Outside of this location, the nerve goes deep into the muscle fascia and becomes very difficult to visualize and grasp.2.  Note that the efficiency of the procedures is not easily visible as mice show a quasi-normal behavior after the procedure (see Video 8). Nevertheless, as a consequence of the completed procedure (Nerve-cut or Nervecrush), after waking up, mice drag the denervated leg, as can be seen in Video 8. This situation is definitive for the Nerve-cut procedure whereas, in the case of nerve crush procedure, mice recover gradually the movement of the paw, which appears completely normal 3 weeks after the Nerve-crush procedure.()Video 8.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-794","title":"Laser Microirradiation and Real-time Recruitment  Assays  Using  an  Engineered Biosensor","text":"Laser Microirradiation and Real-time Recruitment  Assays  Using  an  Engineered Biosensor\n\n# Abstract\n\nDouble-strand breaks (DSBs) are lesions in DNA that, if not properly repaired, can cause genomic instability, oncogenesis, and cell death. Multiple chromatin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play a role in the DNA damage response to DSBs. Among these, RNF168-mediated ubiquitination of lysines 13 or 15 at the N-terminal tail of histone H2A (H2AK13/15Ub) is essential for the recruitment of effectors of both the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways. Thus, tools and techniques to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of H2AK13/15 ubiquitination at DNA DSBs are important to facilitate studies of DNA repair. Previous work from other groups used the minimal focus-forming region (FFR) of the NHEJ effector 53BP1 to detect H2AK15Ub generated upon damage induced by gamma or laser irradiation in live cells. However, 53BP1- FFR only binds nucleosomes modified with both H2AK15Ub and dimethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me2); thus, 53BP1-FFR does not recognize H2AK13Ub–nucleosomes or nucleosomes that contain H2AK15Ub but lack methylation of H4K20 (H4K20me0). To overcome this limitation, we developed an aviditybased sensor that binds H2AK13/15Ub without dependence on the methylation status of histone H4K20. This sensor, called Reader1.0, detects DNA damage-associated H2AK13/15Ub in live cells with high sensitivity and selectivity. Here, we present a protocol to detect the formation of H2AK13/15Ub at laser-induced DSBs using Reader1.0 as a live-cell reporter for this histone PTM.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 60mm tissue culture dishes (Genesse Scientific, catalog number: 26-260)\n2. 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, catalog number: P35G-1.5-14-C)\n3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-821","title":"Developing Clinically Relevant Acquired Chemoresistance  Models  in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines","text":"Developing Clinically Relevant Acquired Chemoresistance  Models  in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines\n\n# Abstract\n\nChemoresistance, the ability of cancer cells to overcome therapeutic interventions, is an area of active research. Studies on intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance have partly succeeded in elucidating some of the molecular mechanisms in this elusive phenomenon. Hence, drug-resistant cellular models are routinely developed and used to mimic the clinical scenario in-vitro. In an attempt to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that allow ovarian cancer cells to gradually acquire chemoresistance, we have developed isogenic cellular models of cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance (singularly and in combination) over six months, using a clinically relevant modified pulse method. These models serve as important tools to investigate the underlying molecular players, modulation in genetics, epigenetics, and relevant signaling pathways, as well as to understand the role of drug detoxification and drug influx-efflux pathways in development of resistance. These models can also be used as screening tools for new therapeutic molecules. Additionally, repurposing therapeutic agents approved for diseases other than cancer have gained significant attention in improving cancer therapy. To investigate the effect of metformin on acquirement of chemoresistance, we have also developed a combinatorial model of metformin and platinum-taxol, using two different strategies. All these models were subsequently used to study modulation in receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, cancer stem cell functionalities, autophagy, metastasis, metabolic signatures, and various biological processes during development of chemoresistance.

Cell viability was measured by MTT assay at different stages, to estimate the degree of resistance. Development of each model was continued until the cells attained 80–90% viability at the IC_50 dose of the sensitive cells. Morphological changes were observed as the cells gradually acquire resistance (representative images of an early and a late resistant stage of the Metformin-cisplatin-paclitaxel model are shown in Figure 1) (Video 3). FACS analysis was performed to assess the alteration in the cell cycle of resistant cells, whereby representative data of A2780 cisplatin resistant and A2780 paclitaxel resistant models are shown in Figure 2g and 2h. The late resistant cells showed significant increase in G_0.G_1 stage compared to A2780 sensitive cells.()# Figure 1. Morphological changes in cells during development of drug resistance.(a) A2780 sensitive cells; (b) 4^th A2780 sequential Met-Cis-Pac model; (c) 15^thA2780 sequential Met-Cis-Pac model; (d) 4^thA2780 combinatorial Met-Cis-Pac model; (e) 15^th combinatorial Met-Cis-Pac model. The arrows indicate the morphological changes observed at different stages during the acquirement of metformin sequential and combinatorial dual drug resistance. Similarly, the morphological changes have been captured in the form of a video for sensitive, early stage, and late-stage drug resistant cells in the presence and absence of drugs.()# Video 1.

(UT – Untreated, DT- Drug Treated)# A. Development of chemoreistance models against single drug# A1. Paclitaxel resistant models in A2780 or OAW42 cells1.  Depending upon the proliferative rate of each cell line, seed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.2.  After 24h of seeding, treat the cells with either 60nM (for A2780) or 1.77uM (for OAW42) of paclitaxel for 2~h , and then replace them with 4~mL of fresh media. The selection of these exact concentrations of drug for the first treatment was determined by individual IC_50 value calculated for each cell line for ^72h .3. Upon drug treatment, substantial cell death will be observed, which will eventually lead to individual colony formation in a few days. In our case, extensive cell death was seen for both A2780 and OAW42 cells, and individual colonies started growing after a few days. Due to the smaller size of A2780 cells, large colonies in enough numbers took 5-6 days to attain 60–70% confluence. For OAW42 cells, which are relatively larger in size, colonies started merging by three days ( 60-70% confluence).4. Trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in a 100mm dish for the second treatment cycle. To mimic the clinical scenario, we avoided picking up individual clones which might bear differential molecular signature and resistance index.5.  Apply the same dose of paclitaxel again for 2~h , followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60–70% confluence. Again, in our case, we observed cell death and colony formation for both the cell lines.6. Next, trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells for the third treatment cycle of the same dose and allow them to grow in fresh growth medium. Interestingly, from the third treatment cycle onwards, both A2780 and OAW42 cells showed more homogenous growth pattern.7.  Once the cells attain 60–70% confluency, trypsinize the cells and freeze down 50% of them for future use. Reseed the remaining cells for next treatment at incremental doses as mentioned in the Table 1.8.  At this step, seed some cells for MTT to compare their drug sensitivity to the respective sensitive (A2780 or OAW42) cells.9.  For MTT, seed the cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 3,000 cells per well with total volume not exceeding 100~uL .10. Treat the cells with a range of drug concentrations and incubate the plates for ^72h at 37^°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator.11. After the incubation, treat the cells with 20~uL of 5 mg/mL MTT and incubate the plate for ^3~h~ at 37^°C in a 5%CO_2 incubator.12. Remove the media from each of the wells and add 100~uL of DMSO per well, to solubilize the dye.13. Keep the plate in a shaker and incubate for 15min for the dye to dissolve in DMSO. Measure the absorbance of the dye at two different wavelengths 560~nm and 670 nm ). Finally, measure acquirement of resistance in comparison to the IC_50 dose of the respective sensitive cells.Table 1. Paclitaxel concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells.()Note: Subtract the absorbance obtained at 560 nm from the absorbance obtained at 670 nm to negate the background absorbance arising from the presence of DMSO.14. Repeat similar treatment cycles of paclitaxel with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 1 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.15. Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to validate the development of paclitaxel chemoresistance.Note: We performedthis assay at the ^t h , I2^t h , and I3^t h cycles for A2780 cells, and at the g^t h , l l^t h , and I2^t h cycles for OAW42 cells (Figure 2a and 2b).16. Calculate the resistance indices indicating the level of resistance acquired at different stages using the formula: RI=IC_50 value of resistant cells /IC_50 value of control cells()Figure 2. Cell viability assay and cell cycle analysis depicting increase in drug resistance across the different stages of A2780 and OAW42 cells.Cells were treated with IC_50 values of cisplatin or paclitaxel determined for A2780 and OAW42 sensitive cells. (a) Paclitaxel resistant A2780 cells showed 93.1% viability in the 13^th stage of resistance and (b) OAW42 cells showed 95.3% viability in the 12^th stage of resistance. Similarly, (c) cisplatin treated A2780 cells showed 99.3% viability in the 15^th stage and (d) cisplatin treated OAW42 cells showed 90.49% cell viability in the 14^th stage. € A2780 shows approximately 100% cell viability in the 15^th stage of Cis-Pac resistance. Similarly, for (f) OAW42 cells, cell viability was almost 92.9% in the 13^th stage. (g) Cisplatin and paclitaxel late resistant A2780 cells show a significant cell cycle blockade in the G_0-G_1 phase, as compared to A2780 cells.# A2. Cisplatin resistant models in A2780 or OAW42 cells1.  Seed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.2.  After 24h of seeding, treat the cells with either 3.32uM (for A2780) or 1.66uM (for OAW42) of cisplatin for 2h , and then replace with 4mL of fresh media. The selection of these exact concentrations of drug for the first treatment was determined by individual cell line-specific IC_50 values calculated for ^72h .3. Upon drug treatment, substantial cell death will be observed, which will eventually lead to individual colony formation in a few days. In our case, extensive cell death was seen for both A2780 and OAW42 cells and individual colonies started growing after a few days.

Again, in our case, we observed cell death and colony formation for both the cell lines.6. Next, trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells for the third treatment cycle of the same dose and allow them to grow in fresh growth medium. Interestingly, from this point onwards, both A2780 and OAW42 cells showed a more homogenous growth pattern.7.  Once the cells attain 60–70% confluency, trypsinize the cells and freeze down 50% of them for future use. Re-seed the remaining cells for the subsequent treatment at incremental doses as mentioned in the Table 2.Table 2. Cisplatin concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells.()8.  At this step, seed some cells for MTT to compare their drug sensitivity to the respective sensitive (A2780 or OAW42) cells.9.  For MTT, seed the cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 3000 cells per well, with total volume not exceeding 100~uL and follow the steps as mentioned in section A1.10. Repeat similar treatment cycles of cisplatin with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 2 for the rest of both A2780 and OAW42 cells.11. Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to check for the development of cisplatin chemoresistance.Note: We performed MTT at g^t h , I2^t h , and I5^t h cycles for A2780 cells, and at ^t h,G^t h , and I I^t h cycles for OAW42 cells (Figure 2c and 2d).12. Resistance indices for different stages were calculated using the formula: RI=IC_50 value of resistant cells /IC_50 value of control cells# B. Cisplatin and paclitaxel (Cis-Pac) combinatorial resistant model in A2780 and OAW42 cells1.  Seed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.2.  After 24~h of seeding, treat A2780 cells with 3.32~uM cisplatin +~60~nM paclitaxel for 2~h and OAW42 cells in 0.332~uM cisplatin +~0.05~uM paclitaxel for 4~h , and replace it with 4~mL of fresh media. To determine the IC_50 dose of cisplatin in combination with paclitaxel, we prepared a range of serial dilutions surrounding the individual IC_50 value of each drug and tested for both cell lines. This combinatorial IC_50 dose of cisplatin+paclitaxel was used for the first treatment.3.  Upon drug treatment, substantial cell death will be observed, which will eventually lead to individualcolony formation in a few days. In our case, extensive cell death was seen for both A2780 and OAW42 cells and individual colonies started growing after a few days. Due to the smaller size of A2780 cells, large colonies in enough numbers took 5-6 days to attain 60–70% confluence. For OAW42 cells, which are relatively larger in size, colonies started merging by three days 60-70% confluence).4.  Trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in 100 mm dish and for the second treatment cycle. To mimic the clinical scenario, we avoided picking up individual clones which might bear differential molecular signature and resistance index.5. Apply the same dose of cisplatin and paclitaxel again for 2h , followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60–70% confluence. Again, in our case, we observed cell death and colony formation for both the cell lines.6.  Next, trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells for the third treatment cycle of the same dose, and allow them to grow in fresh growth medium.

At this step, seed some cells for MTT to compare their drug sensitivity to the respective sensitive (A2780 or OAW42) cells and perform MTT assay as mentioned in section A1.8.  For the remaining cells once they attain 60–70% confluency, trypsinize them and freeze down 50% of them for future use. Reseed the remaining cells for the subsequent treatment at incremental doses as mentioned in Table 2.9.  Repeat similar treatment cycles of cisplatin and paclitaxel with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 1 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.10. Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to monitor the development of Cis-Pac combinatorial chemoresistance.Note: We performed MTT at I^t h , I2^t h , and I5^t h cycles for A2780 cells, and at ^t h,G^t h , and I3^t h cycles for OAW42 cells (Figure 2e and 2phi .11. Resistance indices for different stages were calculated using the formula: RI=IC_50 value of resistant cells /IC_50 value of control cells.Table 3. Cis-Pac concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells.()# C. Metformin-Cis-Pac resistant models in A2780 or OAW42 cellsType 2 diabetes is known to be associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including ovarian cancer. To better understand the role of metformin (the most commonly prescribed medicine for type 2 diabetes) intervention in acquiring chemoresistance, two different chemo-resistant models were developed in A2780 and OAW42 cells. Due to the lack of any existing study on this aspect, two different strategies were adapted: i. Sequential treatment of cells with metformin for 24h , followed by 2h of cisplatin-paclitaxel treatment, and, ii. Combinatorial metformin treatment along with cisplatin-paclitaxel for two hours.# Sequential Metformin dual drug/Combinatorial Metformin dual drug Resistant model in A2780 and OAW42 cells1.  Seed 1 million A2780 cells or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in a 100mm dish.# For Metformin sequential treatmenta.  Treat the cells with 2~mM metformin ( IC_20 concentration) for 24~h (the IC_50 and IC_20 concentrations of metformin were determined using MTT assay as detailed in Section A1.15 – data not shown).b. Upon completing the metformin pre-treatment, treat the cells with different combinations of cisplatin and paclitaxel concentrations as narrated in Table 3 for 2h , and replace it with 4mL of fresh media.# For Metformin combinatorial treatmentTreat the cells with 2 mM metformin ( IC_20 concentration) ^+ Cis-Pac concentrations for 2h , as mentioned in Table 4.Table 4. Metformin Sequential/Combinatorial drug concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells.(i) Sequential Treatment -2mM Metformin pretreatment for 24h followed by Cis-Pac treatments for 2h as mentioned below. (ii) Combinatorial Treatment -2mM Metformin ^+ Cis-Pac treatments for 2h .()2.  Grow the cells until they attain more than 60–70% confluency before the 2^nd dose. For this model, moderate cell death with homogenous growth was observed after the 1^st treatment.3.  Repeat the second treatment cycle as mentioned above depending on the model, replace the drugs with 4 mL of fresh media, and incubate the cells until they attain 60–70% confluency. Again, homogenous growth with moderate cell death was observed for both cell lines.4.  Trypsinize the cells and freeze down 50% of the cells for future use, and re-seed the remaining cells for the next treatment cycle in a 100mm dish.5.  Seed some cells for MTT assay and perform MTT as described in section A1.6.  For the successive treatment cycles, repeat the steps keeping the metformin dose constant but incrementally increasing the concentrations of Cis-Pac, as mentioned in Table 4.7. Repeat the successive treatment cycles for the development of MSLR and MCLR models, by keeping the metformin dose constant but incrementally increasing the concentrations of Cis-Pac, as mentioned in Table 4.8.  Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to monitor the development of resistance in the sequential and combinatorial metformin dual drug resistant models.Note: We performed MTT assay at I^t h , I2^t h , and I5^t h cycles for A2780 cells, and at ^t h, g^t h , and I3^t h cycles for OAW42 cells (Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d).()Figure 3. Cell viability assay depicting increase in drug resistance across the different stages of A2780 and OAW42 cells.Cells were treated with combination IC_50 values of cisplatin and paclitaxel. (a) In case of sequential metformin dual drug resistant A2780 cells, 97.12% cell viability was observed in the 15^th stage and (b) OAW42 cells showed 81.5% cell viability in the 13^th stage. Similarly, (c) in case of metformin-cisplatin-paclitaxel resistant A2780 cells, 84.80% cell viability was observed in the 15^th stage, and d. OAW42 cells showed 77.6% cell viability in the 13^th stage.# APPLICATION:The development of the abovementioned chemo-resistant models has led us to comprehend the differential modulations of various key molecules in the early vs. late stages of chemoresistance. Our study demonstrated that the early resistant (cisplatin, or paclitaxel, or Cis-Pac) cells possess upregulated insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) expression, which declines at late resistant stages (Singh et al., 2014; Dhadve et al., 2020). The late resistant model showed high AKT activation for both the cell lines, irrespective of the nature of the drugs. Such pulsatory nature of IGF1R signaling regulates the differential level of cancer stem cell population, and their functionalities and differential autophagic flux at different stages of resistance (Singh et al., 2016; Bishnu et al., 2021). Using these models, we have also shown the ability of metformin to act as a chemosensitizer, leading to the impediment of chemoresistance by reducing the cancer stem cell-like population (Bishnu et al., 2019). We believe that these chemo-resistant models have wide potential to study intricate molecular signatures and assess the therapeutic relevance of molecules that can be selectively targeted at different stages of chemoresistance, and can also be widely adapted to other cancer cell lines.# RecipesDrug Stock Concentrations and Storage Instructions:Cisplatin: Freshly prepare 33.3mM 0mug/uL) stock solution in DMSO at the time of treatment.Paclitaxel: Prepare 11.71mM (10ug/uL) stock solution in DMSO and store in -20^°C .Metformin: Prepare 1M stock solution in DMEM and store in 4^°C .\n\n# Outline\n\n## Overview of Chemoresistance Models\nA2780 and OAW42 cells were treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin individually and in combination with incrementing doses.\nCell viability was measured by MTT assay at different stages to estimate the degree of resistance.\nDevelopment of each model was continued until the cells attained 80–90% viability at the IC_50 dose of the sensitive cells.\n## Development of Chemoresistance Models Against Single Drug\n## Paclitaxel Resistant Models in A2780 or OAW42 Cells\nSeed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.\nTreat the cells with either 60nM (for A2780) or 1.77uM (for OAW42) of paclitaxel for 2h, and then replace them with 4mL of fresh media.\nTrypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in a 100mm dish for the second treatment cycle.\nApply the same dose of paclitaxel again for 2h, followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60–70% confluence.\nRepeat similar treatment cycles of paclitaxel with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 1 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.\n## Cisplatin Resistant Models in A2780 or OAW42 Cells\nSeed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.\nTreat the cells with either 3.32uM (for A2780) or 1.66uM (for OAW42) of cisplatin for 2h, and then replace with 4mL of fresh media.\nTrypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in 100mm dish for the second treatment cycle.\nApply the same dose of cisplatin again for 2h, followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60–70% confluence.\nRepeat similar treatment cycles of cisplatin with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 2 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.\n## Cisplatin and Paclitaxel (Cis-Pac) Combinatorial Resistant Model in A2780 and OAW42 Cells\nSeed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100mm dishes.\nTreat A2780 cells with 3.32uM cisplatin + 60nM paclitaxel for 2h and OAW42 cells with 0.332uM cisplatin + 0.05uM paclitaxel for 4h, and replace it with 4mL of fresh media.\nTrypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in 100mm dish and for the second treatment cycle.\nApply the same dose of cisplatin and paclitaxel again for 2h, followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60–70% confluence.\nRepeat similar treatment cycles of cisplatin and paclitaxel with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 3 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.\n## Metformin-Cis-Pac Resistant Models in A2780 or OAW42 Cells\n## Sequential Metformin Dual Drug/Combinatorial Metformin Dual Drug Resistant Model in A2780 and OAW42 Cells\nSeed 1 million A2780 cells or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in a 100mm dish.\nTreat the cells with 2mM metformin (IC_20 concentration) for 24h, followed by 2h of cisplatin-paclitaxel treatment.\nGrow the cells until they attain more than 60–70% confluency before the 2nd dose.\nRepeat the second treatment cycle as mentioned above depending on the model, replace the drugs with 4 mL of fresh media, and incubate the cells until they attain 60–70% confluency.\n## Combinatorial Metformin Treatment Along with Cisplatin-Paclitaxel\nTreat the cells with 2mM metformin (IC_20 concentration) + Cis-Pac concentrations for 2h, as mentioned in Table 4.\nGrow the cells until they attain more than 60–70% confluency before the 2nd dose.\nRepeat the second treatment cycle as mentioned above depending on the model, replace the drugs with 4 mL of fresh media, and incubate the cells until they attain 60–70% confluency.\n## MTT Assay\nSeed the cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 3000 cells per well, with total volume not exceeding 100uL.\nTreat the cells with a range of drug concentrations and incubate the plates for 72h at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator.\nAfter the incubation, treat the cells with 20uL of 5 mg/mL MTT and incubate the plate for 3h at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator.\nRemove the media from each of the wells and add 100uL of DMSO per well, to solubilize the dye.\nKeep the plate in a shaker and incubate for 15min for the dye to dissolve in DMSO.\n## Calculation of Resistance Indices\nCalculate the resistance indices indicating the level of resistance acquired at different stages using the formula: RI=IC_50 value of resistant cells / IC_50 value of control cells.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Pharmacology & Drug Development"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-854","title":"Isolation of Mitochondria from Ustilago maydis Protoplasts","text":"Isolation of Mitochondria from Ustilago maydis Protoplasts\n\n# Abstract\n\nUstilago maydis, a basidiomycete that infects Zea mays, is one of the top ten fungal models for studying DNA repair, signal transduction pathways, and dimorphic transitions, among other processes. From a metabolic point of view, U. maydis lacks fermentative capacity, pointing to mitochondria as a key player in central metabolism. Oxidative phosphorylation, synthesis of heme groups, Krebs cycle,  -oxidation of fatty acids, and synthesis of amino acids are some of the processes that take place in mitochondria. Given the importance of this organelle in eukaryotic cells in general, and in fungal cells in particular, we present a protocol for the isolation of U. maydis mitochondria based on the enzymatic disruption of U. maydis cell wall and differential centrifugation. The method can easily be extrapolated to other fungal species, by using appropriate lytic enzymes.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Sterile toothpick\n2.

Streak the U. maydis strain from a 25% glycerol stock (maintained at -70^°C ) on solid YPD agar (Yeast extract, Peptone, Dextrose; see Recipe 7), incubate for 1-2 days at 28^°C , and then store the plate at 4^°C .2.  Select a colony with a sterile toothpick.3.  Culture cells at 28^°C and 180 rpm in 100~m L of YPD medium for 18-24 h .4.  Inoculate cells in ^11 of YPD liquid medium (at an initial optical density at 600n m=0.04=9x 10^5 cells/mL) and incubate for ^24~h~ at 28^°C/180 rpm. The incubation time and culture media should be adjusted to your specific needs.5.  Collect the cells using a pre-weighed 500~mL centrifuge bottle. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3,800× g and 4^°C in the FiberliteTM F12-6×500 LEX. Remove supernatant, suspend the cells in distilled water, and repeat the centrifugation step. Decant the supernatant.6.  Measure the wet weight of the pellet, and add 12.5mL of solution A per gram of wet weight. Use a glass or Teflon rod to suspend the cells. At this stage, cells can be vortexed to disperse cell aggregates. Transfer the cell suspension to a glass beaker. Add 0.0169 of the T. harzianum lysing enzymes per gram of wet weight. Gently mix with a Teflon or glass rod, and incubate for30-60 min at 30^°C in a water bath.7.  To check the formation of protoplasts, shake the cell suspension every 10m i n , withdraw 20~uL of the suspension, and mix with 980~uL of distilled water. Measure the optical density at 600n m (Figure 1A). Due to the osmotic shock, cells without a cell wall burst, and their content are released to the medium. This results in a decrease in the optical density of the suspension. When the optical density reaches its minimal value, the formation of protoplasts is complete. Note: From this step, all procedures should be carried out at 4^°C .8.  Centrifuge the suspension at 3,800× g at 4^°C for 5 min to recover the protoplasts. Decant the supernatant.9.  Add 12.5mL of cold solution B per gram of initial wet weight, to wash the lysing enzymes. With a Teflon or glass rod, carefully suspend the protoplasts. Do not use the vortex to disperse theprotoplasts. Then, centrifuge the suspension for 10 min at 3,800×g and 4^°C . The new pellet should be compact.B.  Mitochondria isolation1.  Transfer the pellet of protoplasts to a Teflon pestle homogenizer and add cold solution C (40 m L/25-30  of the initial wet weight of cells) containing the complete cocktail of protease inhibitors plus PMSF (1 mM final concentration).2.  Attach the Teflon pestle to the electric drill. Connect the drill to the variable autotransformer (rheostat), select an output intensity of 40, and homogenize for 20 cycles. Avoid the formation of foam and bubbles.3.  After homogenization, bring the volume to 130~m L with cold solution C (containing protease inhibitors), transfer the suspension to 50mL polycarbonate tubes, and eliminate cell debris and nuclei by centrifuging at 3,800× g and 4^°C for 10 min.4.  Recover the supernatant from the polycarbonate tubes and centrifuge at 17,000× g and 4^°C for 10 m i n . Carefully decant the supernatant. Then, with the buffer remaining in the tube and with the help of a soft paintbrush (number 8 or 12, according to the biomass), suspend the mitochondrial pellet. Keep mitochondria at 4^°C for same-day experiments, or at -70^°C to be used later.5.  Determine the protein concentration of your sample by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). Prepare a stock solution of 1~mg/mL BSA and construct a standard curve in the range of 5 to 100u protein. Dilute the sample tenfold using 0.4% sodium deoxycholate solution, and use 5- 10~uL of the diluted sample for protein determination.# C.  Oxygen consumptionTo measure the respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria in a thermostated chamber with magnetic stirring, use a Clark-type oxygen electrode coupled to a YSI5300A biologic oxygen monitor. 1.  Bring the thermostated chamber, the solutions D and E, and the distilled water to 30^°C .2.  Pour 1.135mL of distilled water, 65uL of solution D (final concentration 50m M ), and 100~uL of solution E (final concentration 20~m M ) in the chamber with magnetic stirring. Adjust the signal to 100% , which corresponds to the dissolved oxygen.3.  Add 5-10uL of isolated mitochondria; wait until the signal is stabilized and then stimulate oxygen consumption by adding 10~m M succinate (13 µL from 1 M stock solution), or 0.15~m M NADH (9.8 µL from 20m M stock solution).4. To inhibit respiratory complex IV, add 0.5 mM KCN (2.6 µL from 0.25 M stock solution), or 2uM n-octyl gallate (1.3 µL from 2 mM stock solution), to inhibit the alternative oxidase5.  Wash the chamber with distilled water before adding new media.6.  Calculate the specific activity by dividing the oxygen consumption slope by the amount of protein (mg) or the dry weight (g).D.  Mitochondrial membrane potential assay1.  Turn on the Olis Modernized AmincoTM DW-2 spectrophotometer and allow the lamp to warm up for 30~m i n . Select the dual-beam option, and adjust the wavelengths of monochromator 1 (MONO1) to 511 n m , and of MONO2 to 533 nm. In the dual-beam mode, the sample is illuminated with two different wavelengths, one corresponding to the reference wavelength and the other to the measuring wavelength. The output corresponds to the electronic subtraction of the absorbance at 511 nm minus the absorbance at 533n m .2.  Transfer 2.7mL of solution F into a 3.7mL glass cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer. Start the magnetic stirring. Add 2~uM safranine (5.4~uL from 1 mM stock solution) and then the mitochondrial sample 0.5-1.0 mg protein). Place the cuvette in the spectrophotometer and close the cover.3.  Adjust the baseline and add, through a small hole made in the chamber cover, the substrate of your interest (for example, 10m M of succinate, or 0.15 mM NADH) with a Hamilton syringe.4.  To collapse the membrane potential generated by succinate or any other respiratory substrate, add 2-10~uM FCCP.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Protoplast Preparation\n## Streaking and Incubation\nStreak the U. maydis strain from a 25% glycerol stock on solid YPD agar and incubate for 1-2 days at 28°C.\nStore the plate at 4°C.\n## Cell Culture\nSelect a colony with a sterile toothpick.\nCulture cells at 28°C and 180 rpm in 100 mL of YPD medium for 18-24 hours.\nInoculate cells in 1 L of YPD liquid medium and incubate for 24 hours at 28°C/180 rpm.\n## Cell Collection and Washing\nCollect the cells using a pre-weighed 500 mL centrifuge bottle.\nCentrifuge for 5 minutes at 3,800×g and 4°C, remove supernatant, suspend the cells in distilled water, and repeat the centrifugation step.\n## Protoplast Formation\nMeasure the wet weight of the pellet and add 12.5 mL of solution A per gram of wet weight.\nAdd 0.0169 of the T. harzianum lysing enzymes per gram of wet weight, gently mix, and incubate for 30-60 minutes at 30°C.\nCheck the formation of protoplasts by measuring the optical density at 600 nm.\n## Protoplast Recovery\nCentrifuge the suspension at 3,800×g at 4°C for 5 minutes to recover the protoplasts.\nAdd 12.5 mL of cold solution B per gram of initial wet weight to wash the lysing enzymes.\nCentrifuge the suspension for 10 minutes at 3,800×g and 4°C.\n## Mitochondria Isolation\n## Homogenization\nTransfer the pellet of protoplasts to a Teflon pestle homogenizer and add cold solution C.\nHomogenize for 20 cycles using an electric drill.\n## Cell Debris Removal\nBring the volume to 130 mL with cold solution C and transfer the suspension to 50 mL polycarbonate tubes.\nCentrifuge at 3,800×g and 4°C for 10 minutes to eliminate cell debris and nuclei.\n## Mitochondrial Pellet Recovery\nRecover the supernatant and centrifuge at 17,000×g and 4°C for 10 minutes.\nSuspend the mitochondrial pellet in the remaining buffer using a soft paintbrush.\n## Protein Concentration Determination\nDetermine the protein concentration of the sample using the Lowry method.\nPrepare a stock solution of 1 mg/mL BSA and construct a standard curve.\n## Oxygen Consumption Measurement\n## Chamber Preparation\nBring the thermostated chamber, solutions D and E, and distilled water to 30°C.\nPour 1.135 mL of distilled water, 65 μL of solution D, and 100 μL of solution E into the chamber.\n## Mitochondrial Addition and Oxygen Consumption Measurement\nAdd 5-10 μL of isolated mitochondria and wait until the signal is stabilized.\nStimulate oxygen consumption by adding 10 mM succinate or 0.15 mM NADH.\nInhibit respiratory complex IV by adding 0.5 mM KCN or 2 μM n-octyl gallate.\n## Calculation of Specific Activity\nCalculate the specific activity by dividing the oxygen consumption slope by the amount of protein or dry weight.\n## Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay\n## Spectrophotometer Preparation\nTurn on the Olis Modernized Aminco DW-2 spectrophotometer and allow the lamp to warm up for 30 minutes.\nSelect the dual-beam option and adjust the wavelengths of monochromator 1 and 2.\n## Sample Preparation and Measurement\nTransfer 2.7 mL of solution F into a 3.7 mL glass cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer.\nAdd 2 μM safranine and the mitochondrial sample, and place the cuvette in the spectrophotometer.\nAdjust the baseline and add the substrate of interest using a Hamilton syringe.\n## Membrane Potential Collapse\nAdd 2-10 μM FCCP to collapse the membrane potential generated by succinate or other respiratory substrates.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Cell Biology & Culture"}}

Here, we describe an updated and extended version of our RNA purification and protein identification (RaPID) protocol for the pulldown of aptamer-tagged mRNAs by affinity purification. The method takes advantage of the high affinity interaction between the MS2 RNA aptamer and the MS2 coat protein (MCP), as well as that between streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) and streptavidin. Thus, it employs MCP-SBP fusions to affinity purify MS2-tagged target RNAs of interest over immobilized streptavidin. Purified aptamer-tagged mRNAs, along with any associated RNAs and proteins, are then sent for RNA sequencing (RaPID-seq) or mass spectrometry (RaPID-MS), which allows for the identification of bound cohort RNAs and proteins, respectively.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# A.

Addition of the SBP moiety allows for the pulldown of MCP-GFP using immobilized streptavidin. However, to identify nonspecific signals during the pull-down experiments several controls are needed, such as untagged cells and cells tagged with a control mRNA.1.  Tag the gene of interest with MS2 aptamer a multiple binding sites for the RNA-binding MS2 coat  protein  (MCP),  using  a  PCR-based  genomic-tagging  strategy  and  homologous recombination as previously described (Haim et al., 2007; Haim-Vilmovsky and Gerst, 2009). See also Note 1.2.  Transform the strain having the gene tagged with MS2 aptamer with plasmids expressing the MCP-GFP-SBP using standard yeast LiOAc transformation (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007), and plate on SC-His synthetic media agarose plate.3.  Pick a single colony that has been transformed with MS2-CP-GFP-SBP containing the HIS3 selection marker, inoculate it into a 50-m L test tube with 7-8 m L of selective medium (SC-His), and grow in a shaking incubator at 30^°C for 6-10  h .4.  Dilute to 500~mL culture for an overnight culture. For cells at mid-logarithmic phase, the final O D_600 the next morning should be between 0.4-0.8. Cultures at different OD600 values can be used if other cell states are required, but further steps may need modification according to the amount of cells obtained. To calculate the starter culture volume to take, follow these steps:a.  Measure the cell number or OD600 of a culture and determine the doubling time using the formula below. For the wild-type strain (BY4741) used in this experiment, the doubling time was ^2h .og_10(N_t/N_0)/lo g_10(2)=g g – number of generations N0 – # of cells or O D_600 at start Nt – # of cells or O D_600 at the end = time cultured d – doubling time ( d= t/ g)b.  Determine the amount of starter culture to add to a larger, overnight culture using this formula:N_0-O D_600 at which to startN_t-O D_600 that you want at the endg – number of generations the culture will go through before harvestingeginarraylN_0=N_t/2^g g=t/dendarray5.  After overnight growth, measure absorbance of the culture and, if needed, keep growing the culture at least up to O D_600=0.4 . Collect the cells by centrifugation at 1,100× g for 5 min at 4^°C , using a SLA3000-type rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge, and discard the growth medium.6.  Resuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting (do not vortex) in 200~mL of fresh growth medium lacking methionine, transfer to 1 L flask, and incubate at 30^°C for 45 min with shaking to induce the expression of the MS2-CP-GFP-SBP. See also Note 2.7.  Fix the cells with formaldehyde by directly adding 270 uL of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 0.05% , and incubate at room temperature (RT) with slow shaking for 10m i n .8.  Terminate the cross-linking reaction by adding 25mL of glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubate for an additional 2 min.9.  Centrifuge the cells, discard the supernatant according to chemical waste procedures at your institute, and resuspend the cells using a pipette (do not vortex) in 10~m L of PBS in a 50~m L tube.10. Centrifuge the cells at 2,500× g for 5 min at 4^°C .11. Discard the PBS completely and keep the tube inverted for 1-2 min on tissue paper to remove residual PBS.12. Quickly freeze the cell pellet using liquid nitrogen. For storage, transfer the cells to a -80^°C freezer. The cells may be stored for prolonged periods under these conditions.# B.  Yeast Cell LysisNote: All the steps mentioned below should be performed on ice.1.  Place the frozen cell pellet on ice and thaw by adding 4mL of complete yeast lysis buffer.2.  Once the cells are thawed, transfer 0.7~mL into 1.5~m L microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with a volume of 0.5mL of acid-prewashed and oven-baked glass beads.3.  Vortex the cells using the disruptor for 20 m i n at 4^°C at maximum speed. Turn off the shaker and let stand for 5 min to prevent excessive heating, then turn on for an additional 20m i n .4.  Centrifuge microfuge tubes in a bench-top centrifuge precooled to 4^°C at 1,000× g for 2 min. Transfer the supernatant into fresh microfuge tubes, and centrifuge again at 15,000×g for 10m i n .5.  Collect the supernatants from each sample (i.e., each individual culture) into disposable 15 mL test tubes. Around 4~m L of supernatant is obtained after centrifugation. Measure the protein concentration with the BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.6.  Transfer the total amount of protein extract desired for RaPID-seq/MS (typically 80-100 mg per pulldown are used for an RaPID-seq or RaPID-MS experiment, whereas 5-10~m g are used for simple pulldowns for qRT-PCR or Western analysis) to a fresh 15~m L tube, add the avidin solution ( 10u of avidin per 1 mg of protein extract), and incubate at 4^°C for 1h with constant rotation/shaking. This step is done to block any biotinylated protein from binding to the streptavidin beads. See Notes 3 and 4 regarding protein measurements and the required amounts for each type of experiment.7.  Separate the amounts desired for the isolation of RNA and protein into different tubes. In addition, place aside two tubes, each with 1% of initial amount of total extract. One tube is used for “input RNA” (proceed to Step 14 for RNA isolation), and can be used to normalize for gene expression when performing either qRT-PCR or Nanostring experiments (see Note 5). The other tube will be used for “input protein” (proceed to Step 15). These samples are kept on ice and processed in parallel to the eluate, or can be kept frozen at -80^°C until used.8.  In parallel, aliquot 30~uL of streptavidin-conjugated beads. Wash the beads twice by adding1 mL of ice-cold PBS; once in lysis buffer, swirl (do not vortex) 2-3 times, and centrifuge at 1,000 × g . Block the beads for 1h at 4^°C with 2% BSA and tRNA (0.1 mg per 100~uL of beads) prepared in lysis buffer. After 1h , centrifuge and wash once with lysis buffer.9.  Discard the buffer from the washed beads, add the avidin-blocked total cell extract to the beads along with 0.1 mg of yeast tRNA, and incubate at 4^°C for ^2h to overnight with constant rotation.10. Centrifuge the tubes at 1,000× g for 2 min and remove the supernatant. Transfer the beads to 1.7~mL tubes and wash them three times with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer, with centrifugation (as above) between washes.11. Perform a last wash in ice-cold PBS and remove the excess buffer.12. Add 150~uL of the biotin elution solution to the beads, and incubate for 1h at 4^°C with rotation, for elution of the mRNA-protein/RNA complexes from the beads.13. Centrifuge at 1,000× g for 2m i n , transfer the eluate into a fresh microfuge tube, centrifuge once again, and transfer the eluate into a new tube to assure that no beads were carried over.14. To reverse crosslink the fraction destined for RNA isolation, add an equal volume of the crosslink reversal buffer to the eluate and incubate at 70^°C for 45m i n .15. To reverse crosslink the fraction destined for protein isolation, add an appropriate volume of the 5× protein sample buffer to reach the × concentration, and incubate at 70^°C for 45m i n .16. De-crosslinked RNA and protein samples can be kept at -20^°C .\n\n# Outline\n\n## MS2 Tagging and Growing the Yeast Cell Culture\nTag the gene of interest with MS2 aptamer using a PCR-based genomic-tagging strategy and homologous recombination.\nTransform the strain having the gene tagged with MS2 aptamer with plasmids expressing the MCP-GFP-SBP using standard yeast LiOAc transformation.\nPick a single colony that has been transformed with MS2-CP-GFP-SBP containing the HIS3 selection marker, inoculate it into a 50-mL test tube with 7-8 mL of selective medium, and grow in a shaking incubator at 30°C for 6-10 hours.\n## Dilute and Grow the Culture\nDilute to 500 mL culture for an overnight culture.\nFor cells at mid-logarithmic phase, the final OD600 the next morning should be between 0.4-0.8.\n## Calculate Starter Culture Volume\nMeasure the cell number or OD600 of a culture and determine the doubling time.\nDetermine the amount of starter culture to add to a larger, overnight culture.\nAfter overnight growth, measure absorbance of the culture and, if needed, keep growing the culture at least up to OD600 = 0.4.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the growth medium.\nResuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting in 200 mL of fresh growth medium lacking methionine, transfer to 1 L flask, and incubate at 30°C for 45 min with shaking to induce the expression of the MS2-CP-GFP-SBP.\nFix the cells with formaldehyde by directly adding 270 μL of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 0.05%, and incubate at room temperature with slow shaking for 10 min.\nTerminate the cross-linking reaction by adding 25 mL of glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 M, and incubate for an additional 2 min.\nCentrifuge the cells, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells using a pipette in 10 mL of PBS in a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the PBS completely and keep the tube inverted for 1-2 min on tissue paper to remove residual PBS.\nQuickly freeze the cell pellet using liquid nitrogen.\n## Yeast Cell Lysis\nPlace the frozen cell pellet on ice and thaw by adding 4 mL of complete yeast lysis buffer.\nOnce the cells are thawed, transfer 0.7 mL into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with a volume of 0.5 mL of acid-prewashed and oven-baked glass beads.\nVortex the cells using the disruptor for 20 min at 4°C at maximum speed.\nCentrifuge microfuge tubes in a bench-top centrifuge precooled to 4°C at 1,000 × g for 2 min.\nCollect the supernatants from each sample into disposable 15 mL test tubes.\nMeasure the protein concentration with the BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n## Block Biotinylated Proteins\nTransfer the total amount of protein extract desired for RaPID-seq/MS to a fresh 15 mL tube.\nAdd the avidin solution and incubate at 4°C for 1 hour with constant rotation/shaking.\nSeparate the amounts desired for the isolation of RNA and protein into different tubes.\n## Prepare Streptavidin-Conjugated Beads\nAliquot 30 μL of streptavidin-conjugated beads.\nWash the beads twice by adding 1 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nBlock the beads for 1 hour at 4°C with 2% BSA and tRNA prepared in lysis buffer.\nDiscard the buffer from the washed beads, add the avidin-blocked total cell extract to the beads, and incubate at 4°C for 2 hours to overnight with constant rotation.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,000 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nTransfer the beads to 1.7 mL tubes and wash them three times with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer.\nPerform a last wash in ice-cold PBS and remove the excess buffer.\n## Elute mRNA-Protein/RNA Complexes\nAdd 150 μL of the biotin elution solution to the beads.\nIncubate for 1 hour at 4°C with rotation.\n## Reverse Crosslinking\nAdd an equal volume of the crosslink reversal buffer to the eluate and incubate at 70°C for 45 min for RNA isolation.\nAdd an appropriate volume of the 5 × protein sample buffer to reach the desired concentration, and incubate at 70°C for 45 min for protein isolation.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Molecular Biology Techniques"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-875","title":"Label-free Quantification of Direct Protein-protein Interactions with Backscattering","text":"Label-free Quantification of Direct Protein-protein Interactions with Backscattering\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe functional performance of a cell depends on how macromolecules, in particular proteins, come together in a precise orientation, how they assemble into protein complexes and interact with each other. In order to study protein-protein interactions at a molecular level, a variety of methods to investigate these binding processes yield affinity constants and/or the identification of binding regions. There are several well-established biophysical techniques for biomolecular interaction studies, such as fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. Although these techniques have been proven to be efficient, they either need labeling or immobilization of one interaction partner. Backscattering interferometry (BSI) is a label-free detection method, which allows label- and immobilization-free interaction analysis under physiologically relevant conditions with high sensitivity and in small volumes. We used BSI to measure the interaction of the neuronal calcium sensor recoverin with its target G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) as a model system. Increasing concentrations of purified recoverin were mixed with a specific concentration of a GRK1 fusion protein. In this protocol, we provide a full description of the instrumental setup, data acquisition, and evaluation. Equilibrium dissociation constants of recoverin-GRK1 interaction determined by the BSI instrumental setup are in full agreement with affinity constants obtained by different methods as described in the literature.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Schematic structure of device setup and componentsThe BSI system consists of a microfluidic chip, a HeNe laser, a mirror, and a CCD camera. These components are positioned and connected as illustrated in Figure 2. The position of each component and its distance to other components is crucial for the BSI setup, allowing the recording of the signals originating from protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. Fixed positions are indicated by red boxes. It is important to keep the components in these positions at the right distances, whereas the positions of the blue boxes are optional and can be flexibly adjusted.()# Figure 2. Schematic structure of BSI instrument setup.Boxes in red and blue represent the position of each device component representing fixed and flexible positions, respectively. Numbers correspond to device components as listed below.Components shown in Figures 2 and 3:1. The table is 24×36 inches.2. Laser3. The point where laser leaves the cable4. Chip holder5.

Photograph of the actual setup for the BSI instrument displaying various components at their exact position.Numbers in yellow indicate the setup position as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the actual setup for the BSI instrument displaying the exact position and distances for each component.# B.  Device preparation1.  In order to start sample measurements, device assembling and preparation are important and should be done very accurately to avoid any erroneous signals that do not originate from biomolecular interactions.2.  Turn on the laser at least three hours before starting the experiment. During these three hours, either prepare the device or prepare the samples. It is recommended to prepare the device a day before doing the actual experiments. If possible, also prepare your samples a day before.3.  The chip holder is temperature sensitive which allows choosing the temperature for the experiments. Turn on the temperature device, which is usually set to 25^°C . It will take a few minutes until the temperature reaches 25^°C (shown in Figure 4).()# Figure 4. Temperature controller.A temperature controller is used to set the temperature for the microfluidic chip. Experiments can be performed at any desired temperatures.4.  Chip cleaning: The chip for BSI is a special microfluidic device that contains five flow channels (Figure 5). Chip cleaning is crucial as the laser beam directly shines on the chip surface and reflects back to the mirror. High concentrations of an alkaline or acid solution (1 M KOH or 1 M HCl) can be used to clean the chip. Only a few microliters of these solutions are recommended to use at once, followed by 70% ethanol and cleaning with an excess of water. The chip should never be touched by bare hands, always use gloves to hold the chip, and use lens cleaning paper towels to wipe and swipe the chip.()# Figure 5. Chip for BSI.The chip is shown after cleaning. It has five flow cells and each of them can be used for measurements.5.  Chip drying: There are two ways to dry the cleaned chip: manually, by blowing in some air onto the chip surface with a piece of paper (Do not blow air from the mouth. A suction device can suck excessive water left inside flow channels), or using commercial dryers (e.g., Druckluftsprayfrom Caramba).6.  After drying the chip, place the chip inside chip holder. Fix the chip inside the chip holder with extreme care. There are two stages of chip fixing (Figure 6A). In the initial stage, place the chip inside the holder and tighten the metal screws. Second, special small screws made of plastic are used to fix the chip itself, so it does not move. The laser beam should directly point to the selected flow cell. To do so, you can adjust the laser signal by using adjusting screws shown in Figure 6B.()# Figure 6. Microfluidic chip device setup.(A) Fixing of the chip inside the holder. The silver screws are fixed first followed by fixing the red plastic screws. Handle with extreme care as they touch the chip directly. (B) The chip holder indicating where the chip and adjusting screws for laser positioning are placed.7.  Connect the flow cell to the suction vacuum pump right after fixing the chip in the chip holder. A small-sized plastic cable is connected to the suction vacuum pump, which can be turned ON/OFF using a regulatory switch, marked as 11b (shown in Figures 2 and 3). A small red tube (Figure 7) is directly placed inside the opening of one of the flow cells of your choice. Fix it firmly. Take a 10ul pipette filled with water and place the pipette tip inside the opening of the flow cell. Check whether the water from the pipette is sucked out by the vacuum tube that was attached. If not, adjust the positions and/or try other channels until it works. Connecting the flow cell to the vacuum pump can be the most challenging task for a successful BSI setup. So, care and patience are of the utmost importance for this step. Figure 7 shows the successful connection of the flow cell to the vacuum pump.()# Figure 7. Vacuum pump connection to the microfluidic chip device.The connecting tube shows the connection to the chip flow cell inside the chip.8.  Maintain the pump pressure by adjusting the position of the connecting cable to the flow cell in the chip. Sometimes the pump sucks the samples from the flow cell very fast and sometimes too slow. Find a balanced pressure by trying gently.9.  To set the signals, fill the flow cell with the buffer that you will use to prepare your samples. For signal measurement, the laser beams onto the mirror (yellow arrow in Figure 8) and is directly reflected to the flow cell (yellow arrow in Figure 8), where it is reflected back to the mirror and finally to the CCD camera (red arrows in Figure 8). Molecular interactions occurring in protein samples loaded in the flow cell influence the reflective angle of the laser beam. Signals monitored by the CCD camera are displayed in the form of fringe patterns, which are further processed by the BSI software. An example of a fringe pattern is shown in Figure 9.()# Figure 8. Indication of laser path.The laser source is where the finger pointed to. A laser beam (indicated by a yellow arrow) shines onto a mirror (white round-shaped device), where it is reflected and shines onto the chip. After reflecting back to the mirror (path shown in red). it finally reaches the CCD camera, which is covered with a piece of paper in this image.()Fringe pattern# Figure 9. Fringe patterns from CCD camera.The red dots represent the fringe pattern, which is displayed on the CCD camera.10. Fringe pattern readout: BSI software is used to readout fringe patterns, which change depending on the changes of reflecting conditions in the flow cell originating from biomolecular interactions. Signal differences can be detected down to nanomolar protein concentrations.11. Selection of fringes: fringes are represented in the form of oscillating peaks (Figure 10) and the desired peaks are manually selected. Each peak corresponds to one point in the fringe pattern. Following aspects should be considered while selecting fringes.a.  The amplitude of the peaks should possibly be equal and peaks with a smaller amplitude (less than 2000 intensity units, Figure 10, upper part) should be excluded from further processing. Suitable peaks of high contrast exhibit sharp edges, are Gaussian-shaped, equally spaced, and are less noisy (Bornhop et al., 2016). Intensities should be equal (see Fringe selection in Figure 10, upper part).b.  If possible, five peaks should be selected, and these peaks will represent your data points during measurement.12. The middle black window in Figure 10 indicates the Fourier transformation. Set the margins as indicated by red, green, and white lanes in Figure 10 (display in the middle).()Figure 10. Snapshot of the software required for controlling the signal measurements.The signal measurement is controlled through the recording software. Three black windows are shown here. From the upper black window, we select the peaks which are representations of fringe patterns. The image in the bottom black window shows a direct phase change (indicated by a red arrow in the left side of the image), which will change during protein-protein interactions. This phase change signal is also displayed in numbers, which can be seen in the right part of the image below “Ratios” and is indicated as “phase’’.13. The values for the ratios should ideally be >2.5 and <3.8 , and both values in the ratio should be nearly identical.14. The bottom window is used for determining the phase change. Some fluctuations in the phase change signal can be observed. The smallest possible change should be in the range of 0.01. The phase change is reported in the unit of Rad. Figure 11 shows a flow diagram of the stepby-step protocol for signal recording.()Step 2 - Fourier transformation()# Figure 11. Flow diagram showing single steps of signal recording.This figure is the step-by-step representation of Figure 10, showing the signal recording steps in a schematic manner. In step 1, the fringes between red and yellow lines are selected. Step 2 is the Fourier transformation. Step 3 represents the ratio adjustment that is directly controlled from the signal and the instrument setup. Step 4 is the phase selection. The last step is the final phase change measurement.# C.  Sample preparations (Figure 12)1.  Recoverin and GRK1 expression and purification were performed according to Abbas (Abbas et al., 2019).2.  Use lyophilized wild-type recoverin, N-terminus of GRK1 (first 25 amino acids) fused to GST, and only GST as a negative control. Measure the protein concentration of your samples (e.g., Bradford, 1976). See Abbas and Koch (2020) for general tips in protein quantification using the Bradford method.3.  Prepare samples with increasing concentration of recoverin (for example from 0uM to 30uM, and add a specific amount of the GST fusion protein (3 to 4uM ). Keep the total volume of eachCopyright  2021 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.sample from 100 to 150~ul . For the background control, use only GST and prepare the sample in the same way. Figure 12 shows the sample preparation strategy.()Figure 12. Scheme showing the experimental design of a protein-protein interaction study using BSI.Proteins for the background (reference) control and protein samples for positive binding signals are prepared in advance. In the present example, the reference control measurement is performed with recoverin and GST (the fusion part of the GRK1 fusion construct). The positive binding signal (sample signal) will originate from the interaction of recoverin with GST-NRK25 (shown in green). After subtracting the background control signal (reference) from the sample signal, the phase change of the resulting sample value (in mRad) is plotted as a function of increasing recoverin concentration.# D.  Record signal1.  Start with cleaning the working bench and ensuring there is a sonicator placed near the BSI while performing your experiment.2.  Perform the measurements in a dark room (Figure 13), as the presence of light can distort the laser signal and influence its stability. Use a headlight while loading the sample onto the flow cell. Keep four 10ul pipette sets with you and a box full of 10ul pipette tips. Set all the pipettes to 10ul .3.  Start with the negative control or reference sample measurements to save some time. Take the pipette with a filled tip and position it into the opening of the flow cell; due to pump pressure, it will start sucking the sample directly from the pipette tip without releasing it. As the sample will pass from the flow cell, use the switch control b to quickly turn off the outward flow from the flow cell. By doing so, the sample will stay inside the flow cell unless the flow cell is opened again using the switch control 11b (Figures 2 and 3). Keep the control switch 11b in the left hand whileloading the sample.4.  As the microfluidic device is directly under the mirror, which is placed to reflect the laser beam towards the CCD camera, avoid changing the position of the mirror by bringing it into contact with the pipette.5.  After loading the sample, record the signal for _30s . In between, pick the second pipette and fill it with a positive control recoverin sample and the GST-NRK25 fusion protein. Press the control switch 11b, which will open the flow cell. The sample that was already inside will be sucked away immediately. Now load the new sample in the same way and record the signal.6.  Every sample should be measured five times in a single experiment (technical replicates), along with five measurements of the positive control sample and five measurements of the negative control sample. A minimum of three biological replicates should be measured.7.  As you are using the same flow cell for the measurement of both samples (here recoverin and control), it is important to clean the flow cells in between. The following order can be followed for your convenience.a.  Load reference sample and measure.b.  Clean the flow cell with the same buffer that was used to prepare the sample.c.  Load recoverin sample and measure.d.  Wash once with 10ul of 70% or 100% ethanol.e.  Wash five times with double-distilled water.f.  Equilibrate the channel two times with your sample buffer.g.  Start again with the reference sample (repeat from a to g).()# Figure 13.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-884","title":"Bacterial Infection with Listeria monocytogenes in Mice and Subsequent Analysis of Antigen-Specific CD8 T Cell Responses","text":"Bacterial Infection with Listeria monocytogenes in Mice and Subsequent Analysis of Antigen-Specific CD8 T Cell Responses\n\n# Abstract\n\nPathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa can cause acute and chronic infections in their hosts. The intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes serves as a model pathogen to assess the molecular mechanisms regulating CD8 T cell activation, differentiation, and function. We set up an experimental workflow to investigate cell-intrinsic roles of the nuclear receptor NR2F6 in CD8 T cell memory formation upon Listeria monocytogenes (LmOVA) infection (Jakic et al., 2021). The current protocol details how to cultivate ovalbumin-expressing LmOVA, infect naïve C57BL/6 mice with these bacteria and determine the bacterial load in host organs. Furthermore, we describe how to evaluate antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses and discriminate between short-lived effector and memory precursor cells in vivo following LmOVA infection (Figure 1). To assess CD8 T cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms, we integrated an adoptive cell transfer (ACT) experiment of genetically modified naïve OT-I CD8 T cells into congenic hosts before LmOVA infection.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin, strain DMC 09-082 (LmOVA), carries an erythromycin resistance plasmid (Foulds et al., 2002; Ahn et al., 2016). Notes:\n\na.  Pathogen safety caution: Listeria monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped coccobacillus, which causes a mild febrile illness. Disease manifestations include listeriosis in pregnancy, listeriosis of the central nervous system (CNS), febrile gastroenteritis,  glandular  listeriosis,  local  listeriosis,  typhoid  listeriosis,  and  atypical listeriosis. L. monocytogenes is commonly classified as a bio-safety class 2 organism. When working with L. monocytogenes, personal protection safety measures should be planned ahead and in accordance with official biosafety regulations. Please note that pregnant women are not advised to work with L. monocytogenes, as listeriosis can cause severe disease of the fetus or newborn baby.\nb.  All liquids should be discarded into bottles containing q0% sodium hypochlorite or an equivalent antimicrobial agent. Disposable plasticware carrying potentially infectious material should be collected and autoclaved before disposal.\nc.  Store bacteria in liquid nitrogen or at -80^°C. . For long-term storage, mix 500 μl bacteria in the exponential growth phase with 500 μl 20% glycerol in Lysogeny broth (LB) medium and shock freeze.\nd.  Recombinant Listeria monocytogenes strains expressing altered OVA protein termed altered peptide ligands (A P L) , such as A2, Y3, Q4, T4, and V4, are also available (Zehn et al., 2009).\n70% ethanol\n\n3.

All steps should be performed in a biosafety cabinet class II. Sterilize all surfaces of the cabinet with UV light and 70% ethanol before and after the procedures.b.  Wear personal protective equipment, including a lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.1.  Place a vial with frozen bacteria on ice in a biosafety level 2 cabinet. With a sterile 200 μl pipette tip or a disposable inoculation loop, take a smear of the frozen bacteria and spread it onto an LB plate with erythromycin (see scheme below for spreading movements). Change the tip or inoculation loop, drag it through the first streak, and spread it in the next 1/4 of the plate. Repeat this process with the secondary streak. With each new streak, drag a new tip or loop across the latest streak before starting the spread for efficiency. It is advisable to spread bacteria from 2-3 different vials onto separate LB plates to ensure colony growth. Place the plate up-side-down at 37^°C (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Experimental outline.Listeria growth and dilution, procedures A1 and A3-4. Adoptive transfer and infection of mice with LmOVA, procedures B, C, D-F. Created with BioRender.com.2.  After ^24h , single colonies of bacteria should be visible (if not, leave the bacteria for another 24 h). Pick one colony with a sterile 200~ul pipette tip, and stir it in 100ml of LB medium ^+ erythromycin at 37^°C in a sterile Erlenmeyer flask (the volume of the culture should not exceed 20% of the total volume). Cover the lid of the flask with aluminum or parafilm, and place it in a flask-shaker (225 rpm) at 37^°C overnight (Figure 2).3.  The following morning, transfer 100~ul of the overnight growth culture into a sterile Erlenmeyer flask with fresh pre-warmed 100~ml of LB medium ^+ erythromycin and place in a 37^°C flaskshaker (225 rpm). Save at least 10ml of the fresh LB-medium ^+ erythromycin to use as a blank when determining bacterial growth with a spectrophotometer. Determine corrected OD600 every ^2h by pipetting 1~ml of the fresh LB-medium ^+ erythromycin into a 1.6~ml semi-micro-cuvette and setting it as blank, followed by pipetting 1 ml of the bacterial growth in a new 1~m cuvette and measuring OD600. When corrected OD600 corresponds to an OD where bacteria are in exponential growth (for details, see below), growth can be stopped by placing the bacteria on ice, and bacteria can be prepared for injection into the mouse (Figure 2).a.  The O D_60O over a whole day should be determined in a pilot experiment to identify the O D_60O where bacteria are optimally growing in an exponential phase. This can differ depending on the spectrophotometer, LB-medium, temperature, etc. Exponential bacterial growth is at corrected OD600 0.5-1.0, and bacteria typically reach corrected O D_600=O.5 after 5h (Jones and D’Orazio, 2013; Ahn et al., 2016).b.  It is essential to use the same batch of LB-medium ^+ erythromycin for bacterial growth and blank.c. When taking out the flask with bacteria from the 37^°C shaker, work quickly and put bacteria back immediately if optimal corrected O D_600 has not been reached.4.  Once the optimal bacterial density is reached, the concentration of the bacteria can be calculated using the following formula: c = corrected O D_600×11×10^8/ml. Perform serial dilutions in sterile PBS using ^2m Eppendorf tubes, e.g., if the initial bacterial concentration is 6.6×10^8/ml , prepare serial dilutions by adding 757.6~ul (corresponding to 5~× 10^8 bacteria) of bacterial solution to 242.4~ul of PBS, followed by four serial dilutions using 100 ul into 900ul of PBS, to get the final concentration of 5×10^4 bacteria/ml (Figure 3). Note: Initial volume will depend on the concentration of bacteria and needs to be recalculated each time. Make sure to mix properly by pipetting up and down, and prepare excess material as backup material. For mouse tail vein injection, dilute bacteria to 5×10^4 bacteria/ml in order to inject 10^4 CFU per mouse in a total volume of 200 μl (Procedure C below).()# Figure 3. Bacterial serial dilutions.One specific example of serial dilutions of bacteria is shown. Created with BioRender.com.5.  After infecting the mice (see Procedure C), use the final dilution of the left-over bacteria to control for the concentration of bacteria in the injected material. Dilute the bacteria serially 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 in PBS and plate 100ul of each dilution in technical duplicates by spreading onto LB ^+ erythromycin plates. Grow up-side-down for ^24h at 37^°C (Figure 2).6.  After ^24h , count the colonies. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) should correspond to 5×10^4 bacteria/ml in the original mixture (Figure 2); for further details, see Table 2. Notes:a.  Plates with >300 colonies or <30 colonies should not be used to calculate cells numbers due to inaccuracy.b.  Mix the serial dilutions of the bacteria thoroughly before plating.7.  Glycerol stocks for long-term storage can be prepared by mixing 500~ul bacteria in the exponential growth phase with 500 u20% glycerol in Lysogeny broth (LB) from an overnight culture in a cryogenic vial and stored at -80^°C or in liquid nitrogen.B.  (Optional) Adoptive transfer of OT-I CD8 T cellsNotes:a.  This step is optional in case one wishes to study the dynamics of antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. The adoptive cell transfer should be done one day before or on the day of the infection.b.  Keep cells and reagents on ice unless otherwise indicated.1.  Sacrifice one OT-I transgenic (CD45.2) mouse using C O_2 , isoflurane, or ketamine-xylazine according to the applicable rule for work with experimental mice.2.  Collect lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes, from the mouse into cold PBS containing 2% FCS (FACS buffer, see Recipes) in 15ml tubes on ice. This donor mouse should be sex-and-age-matched to the congenic (CD45.1) recipient.3.  Bring the organs to a biosafety cabinet class I. Insert a 100~um cell strainer into a 50~ml tube and place on ice. Place the lymphoid organs onto the cell strainer and carefully mash in circular motions with the blunt end of a 5ml syringe. Gently rinse the strainer into the 50~ml tube with the FACS buffer using a 1 ml pipette. Repeat the procedure until no tissue clumps are left in the strainer.4.  Remove the cell strainer and screw the cap onto the 50ml tube. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293r c f) for 7 min at 4^°C . Open the tube in the biosafety cabinet and decant the supernatant.5.  Add 3ml of × erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) and mix by pipetting up and down. Incubate for 3 min at RT. Top up with 6ml of FACS buffer and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 7 min at 4^°C .6.  Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1~ml of Buffer C (see Recipes). The pellet should now have a whitish color.7.  Mix the cell suspension thoroughly by pipetting up and down with a 200~ul pipette. Add 4-9 ml of Buffer C. Count cells, e.g., using a Luna cell counter: In a U-bottom well of a 96-well plate mix 1.5~ul of Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide Stain +~13.5~ul of cell suspension. Load 10~ul on the slide to assess the fraction of live cells. Alternatively, any cell counter or a hemocytometer and trypan blue can be used.8.  Remove 1×10^6 cells and save in FACS buffer at 4^°C for flow cytometry analysis at a later time point (see below in Procedure E).9.  Isolate naïve CD8 T cells using the Naïve CD8a+ T Cell Isolation Kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. •  For every 1×10^7 cells, resuspend the pellet in 40~ul of Buffer +10 ul of biotin-antibody cocktail in a 15ml tube. Mix well and incubate for 10 min at 4^°C .•  For 1×10^7 cells, add 20 of ul Buffer +20lmul of anti-biotin microbeads +10ul of anti-CD44 microbeads. Mix well and incubate for another 15m i n at 4^°C .• Add 10ml of Buffer C and centrifuge at 287× g for 7 min at 4^°C .• Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3ml of Buffer C.• Place a pre-cooled (4^°C) LS column in the magnetic field of the Miltenyi MidiMACS separator.• Rinse the column with 3ml of ice-cold buffer C. Discard the flow-through.• Place a 15ml tube on ice and position it below the outlet of the column. Load the 3ml of cell suspension onto the column and collect the flow-through in a 15~ml tube. Rinse each column once with 3ml of Buffer C. The total volume of the collected flow-through is 6ml .10. Count cells (see Step B7).11. Remove 1×10^6 cells and save in FACS buffer at 4^°C for flow cytometry analysis at a later timepoint (see below in Procedure E).12. Centrifuge at 287× g for 7 min at 4~^°C . Dilute cells in sterile PBS to reach the number of cells that need to be transferred per mouse. For experiments with 24~h engraftment prior to Lm infection and day 1 post-infection read-out, inject 3×10^6 cells per mouse in 100~ul of PBS (room-temperature, RT); for d3 post-infection read-out, inject 1×10^6 cells per mouse in 100ul of PBS (RT); and for d7 or later post-infection read-out, inject 2×10^4 cells per mouse in 100ul of PBS (RT). Resuspend cells prior to injection into the tail vein. Note: Engraftment can be assessed _24h after adoptive cell transfer (when LmOVA is injected) by collecting 50 μl of peripheral blood according to the guidelines of the relevant animal experiment ethical permit and proceeding with flow cytometry analysis as described below (see below in Procedure E).C.  Injection of LmOVA and monitoring of animals1.  Perform the infection of mice in a bio-safety level 2 (BSL-2) animal facility. Animals need to be housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC). Note: After infection, all used cages, including litter, need to be autoclaved. Measure individual mouse baseline body weight using a lockable box and a precision scale that can be disinfected. Note: Ideally, mice should get used to the daily weighting process 3-5 days prior to the experiment in order to avoid weight loss due to stress responses. It is also advisable to weigh the mice at the same time each day in order to avoid fluctuations due to food intake.2.  Put an individual mouse into the restrainer. Note: To better visualize the vein and facilitate injection, the animals can be placed below an infrared lamp for 5-10 min, being careful not to overheat the animals. A video demonstrating this procedure can be found at the following link: Intravenous Injection in the Mouse: https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intravenous-injection-in-the-mouse/.3.  Intravenously inject well mixed LmOVA, as prepared in Procedure A, into mice via the tail vein using a 29G insulin syringe. Inject 200~ul of a 5×10^4 bacteria/ml dilution per mouse for a total of 10^4 bacteria (Figure 2). Discard the needle and syringe in a biohazard sharps container for later autoclaving.Note: Infection can be done either in healthy wild-type mice or in mice that had received OT-I cells the day before by adoptive cell transfer.4.  To determine the actual CFU that was injected, follow procedure A5 (see above).5.  Monitor the weight and general wellbeing of the animals every day for the first 7 days after bacterial infection. An initial weight drop is expected on days 1-3; later on, a recovery in weight can be observed. Monitor the consistency of the feces, which should be softer and lighter in color compared to normal conditions.Note: Check the general appearance of the mice carefully, corresponding to your experimental animal license. Severe pain, suffering, and distress must be prevented.# D.  Preparing spleen homogenates for plating# Notes:a.  Lm can be detected in the spleen for up to 7 days after infection in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. In animals that had received OT-I cells, the bacteria are cleared faster and are rarely detected on day 7 (unpublished observation). The bacterial load can be assessed during the acute phase (24 h and 3 days after infection) and/or during peak immune response (7 days after infection).b.  A fraction of the spleen can be used to evaluate immune cells via flow cytometry. In this case, after recording the spleen weight, the preparation of single-cell suspensions should be generated following steps 1-8 in procedure B, and subsequently, only 50% of the cell suspension will be lysed in 0.14%Tergitol/PBS for plating onto LB Agar plates. The other 50% can be used for flow cytometric analysis as described in procedure E.c.  All work should be performed in a biosafety cabinet class II and with adequate protective gear.1.  Sacrifice animals as described in Procedure B1 and collect spleens in 15~ml conical tubes containing 5ml of cold FACS buffer; store the tubes on ice.2.  Bring the spleen to a biosafety cabinet class II. Record the weight of the spleen. If CD8 T cell responses are to be analyzed in parallel by flow cytometry, proceed with the weighing of 50% of the spleen.3.  Mash the spleen (or 50% of the organ) in a sterile 100 mm×15 mm Petri dish in 5~ml of 0.14% Tergitol/PBS. Tergitol causes immediate cell lysis and releases intracellular bacteria.4.  Prepare serial 10-fold dilutions of the cell lysate in PBS ranging from 1:10 to 1:1,000,000 and plate 100~ul of each dilution in technical duplicates by spreading onto LB ^+ erythromycin LB Agar plates. Grow upside-down at 37^°C for 24~h (Figure 2).5.  After 24-48h , count the colonies. Plates with CFU between 30-300 should be used to determine the bacterial load (Figure 2). An example calculation is provided in Table 2:# Table 2. Example calculation of CFUs()CFU = colony forming units, Ga CFU = Grand CFU, = Volume, mg = milligram, hom. = homogenate.Average CFU is multiplied by 10 to get concentration per ml ( 100 uI× 10=1 mI) .E.  Preparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for flow cytometry analysis Notes:a.  The same animal can be analyzed at various time points after LmOVA infection, such as early (d3), peak (d7), memory (d70), or after re-infection.b.  PBMCs can also be collected one day after ACT to assess the engraftment of OT-I cells.1.  Collect 50~ul of peripheral blood (approx. 2-3 drops) from either the mandibular or tail vein into an Eppendorf tube with 10~ul of heparin.2.  Transfer the tube into a biosafety cabinet class II.3.  Transfer 50ul of the blood/heparin mixture into 10ml of homemade erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) in a 50ml tube and incubate for 5 min at RT. Then add ^20ml of FACS buffer.4.  Centrifuge at 287× g for 7 min at 4^°C and decant the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 1ml of FACS buffer and count the cells as described above (Procedure B7).5.  Transfer 0.5×10^6-1×10^6 cells per FACS tube and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 rcf) for 7 min at 4^°C and decant the supernatant.6.  Add 10ul of Fc-Block (1:25 in FACS buffer), resuspend, and incubate for 5 min at RT or 4^°C .7.  Add 50~ul of the antibody mixture (diluted as described below) and stain for 30 min at 4^°C , protecting from light. Note: Staining with SIINFEKL-tetramer should be performed at RT.8.  Add 1~ml of FACS buffer, centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 r c f) for 7 min at 4^°C and decant the supernatant.9.  Fix the cells with 1% PFA/PBS for 20 min at RT.10.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-901","title":"CD45 Immunohistochemistry in Mouse Kidney","text":"CD45 Immunohistochemistry in Mouse Kidney\n\n# Abstract\n\nCD45 is a pan-leukocyte marker, and CD45 stain is widely used to determine the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and its association with tissue injury. In this manuscript, we share a reliable immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol for CD45 staining in sections of paraffin-embedded mouse kidney. A rat anti-CD45 antibody was used as primary antibody, and a mouse adsorbed biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was selected as secondary antibody. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked avidin/biotin detection system was used to amplify the signal, which was detected with ^3,3^ -Diaminobenzidine (DAB). With this protocol, we show that the CD45 antibody recognizes cells of hematolymphoid lineage in bone marrow, as well as monocyte/macrophages in liver and lung tissue. The utility of this protocol in pathology research was indicated by dramatically increased CD45-positive (C D45^+) ) cells in the kidneys of a mouse model of diabetes. Double staining for CD45 and injury marker KIM-1 showed accumulated C D45^+ cells around injured tubular cells. CD45 and F4/80 macrophage staining on adjacent tissue sections revealed overlap of C D45^+ cells with other inflammatory cells.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Tissue slidesThe slides used were obtained from mouse tissue, specifically bone marrow, lung, liver, and kidney. All tissues were processed by standard formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and tissue block sectioning, except for bone marrow of mouse tibia, which was decalcified between formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. For this purpose, the tibia bone was isolated from normal adult C57/Bl6 mice, fixed with formalin for 48h , decalcified in 14% EDTA solution for 72h before embedding with paraffin. Kidneys were harvested from the diabetic OVE26 mice a transgenic mouse strain with early and persistent hyperglycemia (Epstein et al., 1989), and identified as a reliable mouse model of diabetic nephropathy (Zheng et al., 2004) and uninephrectomized OVE26 mice (Zheng et al., 2011). Non-diabetic control kidney was obtained from age matched, same strain FVB mice. These animals have been tested for albuminuria, and their kidneys have been histologically evaluated with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and Masson’s trichrome stain. The kidneys with obvious tubulointerstitial fibrosis were used for demonstration of CD45 staining. The tissue sections of kidney, liver, and lung were cut at 4um , and sections of tibia were cut at 5:um . Sections were mounted on positively charged slides. Prior to staining, all paraffin sections were heated for 30m i n at 70^°C . Bone marrow tissue was considered a positive control, and sections with omitted CD45 primary antibody were used as negative control.# B.  CD45 staining# Immunohistochemistry (IHC)1.

Sperm cells are transported by the muscular activity of the myometrium to the uterotubal junction (UTJ) before entering the oviduct where they undergo this physiological process, termed capacitation. Since the successful emulation of mammalian sperm capacitation in vitro, which led to the development of in vitro fertilization techniques, sperm capacitation and gamete interaction studies have been mostly carried out under in vitro conditions. Sperm cells are typically incubated in vitro for up to several hours at a concentration of more than 1 million cells per milliliter in the capacitation media inside a 37^°C incubator with 5% C O_2 , mimicking the tubal fluid composed of serum albumin, bicarbonate, and Ca^2+ . The resultant sperm are functionally and molecularly heterogeneous with respect to acrosome reaction, motility, and phosphorylation. By contrast, in vivo sperm capacitation occurs in a time- and space-dependent manner, with limits on the number of capacitating sperm in the oviduct. The small number of sperm at the fertilization site in vivo are highly homogeneous and uniformly capable of fertilization. This discrepancy makes the degree of correlation between the changes observed from in vitro capacitation as a population average and the fertilizing capacity of sperm less clear. To overcome this issue, we used CLARITY tissue clearing to visualize sperm directly inside the female tract in situ and isolated sperm capacitated in vivo from the oviducts of the female mice after timed mating (Ded et al., 2020). Here, we present a step-by-step protocol to collect in vivo capacitated sperm by detailing a microdissection technique and subsequent preparation steps for fluorescent imaging. The advantage of the microdissection technique over in vitro capacitation is the ability to collect physiologically segregated, homogeneous sperm populations at different stages of capacitation. Compared to CLARITY, this technique is more straightforward and compatible with a broader spectrum of antibodies for downstream imaging studies, as it allows the researcher to avoid a potentially high background from non-sperm cells in the tissue. The disadvantage of this technique is the potential contamination of the isolated sperm from different regions of the oviduct and disruption of the fine molecular structures (e.g., CatSper nanodomains) during sperm isolation, especially when the preparation is not performed swiftly. Hence, we suggest that the combination of both in situ and ex vivo isolated sperm imaging is the best way how to address the molecular features of in vivo capacitated sperm.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Stereo microscope (Nikon, model: SMZ1270)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  Timed mating of female mice in the estrous stage1.  For timed mating, hyper-stimulated (super-ovulated) or non-stimulated female mice can be used. The hyper-stimulation procedure increases the chance of successful timed mating. a.  Hyper-stimulation: Hyper stimulate female mouse (22-24 days old optimally but up to 35 days old) with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) 5-IU injection of PMSG, followed by a 5-IU i.p. injection of hCG 48h after PMSG. Calculate the time of both injections to start timed mating 12-14h after the hCG injection. The protocol can be modified according to the animal stock provider’s suggestions (e.g., The Jackson Laboratory; https://www.jax.org/). Alternatively, the estrous cycle can be determined by examining washes of cell smears of the vagina to increase the success rate of the timed mating. b.  Determining the stage of the estrous cycle in female mice is described in detail in Champlin et al. (1973) and Caligioni (2009).2.  Introduce a male to a female mouse housed in the single cage during the last dark hour of the 12 h long dark cycle (30 min to 1 h). Work under red light when handling mice for mating to not disrupt the light/dark cycle.3.  Check the presence of vaginal plugs as soon as the light cycle begins (set this time as 1 h postcoitus). Females with plugs can be used for the experiment at a desired time point (i.e., 3 h or 7 h post-coitus). Save females without plugs as they can be used for another run of timed mating.4.  Hormone injection and mating time should be customized according to the availability of the animal room with flexible light/dark cycle adjustment and the experimenter’s schedule. The following example is based on the lack of such facility and flexible schedule of an experimenter: In a facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle with the light on at 7 am and off at 7 pm, PMSG can be injected on Day 1 at 6 pm, followed by 6 pm hCG injection on Day 3. At 6 am (12 h after hCG) on Day 4, start timed mating under red light without disrupting the light/dark cycle by introducing a male to females. When the light is on at 7 am, the females are allowed to mate for ^2h . In the next 30 min or so, check the plug and sacrifice the plugged females at 9:30-10:30 am for collecting in vivo capacitated sperm from 3-4 h post-coitus or 4:30-5:30 pm for collection in vivo capacitated sperm at 7-8h post-coitus.B.  Microdissection and isolation of in vivo capacitated sperm1.  After the sperm remain inside the female reproductive tract for a sufficient duration to allow in vivo capacitation, sacrifice the female mice with the confirmed vaginal plugs either by C O_2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation.2.  Under the well-lit stereo microscope, grip the fat pad around the ovary and stretch gently to clearly identify the membranous boundary between the ovary and the oviduct (line 1) and the oviduct and the uterus (line 2) (Figure 1).3.  Carefully cut through the membrane around the proximal oviduct to slightly de-coil the oviduct first (line 2), followed by the membrane around the bursa and just outside infundibulum (line 1), and lastly, cut through the uterus just outside UTJ (line 3) (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Scheme of mouse female reproductive tract dissection. Drawing slightly modified from Nagy (2003) in Manipulating the Mouse Embryo.4.  The trimmed female tract (right) and the number and distribution of in vivo capacitated sperm (left) will look like Figure 2A.5.  (Optional) If Acr-EGFP or Su9-DsRed/Acr-EGF mice are used, the distribution and number of sperm can be validated under the fluorescent microscope (Figure 2B).()Figure 2.

(A-B) Number of sperm recovered from each region of the female tract, aligned with an actual example image of a dissected female tract as described. Scale bar, 50~um . (C) Validating location and number of Acr-EGF sperm in the isthmus with fluorescence microscopy.6.  Place individual trimmed tract into a 0.3ml -droplet of M2 media under mineral oil (Figure 3A) and further dissect them carefully with a microsurgical scalpel into ampullar, middle isthmus (2- 3m m ), and UTJ parts (Figure 3B).7.  Immediately place each part into an individual a 100-μl droplet of M2 media in a mini-Petri dish under mineral oil and gently press to release sperm (Figure 3B).()Figure 3. Microdissection and aspiration of sperm from different regions of the female reproductive tract. (A) Oviduct dissected by microsurgical scalpel placed into a 0.3-ml M2 droplet. (B) Placing individual oviductal parts into a 0.1-ml M2 droplet. (C) Observation under stereo microscope and picking sperm by glass microcapillary. (D) A setup of mouth aspiration pipette with a glass capillary tube and a filter. (E) A schematic cartoon representation of visible components of the droplet under the microscope before and after additional transfer/washing.8.  Observe the droplets (optimally by three persons) under (stereo) microscopes (e.g., for 10 min) and pick individual sperm with an aspirator connected to a filter in the middle and 50-ul glass microcapillary by mouth pipetting (Figure 3C and 3D).9.  Depending on the speed of dissection and handling of the tissue, there will be other cell types, such as discharged epithelial cells and red blood cells (RBC), and debris together with sperm cells (Figure 3E). As sperm cells are smaller than these somatic cells (except fine debris), transferring the liquid to the 2^n d droplet by avoiding these contaminants can help to obtain a preparation more enriched with sperm cells.# C.  Slide preparation1.  Coat the surface of the slides with fibronectin. (A) Method A uses the fibronectin solution from bovine plasma: take 50-100~ul directly from the vial and spot onto the surface multiples times, making a domed solution with the desirable size. After 2-5 min when the edge of the dome is about to dry, rinse the coating solution with water. The slide/coverslip is ready to use for the next step. Method A does not require additional incubation time. (B) Method B prepares fresh fibronectin solution from fibronectin powder from human plasma. Reconstitute in sterile water by incubating for 30 min at 37^°C to yield 1 m/m stock solution. Make small aliquots and keep frozen at -20^°C until use. Prepare a fresh working solution ( 50 u/m l in water) from an aliquot and apply 50ul per well (3-well slide) or 10ul per well (8-well slide). Incubate the slide/coverslip in a humid chamber for 1 h . Rinse the coating solution with water and keep the slides in the chamber prior to sperm deposition. The time between the coating and sperm deposition should be as short as possible. Ideally, the whole procedure should be tested to optimize the cell attachment and reduce the background for the subsequent immunofluorescent microscopy due to the lot-to-lot variation of fibronectin.2.  Place the picked-up sperm to 10~ul PBS droplet on the fibronectin-coated 8-well Teflon slides (Figure 4A: At a minimum, an average of 10 sperm per sample should be obtained). If too much tissue material is transferred by micropipette, a PBS washing step can be added (Figure 3E).()Figure 4. Slide preparation for downstream experiments and example images. (A) Sperm transfer by glass micropipette into 8-well Teflon microdroplet slides. (B) An example of setting up a 3-well Teflon smeared slide.3.  Subject the rest of the material to finer dissection, remove macroscopic pieces manually, mix the rest of the material with PBS (material/PBS 1:10), and smear it on the fibronectin-coated 3- well Teflon slides (Figure 4B: 30-50~uI per well).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Timed Mating of Female Mice\n## Hyper-stimulation of Female Mice\nHyper-stimulate female mouse (22-24 days old optimally but up to 35 days old) with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) 5-IU injection of PMSG.\nFollowed by a 5-IU i.p. injection of hCG 48h after PMSG.\nCalculate the time of both injections to start timed mating 12-14h after the hCG injection.\n## Determining the Stage of the Estrous Cycle\nDetermine the stage of the estrous cycle in female mice by examining washes of cell smears of the vagina.\nRefer to Champlin et al.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1000","title":"A Novel Method to Make Polyacrylamide Gels with Mechanical Properties Resembling those of Biological Tissues","text":"A Novel Method to Make Polyacrylamide Gels with Mechanical Properties Resembling those of Biological Tissues\n\n# Abstract\n\nStudies characterizing how cells respond to the mechanical properties of their environment have been enabled by the use of soft elastomers and hydrogels as substrates for cell culture. A limitation of most such substrates is that, although their elastic properties can be accurately controlled, their viscous properties cannot, and cells respond to both elasticity and viscosity in the extracellular material to which they bind. Some approaches to endow soft substrates with viscosity as well as elasticity are based on coupling static and dynamic crosslinks in series within polymer networks or forming gels with a combination of sparse chemical crosslinks and steric entanglements. These materials form viscoelastic fluids that have revealed significant effects of viscous dissipation on cell function; however, they do not completely capture the mechanical features of soft solid tissues. In this report, we describe a method to make viscoelastic solids that more closely mimic some soft tissues using a combination of crosslinked networks and entrapped linear polymers. Both the elastic and viscous moduli of these substrates can be altered separately, and methods to attach cells to either the elastic or the viscous part of the network are described.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  18-mm  diameter  glass  coverslips  (Menzel-Glaser,  VWR,  catalog  number: MENZCB00190RA020)\n2.  6-well plates (Corning, Fischer Scientific, catalog number: 07-200-83)\n3.

Glass coverslip functionalization.  Adhesive coverslips a.  Pour 100 ml 0.1 M NaOH into a 250 m glass beaker and preclean each coverslip by immersing in NaOH; allow them to air-dry. b.  Under the chemical hood, pour 100 ml 3-APTMS solution into a 250-ml glass beaker and immerse the coverslips for 3m i n . c.  Wash the coverslips 3-5 times with 100 ml MilliQ water until no foam is observed in the water. CRITICAL STEP: Residual 3-APTMS will react with glutaraldehyde in the next step and produce an orange precipitate. If this happens, discard the coverslips and start from step a). d.  Prepare 200 ml 0.5% glutaraldehyde in MilliQ water in a 250 m glass beaker. Place the coverslips in a mini-rack and immerse in glutaraldehyde solution for 1h . e.  Air-dry the coverslips and store under vacuum at room temperature.2.  Non-adhesive coverslips a.  Under a chemical hood, prepare 100m l5% SurfaSil Siliconized Fluid in acetone. b.  Immerse the coverslips in SurfaSil solution for 0s and agitate to ensure a uniform coat. c.  Rinse the coverslips with clean acetone. d.  Rinse the coverslips with methanol. e.  Air-dry the coverslips and store at room temperature.B.  Preparation of the linear polyacrylamide solution1.  Prepare a 10% (w/v) solution of APS in H_2O before use. For long-term storage, aliquot the solution into 500-mul Eppendorf tubes and store in a -20^°C freezer. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Solutions stored at room temperature are not stable. For the most effective polymerization, we recommend preparing a fresh 10% (w/v) solution of APS immediately prior to each gelpreparation.2.  In a 50mI glass bottle, mix acrylamide, H_2O , TEMED, and 10% APS according to the recipe in Table 1.CAUTION: The linear polyacrylamide solution can be made as inert or activated with the capability of binding adhesive proteins. If you aim to prepare activated linear polyacrylamide, substitute 1 ml H_2O with 1 ml 4% NHS-acrylate in DMSO, according to Table 1.CRITICAL STEP: It is important to use very low amounts of polymerization initiator (APS) to ensure the formation of very long linear polyacrylamide chains with radii of gyration much larger than the mesh size of the crosslinked network of polyacrylamide. This prevents the linear chains from diffusing out of the polyacrylamide network during the time of the experiment.Table 1. Composition of linear polyacrylamide solution in ml for a total volume of 10ml()3.  Polymerize for 1 h at 37^°C .4.  Cover the bottle with aluminum foil to protect it from light. Store at 4^°C . If linear polyacrylamide is properly polymerized, it can be stored for months.CAUTION: The linear polyacrylamide solution is highly viscous; therefore, it is difficult to pipette it accurately. We suggest cutting the pipette tip before transferring and transferring the solution slowly.# C.  Preparation of viscoelastic polyacrylamide gels1.  In an Eppendorf tube, mix acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, linear polyacrylamide, H_2O , and 4% NHSacrylate in DMSO (if applicable) according to the recipe presented in Table 2.CRITICAL STEP: Mix the solution very gently by pipetting it up and down. It is important not to introduce air bubbles into the mixture. If you fail, you might need to degas the solution in a vacuum desiccator. The presence of air bubbles in the mixture will disrupt polymerization and change the mechanical properties of the resulting gels.Table 2. Composition of viscoelastic polyacrylamide gels in ul for a total volume of 500~ul()2.  Add TEMED and 10% APS according to Table 2, gently mix and pipet 100~ul gel mix onto the adhesive coverslip, and place the non-adhesive coverslip on top of the droplet.3.  After 15m i n , add MilliQ water around the gel to avoid drying on the sides.4.  After an additional 15m i n , remove the non-adhesive coverslip from the top of the gel, place the gel in a 6-well plate, and immerse in water.CAUTION: The mechanical properties of the gels depend strongly on the quality of the reagents used for the gel formulation, accuracy in pipetting, and mixing of the mixture. Most of the failures in gel polymerization come from mistakes in APS and TEMED pipetting and mixing or inappropriate storage of these solutions. Briefly, TEMED should be kept in the dark, and APS, which is not stable in water, should be freshly prepared for the most effective polymerization. We strongly recommend directly measuring the viscoelasticity of the gels using a rheometer after every separate preparation. In our experience, mixing and pipetting is not always identical, and G’ tends to decrease as reagents get old, apparently due to oxidation. Thus, discrepancies in the measured G’ and G’’ values can be as large as 50% .# D.  Attachment of the adhesion proteinsViscoelastic polyacrylamide gels consist of an acrylamide and bis-acrylamide network polymerized in the presence of linear polyacrylamide chains that are incorporated into the network, which determine its viscous properties. Our method allows for the covalent binding of proteins to the polyacrylamide network, linear polyacrylamide, or both.1.  Attachment of adhesion proteins to only the linear polyacrylamide a.  To prepare activated linear polyacrylamide that can be crosslinked to the protein of interest, follow section ^B . Preparation of the linear polyacrylamide solution” and the recipe from Table 1 for activated linear polyacrylamide. The resulting linear polyacrylamide chains will covalently bind proteins upon incubation with the protein of interest diluted to 0.1m g/m l protein in 50~m M HEPES p H 8.2 for ^2h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C (both incubations result in uniform coating). For protein incubation, prepare a minimum of 80~ul 0.1m g/m l protein solution per 18–m m diameter gel. The larger the gel, the more protein solution is needed.CAUTION: Incubation with the proteins is performed following polymerization of viscoelastic gels using activated linear polyacrylamide chains immediately after their incorporation within the acrylamide/bis-acrylamide network. Linear polyacrylamide chains of the viscoelastic gel cannot be selectively activated after polymerization of the crosslinked network.b.  After incubation with the protein, rinse the gels 3 times with 100ul PBS and store in PBS at 4^°C until cell seeding, but not longer than a couple of days.2.  Attachment of the proteins to only the crosslinked polyacrylamide network . 4% NHS in DMSO method i.  Prepare fresh 4% NHS solution in DMSO. ii.  Add 50u14% NHS in DMSO per 500ul gel mix volume according to Table 2. CAUTION: 4% NHS solution in DMSO is added to the gel mix prior to polymerization. The crosslinked polyacrylamide network of the viscoelastic gel cannot be selectively activated post-polymerization. iii.  When APS and TEMED are mixed in, cast the gels between adhesive and non-adhesive coverslips,  as  previously  described  (Section  C:  Preparation  of  viscoelastic polyacrylamide gels). iv.  Once the gel is rinsed and soaked in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.2, illuminate with UV light under the hood for 15m i n . From this step forward, gels that will be used for cell seeding should be maintained under aseptic conditions. v.  Immerse the gels in the protein of interest diluted to 0.1 mg/ml protein in 50m M HEPES p H8.2 and incubate for ^2h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C (both incubations result in uniform coating). vi.  Rinse 3 times with PBS and store at 4^°C until cell seeding, but not longer than a couple of days. NHS-acrylate in toluene method i.  Under the chemical hood, prepare 0.5:m l:2% NHS-acrylate in toluene solution. ii.  Prepare the gel mix without APS and TEMED following the recipe from Table 2, with one modification, i.e., replace 50u14% NHS in DMSO with 50ul MilliQ water. iii.  Add 100 ul 2% NHS-acrylate in toluene solution per 500ul gel mix and agitate until the solution becomes uniformly turbid. iv.  Leave for 5 min at room temperature and then centrifuge at 10,000×g for 5 min to separate the toluene from the gel mix. v.  Remove the toluene (upper) layer using a 200-ul pipette and transfer the gel mix to a new tube. vi.  Add APS and TEMED to initiate polymerization and cast the gels between adhesive and non-adhesive coverslips, as previously described (Section C: Preparation of viscoelastic polyacrylamide gels). vii. Once the gel is rinsed and soaked in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.2, illuminate with UV light under the hood for 15 min. From this step forward, gels that will be used for cell seedingshould be maintained under aseptic conditions.viii. Immerse the gels in the protein of interest diluted to 0.1m g/m l protein in 50m M HEPES p H8.2 and incubate for ^2h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C (both incubations result in uniform coating). For protein incubation, prepare a minimum of 80ul0.1m g/m l protein solution per 18–m m diameter gel. The larger the gel, the more protein solution is needed.ix.  Rinse with 100 µl PBS 3 times and store in PBS at 4^°C until cell seeding, but not longer than a couple of days.3.  Attachment of proteins to both the linear polyacrylamide and crosslinked polyacrylamide networksa.  Soak the gels in 50m M HEPES pH 8.2 for 15m i n .b.  Prepare 5mM sulfo-SANPAH in 25% DMSO and 75% 50m M HEPES pH 8.2 (first dissolve sulfo-SANPAH in DMSO, then add HEPES in MilliQ water). A minimum of 80ul5m M sulfoSANPAH solution per 18–m m diameter gel is needed. CAUTION: We strongly recommend preparing fresh sulfo-SANPAH solution prior to each gel preparation and not storing it longer than 1 day.c.  Cover the surface of each gel with 80ul sulfo-SANPAH solution (for an 18–m m diameter gel) and illuminate with UV light (320-365~n m ) for 10-15 min under the hood. From this step forward, gels that will be used for cell seeding should be maintained under aseptic conditions. Properly activated sulfo-SANPAH should change color from bright orange to a darker burnt orange or brown. CAUTION: Do not overexpose the gels to UV light and do not allow the gels to dry during irradiation.d.  Rinse the gels 3-5 times with 100 ul 50 mM HEPES pH 8.2 until all the sulfo-SANPAH has been removed.e.  Immerse the gels in the protein of interest diluted to 0.1m g/m l protein in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.2 and incubate for ^2h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C (both incubations result in uniform coating). For protein incubation, prepare a minimum of 80ul0.1m g/m l solution per 18-mm diameter gel. The larger the gel, the more protein solution is needed.f.  Rinse 3 times with 100ul PBS and store in PBS at 4^°C until cell seeding. CAUTION: We recommend using the gels within a couple of days of preparation and not placing  them  in  long-term  storage.  On  long  time  scales  (day  to  weeks),  linear polyacrylamide chains can diffuse out of the gel surface and alter their mechanical properties.# E.  Cell seeding1.  Thirty minutes before seeding the cells, soak the gels in media and keep at 37^°C . 2.  Trypsinize the cells and prepare a cell suspension at the concentration of interest (to study cellsubstrate interactions, single cells are typically needed).3.  Remove the media used for soaking the gels and replace with the cell suspension. Keep the gels in the incubator at 37^°C . Cells will start to spread upon contact with the gel surface.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Glass Coverslip Functionalization\n## Adhesive Coverslips\nPour 100 ml 0.1 M NaOH into a 250 ml glass beaker and preclean each coverslip by immersing in NaOH; allow them to air-dry.\nUnder the chemical hood, pour 100 ml 3-APTMS solution into a 250-ml glass beaker and immerse the coverslips for 3 minutes.\nWash the coverslips 3-5 times with 100 ml MilliQ water until no foam is observed in the water.\nPrepare 200 ml 0.5% glutaraldehyde in MilliQ water in a 250 ml glass beaker.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1002","title":"Synchronized Real-time Measurement of Sec-mediated Protein Translocation","text":"Synchronized Real-time Measurement of Sec-mediated Protein Translocation\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Sec translocon, consisting of a heterotrimeric transmembrane channel (SecYEG) and an associated ATPase (SecA), catalyzes the export of unfolded proteins from the cytosol in bacteria. Kinetically resolving protein translocation at high resolution yields mechanistic insight into the process. Translocation is typically followed by measuring the protection of proteins transported into lipid vesicles, which only allows visualization of translocation after it has already been completed and limits time resolution. Here, we describe the implementation of an assay for measuring translocation in real-time. By priming the reconstituted translocon with suitably engineered substrate proteins, the kinetics of the actual translocation process can be resolved at high resolution. To analyze translocation kinetics, we developed a detailed kinetic model of the process that includes on-pathway and off-pathway processes.

Incubation of pOAmDHFR-p86 with copper/phenanthroline (C u^2+/P h) catalyzes the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. Oxidized pOAmDHFR-p86 migrates with higher electrophoretic mobility than the reduced form, as is expected for a protein containing a disulfide loop (lane 3 vs. lane 4). Lane 1:  -  -ME, - -cu^2+, Phenanthroline. Lane 2: + -ME, - C u^2+/ Phenanthroline. Lane 3: -  -ME, +Cu^2+. /Phenanthroline. Lane 4: - - -ME, +Cu^2+. /Phenanthroline.3.

Table 2 indicates the concentration and volume for each component in the real-time translocation reaction.Table 2. Components for the real-time translocation assay()2.  To set up more than one reaction in parallel, prepare a mastermix with the base components as shown above. For example, if running both an –ATP and +A T P sample, prepare _2.2× the reaction shown. Split the reaction by adding 100~ul mastermix to each well before the addition of ATP.3.  Begin setting up the reaction by incubating 10 nM SecYEG proteoliposomes with encapsulated 11S with GST-dark for 10 min at room temperature.4.  Prepare the Nano-Glo® Live Cell Assay System substrate according to the manufacturer’s protocol by diluting 1:20 in the buffer provided in the Nano- G l o^oplus Live Cell Assay System kit.5.  Add Buffer Q, 1 nM oxidized pOA-mDHFR-p86, Nano- G l o^oplus Live Cell Assay System Buffer with Nano- G l o^oplus substrate, and water to the proteoliposome/GST-dark reaction. Flick the tube gently to mix. Transfer 100ul reaction mix to a well of a 96-well plate.6.  Add 5 mM ATP to start insertion and stalling. For the –ATP control, add an equal volume of H_2O .7.  Place the plate in the GloMax Navigator and start the luminescence measurement (0.25-2 s integration time).9.  After the luminsence signal plateaus (30m i n) ), add 1 μl 1 M DTT to reduce the disulfide bond and begin translocation.10. Continue to collect luminesence data for 30 min (Figure 12).()Figure 12. Synchronized real-time translocation measurement. The upper graph shows the luminescence recording for a translocation experiment with oxidized pOA-mDHFR-p86 after mixing ATP, GST-dark, and SecYEG/SecA proteoliposomes containing encapsulated 11S. Closed orange circles are the data used to calculate a fit (black line) based on our detailed model (see Data analysis). Open orange circles are data points that were eliminated from the analysis due to an unusually high variance. The initial increase in luminescence results from side reactions that occur while stalled translocation substrate accumulates. Arrowheads indicate the addition of extra GST-dark and DTT to the reaction, as described in the Procedure (Section D). Additional GST-dark quenches any 11S protein that is accessible on the outside of the proteoliposomes. DTT reduces the substrate protein, restarting translocation and resulting in an increase in luminescence. The graph on the bottom shows the residuals from the fit.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Protein Purification\n## Purification of SecA\nTransform BL21 (DE3) cells with the plasmid containing SecAΔcys and plate on

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1008","title":"Clearing of the Mouse Brain for Optical Imaging Using CUBIC","text":"Clearing of the Mouse Brain for Optical Imaging Using CUBIC\n\n# Abstract\n\nHere, we describe a simple and efficient tissue clearing method, CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis), which was first introduced in 2014 (Susaki et al., 2014). In the present study, the hemispheres of wild-type adult mice were cleared by standard procedures and were browning free with good transparency and no significant changes in tissue shape or volume over a short time frame. Further, in combination with immunofluorescence staining, 3D highresolution images of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantina striatum region were obtained by rotating-disc confocal microscopy, in addition to images of mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons. Considering the limitations of existing brain tissue removal methods, such as CLARITY, 3DISCO, and SeeDB, CUBIC boasts simple operation, high fluorescent protein preservation, and good antibody penetration. Moreover, CUBIC variants and optimizations are available for the 3D imaging of rodent, large primate, and human tissues to meet researchers' specific requirements, which could make it a popular option among research labs. Our study demonstrates the use of the CUBIC protocol for understanding brain structure and function in model animals with neurological diseases.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Note: Once the mouse shows no toe-pinch response, the mouse is properly anesthetized.2.  Use pins to fix the stretched out mouse limbs to a foam board.3.  Expose the heart by an incision on the xiphoid process through the chest, skin, and bones using scissors.4.  Cut off the mouse's right auricle and perfuse the left ventricle with ^20ml precooled 1× PBS (pH 7.4) at 10ml/min . Subsequently, perfuse with 20m14% PFA. Note: Wait until the mouse is observed to have a white liver and clear, transparent fluid from the right auricle.5.  Cut off the mouse’s head, cut away the skin, and carefully break the skull between the eyes using scissors and tweezers so as not to damage the sample. Remove pieces of the skull using small, curved forceps. Take out the brain and other desired organs.6.  Immerse the brain tissue in 10m14% PFA. Post-fix overnight with shaking 30 rpm at 4^°C .

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1042","title":"Modeling the Nonlinear Dynamics of Intracellular Signaling Networks","text":"Modeling the Nonlinear Dynamics of Intracellular Signaling Networks\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis protocol illustrates a pipeline for modeling the nonlinear behavior of intracellular signaling pathways. At fixed spatial points, nonlinear signaling dynamics are described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). At constant parameters, these ODEs may have multiple attractors, such as multiple steady states or limit cycles. Standard optimization procedures fine-tune the parameters for the system trajectories localized within the basin of attraction of only one attractor, usually a stable steady state. The suggested protocol samples the parameter space and captures the overall dynamic behavior by analyzing the number and stability of steady states and the shapes of the assembly of nullclines, which are determined as projections of quasi-steady-state trajectories into different 2D spaces of system variables. Our pipeline allows identifying main qualitative features of the model behavior, perform bifurcation analysis, and determine the borders separating the different dynamical regimes within the assembly of 2D parametric planes. Partial differential equation (PDE) systems describing the nonlinear spatiotemporal behavior are derived by coupling fixed point dynamics with species diffusion. Keywords: Cell signaling, Nonlinear dynamics, Multistability, Oscillations, Bifurcations, Ordinary and partial differential equations\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\n1.  Build an ODE model of the signaling network based on the available topology of interactions between nodes. Implement the model in a software package that supports export to the SBML format, such as COPASI (Hoops et al., 2006) or BioNetGen (Blinov et al., 2004; Harris et al., 2016).a.  If the kinetics of interactions between two nodes is known, this network connection is modeled mechanistically.b.  For other connections, the interaction kinetics might not yet be exact mechanistically characterized, or these connections operate via intermediate species that are not included in the network under study. These connections are modeled using hyperbolic multipliers alpha_i j that specify the negative or positive influence of the activity (x_j) of node j on the activity (x54_i) of node i (Tsyganov et al., 2012; Bolado-Carrancio et al., 2020),alpha_i j=frac1+gamma_i j x_j/K_j1+x_j/K_jThe coefficient gamma_i j>1 indicates activation; gamma_i j<1 inhibition; and gamma_i j=1 denotes the absence of regulatory interactions, in which case the modifying multiplier alpha_i j equals 1. K_i j is the activation or inhibition constant.c.  Specify the parameter ranges using the data on the protein abundances and kinetic constants and assign numerical values to model parameters. d.  Non-dimensionalize the model to reduce the number of parameters (Barenblatt, 2003). e.  Export the model to SBML format. Determine dynamical regimes that can be observed in the system. a.  Import the sbml-file of the model into the DYVIPAC package. Sample parameter space of the model using the DYVIPAC package, which determines the number and stability of steady states for a given set of parameters.b.  Rank protein abundances in a model in descending order and pick two proteins (nodes) with the highest abundance. Using the QSS approximation for the other protein activities (Sauro and Kholodenko, 2004; Eilertsen and Schnell, 2020), derive a 2D model from the initial ODE model.c.  Based on the specification of the steady states and the analysis of the shapes of nullclines (Figure 2, for example), determine the dynamic regimes and validate these regimes by the integration of ODEs.()Figure 2. Examples of the nullcline analysis. Nullclines and vector fields calculated for 2D ODE system are derived from a five-dimensional ODE system using a quasi-steadystate approximation. Circles show stable steady states; triangles represent unstable steady states. Red and blue curves are nullclines for variables x_1 and x2, respectively. Green line represents trajectories of limit cycles projected from the original five-dimensional system to 2D space of x_1 and _×2 see Bolado-Carrancio et al. (2020) for details.d.  If more than two proteins have high and comparable abundances, make a list of pairs of these proteins and apply the above point c) to the ODE system for each pair.3.  Scan 2D parametric planes and determine the types of bifurcations that can occur in the system. a.  Scan the parameter planes and determine the borders that separate different dynamic regimes (see Figure 3, for example). This step can predict the previously unobserved dynamic regimes, which must be validated in the experiments.()Figure 3. Examples of 2D parametric scans. Different 2D parametric diagrams obtained using scanning of 2-parameter planes. Different colors indicate different dynamical regimes. Black lines represent borders between these regimes where bifurcations happen (see Bolado-Carrancio et al., 2020 for details and Figure 2 there).b.  The analysis of the changes in the number and stability of steady states can reveal local bifurcations, such as the Andronov-Hopf or saddle-node bifurcations (Kuznetsov, 2004). However, non-local bifurcations might exist in a 2D system where a limit cycle can appear or vanish (Nekorkin, 2015). Scan the parameters for dynamic regimes that contain focuses to determine the appearance or annihilation of limit cycles.4.  If there are time-series data, fine-tune model parameters to reproduce the system trajectories for a biologically relevant regime. This step uses standard software packages for parameter optimization (Glover et al., 2000; Maiwald and Timmer, 2008; Kreutz and Timmer, 2009; Penas et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2016; Degasperi et al., 2017; Mitra et al., 2018 and 2019).5.  Derive a PDE system by adding the terms describing mass transfer processes such as diffusion and convection to the ODE system studied (Tsyganov et al., 2012; Bolado-Carrancio et al., 2020).  Perform  spatiotemporal  simulations  using  specific  software  packages,  such  as OpenFOAM, FiPy, or Virtual Cell.A set of examples that illustrate the analysis of the dynamics of the RhoA-Rac1 signaling network model and python scripts can be found in “examples.zip” archive.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Build an ODE Model of the Signaling Network\nImplement the model in a software package that supports export to the SBML format, such as COPASI or BioNetGen.\n## Model Network Connections\nIf the kinetics of interactions between two nodes is known, model this network connection mechanistically.\nFor other connections, model the interaction kinetics using hyperbolic multipliers alpha_i j.\n## Specify Hyperbolic Multipliers\nThe coefficient gamma_i j indicates activation, inhibition, or absence of regulatory interactions.\nSpecify the parameter ranges using the data on the protein abundances and kinetic constants.\n## Parameterize and Non-Dimensionalize the Model\nAssign numerical values to model parameters.\nNon-dimensionalize the model to reduce the number of parameters.\nExport the model to SBML format.\n## Determine Dynamical Regimes\nImport the SBML-file of the model into the DYVIPAC package.\n## Sample Parameter Space\nSample parameter space of the model using the DYVIPAC package.\nDetermine the number and stability of steady states for a given set of parameters.\n## Derive a 2D Model\nRank protein abundances in a model in descending order and pick two proteins with the highest abundance.\nUsing the QSS approximation for the other protein activities, derive a 2D model from the initial ODE model.\n## Analyze Dynamic Regimes\nDetermine the dynamic regimes based on the specification of the steady states and the analysis of the shapes of nullclines.\nValidate these regimes by the integration of ODEs.\n## Scan 2D Parametric Planes\nScan the parameter planes and determine the borders that separate different dynamic regimes.\n## Analyze Bifurcations\nThe analysis of the changes in the number and stability of steady states can reveal local bifurcations.\nScan the parameters for dynamic regimes that contain focuses to determine the appearance or annihilation of limit cycles.\n## Fine-Tune Model Parameters\nIf there are time-series data, fine-tune model parameters to reproduce the system trajectories for a biologically relevant regime.\nUse standard software packages for parameter optimization.\n## Derive a PDE System and Perform Spatiotemporal Simulations\nDerive a PDE system by adding the terms describing mass transfer processes to the ODE system studied.\nPerform spatiotemporal simulations using specific software packages, such as OpenFOAM, FiPy, or Virtual Cell.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Bioinformatics Methods"}}

Qualitative mitochondrial morphology assay; and G. Quantitative mitochondrial fusion assay).1.  Using a PAP pen, draw circles of 1-1.5 cm in diameter on the microscope slides. Note: One standard slide will easily fit two grease circles, with room to cover each individually (when using 22×22 mm square cover slips).2.  Allow to dry overnight (or >2h in lamellar flow hood).B.  Prepare males1.  Maintain the growth of males in the strains needed for the assay.a.  Thirty to forty males are needed for sperm number assay; at least five males are needed per replicate of sperm size, activation, and mitochondrial assays. This number is easily obtained from a mixed population of males and hermaphrodites. To ensure the propagation of males in the strains used, transfer young adult males and hermaphrodites (3:1 ratio) to fresh plates 4-5 days prior to picking males for the assay.b.  If mating ability and/or male fertility is impaired, males should be mated to hermaphrodites (3:1 ratio) overnight on NGM plates seeded with 20 μl of 25× OP50-1 (see Recipe 1i Note for further detail) and transferred to stock NGM plates. The smaller food spots increase the frequency of encounters between males and hermaphrodites, thus increasing the likelihood of successful mating. Mate animals 4-5 days prior to picking males for the assay.c.  If larger numbers of animals are desired, populations can be synchronized by alkaline hypochlorite treatment of a mixed population of males and hermaphrodites as described before (Yen and Curran, 2020). To ensure you have enough males, only use populations with approximately 50% of males.2.  Pick larval stage 4 (L4) virgin males to stock NGM plates free of hermaphrodites on the day prior to assay (consult WormAtlas (Altun et al., 2021) for further information on identifying L4 males).a.  Picking L4 males ensures that premature activation does not occur via mating prior to the assays. Males should be prepared in this way for all assays, except for qualitative mitochondrial morphology, for which the MitoTracker dye should be applied to food prior to transferring males to the plates (see Procedure F).b.  Males tend to crawl off plates in search of hermaphrodites if isolated for too long; if this becomes a problem, some loss of males can be prevented by allowing hermaphrodites (preferably gravid, unmated ones) to crawl on seeded NGM to scent it with pheromones and removing them before transferring males to plate.3.  Incubate for 18-24~h~ at ^20^°C .# C.  Sperm number assay1.  Wash male worms from isolation plate with P B S+0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST) in a 1.5ml tube.2.  Centrifuge for 1 min at 560×g. . Remove supernatant to 0.1 m (use marks on the tube as a guide).3.  Wash 1-2 additional times with PBST. Note: These washes remove E. coli from the worms to be stained. Wash until the supernatant removed is clear (and not cloudy with bacteria). Do not wash beyond this point. Additional washes increase the likelihood of losing worms while aspirating the supernatant.4.  Centrifuge for 1 min at 560×g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 m .5.  Add 600ul of 40% isopropanol and rotate for 3 min at room temperature to fix worms.6.  While worms are fixing, make staining solution: dilute 1 mg/ml DAPI stock solution to 10 u/ml in 40% isopropanol ( 10~uI DAPI per 1  m l 40% isopropanol).7.  Centrifuge for 1 min at 560×g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 m .8.  Add 600ul of staining solution and incubate in the dark for 5 min.9.  Centrifuge for 1 min at 560×g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 m .10. Add 600 μl PBST and incubate in the dark for 30 min to destain.11. Mount samples on microscope slides (regular slides, not those prepared in Procedure A) with Vectashield mounting medium.12. Cover with a cover slip and seal the edges with nail polish. Allow to dry (in the dark) for 5-10 min.13. Image at 40–63× with DIC and DAPI filters, ensuring all spermatids are visible in each worm. Note: Spermatids should be restricted to the seminal vesicle in male worms and can be distinguished from other germ cells by their compact nuclei.14. Collect z-stacks of each seminal vesicle, ensuring all spermatids are captured (use 40× if needed to zoom out to include all spermatids). A representative image is shown in Figure 1. Note: Set bounds at upper and lower edges of the seminal vesicle (where the first spermatid is visible on each side of the seminal vesicle) and image at a z-plane distance of 0.25 microns. This distance is determined by the auto settings of the Zeiss imaging software.()Figure 1. DAPI-stained spermatids in the seminal vesicle. The worm is positioned with the anterior region to the left and posterior to the right. The seminal vesicle is outlined in yellow. Scale bar, 20um .# D.  Sperm size assay1.  Clean worms to get rid of E. coli.Cleaning can be done in one of two ways. For the first method, pipet two drops of 15~ul M9 onto a Petri dish lid and use a platinum wire worm pick to transfer 5 day one adult virgin males to a drop of M9. Using an eyelash brush, transfer the worms into the second M9 drop before moving them into the SM buffer on the prepared slide. For the second method, use a platinum pick to transfer >5 day one adult virgin males to an unseeded NGM plate and allow them to crawl from the food spot. Then use a clean platinum pick (without bacteria) to transfer 5 males from the unseeded plate to the SM buffer on the prepared slide. Carefully move the worms individually at each transfer step. Picking up worms without food requires practice and is done in a scooping motion where the pick goes below the worm.2.  Pipet 35~ul of SM buffer containing dextrose into the grease circle on the prepared slide (from Procedure A).3.  Transfer 5 clean virgin males to the SM buffer on the slide using either an eyelash brush or a platinum pick, depending on how the animals were cleaned (see Step D1).4.  Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms to release the sperm.a.  Using a scalpel or two 25-gauge needles (slide flat surfaces of needles across each other mimicking scissor blades), slice males between the midpoint and tail (approximately 1/3 body length from the tail). Note: Move rapidly as dissected sperm may be sensitive to changes in salt concentration and/or pH resulting from evaporation.b.  Sterilize the scalpel or needles between samples by dipping in ge70% ethanol and passing through a Bunsen burner flame. Allow to cool before use.5.  Cover dissected spermatids with a cover slip.6.  Seal with nail polish.7.  Image with a 100× objective using a DIC filter. A representative image is shown in Figure 2.a.  Complete imaging as quickly as possible because spontaneous activation has been observed when isolated spermatids are left for prolonged periods. In experienced hands, this should take no more than 5 min.b.  Score only spherical cells and at least 100 per replicate. Note: Typically, 100 spermatids are easy to obtain from one slide of five dissected day one adult males. This is attainable from imaging approximately 5-10 fields. The number of fields imaged depends on how the dissection spreads them on the slides. It may help to keep a rough mental count on the number of spermatids while imaging; always take a few extra images.()Figure 2. DIC image of isolated spermatids for size analysis. One spermatid has been outlined (in yellow) in ImageJ for size analysis. Scale bar, 10 um .# E.  Sperm activation assay1.  Prepare a humid chamber (Figure 3) a.  Place a wet paper towel on the bottom of a lidded container. Cover with a sheet of parafilm to create a dry surface to place slides on. b.  Cover with the lid.()Figure 3. DIY humid chamber in open (A) and closed (B) configurations2.  Prepare the Pronase working solution (see Recipes) and SM containing BSA and 400 n g/u l of Pronase. After the Pronase working solution is completely dissolved, dilute 4~ul in 96~ul of SM buffer containing BSA.3.  Clean worms to remove E. coli (see Procedure D for details).4.  Pipet 35~ul of SM buffer containing BSA into the grease circle on the prepared slide (from Procedure A). Note: Activation assays are done using SM buffer containing BSA rather than Dextrose. We have tested with both supplements and noted that BSA is needed for activation.5.  Transfer 5 clean virgin males to the SM buffer on the slide using either an eyelash brush or a platinum pick, depending on how animals were cleaned (see Step D1a).6.  Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms to release the sperm (see Procedure D for instructions).7.  After dissecting the final male, add 35ul of SM buffer containing BSA and 400 n g/u l Pronase.8.  Incubate in the humid chamber (covered) for 15~m i n . Note: In our hands, 15 min activates approximately 80% of WT spermatids, but the activation is sensitive to multiple factors, including handling time, temperature, and freshness of buffer components. The incubation length may need to be determined empirically on an individual basis.9.  During the incubation, prepare the cover slip. a.  Using forceps or a pipette tip, create a thin line of petroleum jelly around the edges of the coverslip.Note: We have found that sealing the slides with nail polish affects activation and thus use only petroleum jelly to seal slides for this assay.10. After 15 min, cover the dissected animals with the prepared cover slip. Do not seal further.11. Image with a 100× objective using a DIC filter. A representative image is shown in Figure 4. Notes:a.  Because sperm may be in different focal planes, and pseudopods of activated spermatids may be difficult to see in a single image, we recommend imaging each field of view in two different focal planes to aid in scoring (this distance need not be precisely measured). The second image serves as an aid in determining the activation status of spermatids that are unclear in the first one. Often, the movement of pseudopods in the time between capturing the images also helps reveal details that might not be evident in a single image.b.  Because the cover slip is adhered to the slide using only surface tension, changing objectives after oil immersion may cause it to shift or come off completely. For this reason, examine the slide using a lower magnification (non-oil immersion) objective before imaging. Do not return to a lower power objective after immersion oil is applied.a.  Ensure all imaging is complete within the first 5 min after the incubation is complete (20 min after adding SM/Pronase solution).b.  Score at least 100 spermatids per replicate.()Figure 4.

Be careful to avoid completely removing the liquid from dissected spermatids, as this will affect spermatid physiology (and therefore mitochondrial phenotypes).b.  Be careful to avoid overflowing the grease circle and losing the sample. If necessary, use smaller wash volumes (80-90~uI) .10.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1098","title":"Detecting Differentially Methylated Promoters in Genes Related to Disease Phenotypes Using R","text":"Detecting Differentially Methylated Promoters in Genes Related to Disease Phenotypes Using R\n\n# Abstract\n\nDNA methylation in gene promoters plays a major role in gene expression regulation, and alterations in methylation patterns have been associated with several diseases. In this context, different software suites and statistical methods have been proposed to analyze differentially methylated positions and regions. Among them, the novel statistical method implemented in the mCSEA R package proposed a new framework to detect subtle, but consistent, methylation differences. Here, we provide an easy-to-use pipeline covering all the necessary steps to detect differentially methylated promoters with mCSEA from Illumina 450K and EPIC methylation BeadChips data. This protocol covers the download of data from public repositories, quality control, data filtering and normalization, estimation of cell type proportions, and statistical analysis. In addition, we show the procedure to compare disease vs. normal phenotypes, obtaining differentially methylated regions including promoters or C p G Islands. The entire protocol is based on R programming language, which can be used in any operating system and does not require advanced programming skills.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  Install the necessary R packages1.  The required packages to run this pipeline can be installed from CRAN and from Bioconductor repositories using the following commands in an R terminal:install.packages(\"ggfortify\")if (requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"BiocManager\")BiocManager::install(c(\"GEOquery\", \"minfi\", \"M3C\", \"DMRcate\",watermelon\", \"FlowSorted.Blood.450k\", \"mCSEA\"))B.  Download raw data1.  Figure 1 shows a diagram of the data analysis workflow. Illumina’s BeadChip arrays raw data are idat files containing the fluorescence intensities at each microarray spot. These idat files can be downloaded from the public Gene Expression Repository GEO (Edgar et al., 2002) using the GEOquery package (Davis and Meltzer, 2007). In this protocol, we are going to analyze data reported by Strong et al. (2015) that can be retrieved using the GEO identifier GSE66552. In an R session, execute the following code:library(GEOquery) getGEOSuppFiles(\"GSE66552\")2.  When the download finishes, there will be a folder in the current directory with the compressed data. Use this code to uncompress the data into the IDAT folder:3.  Finally, save the metadata of the experiment into a variable called pheno:GEOData <- getGEO(\"GSE66552\") pheno <- pData(phenoData(GEOData1))()Figure 1. Data analysis workflow. Black boxes contain the inputs, outputs, and intermediate files. Blue boxes contain the steps described in this protocol.# C.  Read idat files1.  Minfi package (Aryee et al., 2014) can be used to read the idat files and manipulate the methylation data. For this aim, a target dataframe should be created from the experiment metadata. Table 1 contains the first 5 rows of this dataset to show the structure that this object should have.# library(minfi)basenames_split <- strsplit(phenosupplementary_file, \"suppl/\") basenames <- sapply(basenames_split, function (oldmath~x~) return(x2)) targets  <-  data.frame(\"Sample_Name\" = phenotitle,  \"Basename\" = basenames)Table 1. First 5 rows of the target dataframe()2.  Read the data and store it in a RGChannelSet object that will be used for later analyses. RGChannelSet is the class used by minfi to store the raw methylation data. The sample names in this object may also be specified in this step.rgchannelset <- read.metharray.exp(targets = targets, base = \"IDAT\") sampleNames(rgchannelset) <- targetsSample_NameD.  Perform quality control (QC)1.  To check that there are no technical problems affecting any samples, QC steps should be performed. Minfi package includes a function to explore the median intensities of unmethylated and methylated channels of each sample. Low intensities may indicate problems with a sample. Figure 2A shows the output plot of this QC. In this case, there are no samples failing this QC. If any sample fails this QC, it should be discarded from the analyses.msetraw <- preprocessRaw(rgchannelset)qc <- getQC(msetraw)plotQC(qc)2.  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is also a recommended QC step to detect potential outliers. To this end, M3C (John et al., 2020) and ggfortify (Yuan et al., 2016) R packages can be used. Figure 2B shows the PCA plot for our example. As can be observed, there are no outlier samples and the groups are partially separated. The observable mixing between groups may be due to covariates such as gender, age, or ancestry of the patients.library(M3C)library(ggfortify)betas.raw <- getBeta(msetraw)phenoPCA <- data.frame(\"Group\" = pheno`group:ch1`, stringsAsFactors =F)pcaResult <- prcomp(t(na.omit(betas.raw)), scale. = TRUE)autoplot(pcaResult, data = phenoPCA, colour = \"Group\")()Figure 2. Quality control of methylation data. (A) Minfi QC with the median unmethylated and methylated signal intensities of each sample. (B) PCA plot representing the first two principal components. Samples are colored by experimental group.E.  Preprocess data1.  To correct for technical biases and improve the data quality, it is essential to filter some probes and apply normalization methods. Minfi preprocessNoob function applies Noob (normalexponential out-of-band), a background correction with dye-bias normalization (Triche et al., 2013). The output of this normalization is a MethylSet object containing the methylated and unmethylated signals for each C p G probe. This object can be transformed to a RatioSet class where  -values are stored instead of signals. Finally, a GenomicRatioSet object containing the  -values mapped to the genome should be created. The GenomicRatioSet is the necessary class for further analyses.mset <- preprocessNoob(rgchannelset)rset <- ratioConvert(mset)grset <- mapToGenome(rset)2.  Subsequently, a detection P-value can be obtained for each probe and sample. This P. -value is calculated by comparing the probe signal to the background signal measured using negative control probes. A detection P. -value >0.01 indicates an untrustworthy signal. A filter step can be applied to remove those probes with a detection P. -value >0.01 in a percentage of samples (in this case, at least 10% of samples).detectionPvalues <- detectionP(rgchannelset) detectionPvalues <- detectionPvaluesrownames(grset), propGood <- apply(detectionPvalues, 1, function(x)  length(xwhich( x<001. ))/ncol(detectionPvals) )grset <- grsetwhich(propGood >= 09; ),3.  It is recommended to remove those probes that are located in sex chromosomes (only if both male and female samples are included) (Maksimovic et al., 2017), probes containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Naeem et al., 2014), and cross-reactive probes (Chen et al., 2013). DMRCate package (Peters et al., 2015) contains the convenient function rmSNPandCH, which can be used to filter all these probes in one step:library(DMRcate)beta.noob <- getBeta(grset)beta.noob.filtered <- rmSNPandCH(beta.noob, rmXY = TRUE)4.  Finally, Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization may be applied to mitigate the systematic differences between type I and type II probe designs present in 450K and EPIC arrays (Teschendorff et al., 2013). For this purpose, the wateRmelon package (Pidsley et al., 2013) may be used:library(wateRmelon)annot <- getAnnotation(rgchannelset)probeTypeas.data.frame(annotrownames(beta.noob.filtered),c(\"Name\",\"Type\"))probeType <- ifelse(probeTypeType %in% \"I\",1,2)beta.normalized <- apply(beta.noob.filtered, 2, function(x)wateRmelon::BMIQ(x, design.v = probeType) varsigma nbeta)F.  Estimate cell type heterogeneity1.  One of the major sources of variability in blood methylation data is the different cell type proportions across samples (McGregor et al., 2016). In this context, reference data from the FlowSorted.Blood.450k package can be used to estimate these proportions in each sample. In the case of data generated with the EPIC platform, FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC package should be used instead.library(FlowSorted.Blood.450k) cellCounts <- estimateCellCounts(rgchannelset)2.  The cellCounts object is a matrix that can be merged with the experimental metadata to consider these estimations as covariates in further analyses:pheno = merge(pheno, cellCounts, by.x = \"title\", by.y = \"row.names\") rownames(pheno) <- phenotitleG.  Identify differentially methylated promoters.  One of the most common methylation analyses is to detect regions that show different methylation levels across phenotypes, known as Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs). To this end, different statistical procedures have been developed, most of which are based on wellestablished methodologies such as linear models (Ritchie et al., 2015). In this protocol, we use the mCSEA package (Martorell-Marugán et al., 2019) to perform a DMRs analysis focusing on promoter regions. The first step is to rank C p G probes according to their differential methylation across conditions using linear models. In these models, available covariates (e.g., the estimated cell type proportions) can be included to adjust their possible effect on the data. Here, we are first analyzing the WS vs. TD control comparison:library(mCSEA)phenoComp <- pheno,c(\"group:ch1\",\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\",\"Gran\")rankedCpGs1 <- rankProbes(beta.normalized, phenoComp, refGroup = \"TD control\", caseGroup = \"WS\", covariates = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\",\"Gran\"), continuous = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\",\"Gran\"))2.  The following step is used to calculate the differentially methylated promoters. The output object is a dataframe with gene symbols as row names, estimated P-values in the pval column, and P-values adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) in the padj column. In addition, given that the mCSEA algorithm is based on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005), the Enrichment Score (ES) is provided for each gene. The sign of this score indicates whether the promoter is hypermethylated (positive sign) or hypomethylated (negative sign) in the case group as compared with the controls. Finally, the Normalized ES (NES) and the amount of C p G s in each promoter are reported in the NES and size columns, respectively. Table 2 shows the first 20 rows of results_promoters1 object. In the case of EPIC data, the parameter platfor n=^iotaiotaE P/C^ should be added to the mCSEATest function. Furthermore, the regionsTypes parameter can be modified to “genes” or “CGI” to analyze the gene bodies and CGIs, respectively.set.seed(123) results_mCSEA1 <- mCSEATest(rankedCpGs1, beta.normalized,phenoComp, regionsTypes = \"promoters\")results_promoters1results_mCSEA1promotersorder(results_mCSEA1promoterspadj), -c(3,7) Table 2. Top 20 differentially methylated promoters in WS vs. TD control comparison.Promoters are sorted by their adjusted P. -value.()3.  Perform the same analysis for Dup7 vs. TD control comparison:rankedCpGs2 <- rankProbes(beta.normalized, phenoComp, refGroup = \"TD control\", caseGroup = \"Dup7\", covariates = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\",\"Gran\"), continuous = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\",\"Gran\"))set.seed(123)results_mCSEA2 <- mCSEATest(rankedCpGs2, beta.normalized,phenoComp, regionsTypes = \"promoters\")results_promoters2 results_mCSEA2promotersorder(results_mCSEA2promoterspadj), -c(3,7)4.  Furthermore, methylation values can be represented for any promoter in their genomic context. Figure 3A shows the result of this plot for the CRISP2 gene, whose promoter is hypermethylated in WS patients and hypomethylated in Dup7 patients. To construct these plots, use the mCSEAPlot function:mCSEAPlot(results_mCSEA1, \"promoters\", \"CRISP2\", makePDF = F, leadingEdge Sigma=SigmaF. )5.  Finally, a GSEA plot can also be generated for each promoter. In this plot, all the analyzed CpGs are ordered by their differential methylation on the x axis, and vertical lines mark the CpGs belonging to the represented promoter. Figure 3B contains the CRISP2 GSEA plot, which can be generated with the mCSEAPlotGSEA function:mCSEAPlotGSEA(rankedCpGs1, results_mCSEA1, \"promoters\", \"CRISP2\")()Figure 3. mCSEA plots for the CRISP2 gene.

(B) GSEA plot for the CRISP2 promoter in WS vs. TD control comparison. Vertical lines mark the location of CRISP2 promoter CpGs along the list of analyzed CpGs (horizontal black line).# Conclusions:In this protocol, we show how to perform the whole analysis of Illumina BeadChip methylation data to identify differentially methylated promoters in disease samples using R packages. This protocol can be directly applied to any case-control study design. Furthermore, it can be easily adopted to study differential methylation in other regions such as gene bodies and CGIs. We are confident that this workflow will be useful for researchers studying methylation alterations associated with different disorders.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Install the necessary R packages\nInstall the required packages from CRAN and Bioconductor repositories using the following commands in an R terminal: install.packages(\"ggfortify\")\nInstall BiocManager package using the command: if (requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nInstall the necessary packages using BiocManager: BiocManager::install(c(\"GEOquery\", \"minfi\", \"M3C\", \"DMRcate\", \"watermelon\", \"FlowSorted.Blood.450k\", \"mCSEA\"))\n## Download raw data\nDownload the raw data from the public Gene Expression Repository GEO using the GEOquery package\nUse the GEO identifier GSE66552 to retrieve the data: getGEOSuppFiles(\"GSE66552\")\nUncompress the data into the IDAT folder\nSave the metadata of the experiment into a variable called pheno: GEOData <- getGEO(\"GSE66552\"), pheno <- pData(phenoData(GEOData1))\n## Read idat files\nCreate a target dataframe from the experiment metadata using the minfi package\nRead the data and store it in a RGChannelSet object: rgchannelset <- read.metharray.exp(targets = targets, base = \"IDAT\")\nSpecify the sample names in the RGChannelSet object: sampleNames(rgchannelset) <- targets$Sample_Name\n## Perform quality control (QC)\nCheck for technical problems affecting any samples using the minfi package: msetraw <- preprocessRaw(rgchannelset), qc <- getQC(msetraw), plotQC(qc)\nPerform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to detect potential outliers: library(M3C), library(ggfortify), betas.raw <- getBeta(msetraw), phenoPCA <- data.frame(\"Group\" = pheno$`group:ch1`, stringsAsFactors = F), pcaResult <- prcomp(t(na.omit(betas.raw)), scale. = TRUE), autoplot(pcaResult, data = phenoPCA, colour = \"Group\")\n## Preprocess data\nApply Noob normalization using the minfi package: mset <- preprocessNoob(rgchannelset)\nTransform the MethylSet object to a RatioSet class: rset <- ratioConvert(mset)\nCreate a GenomicRatioSet object: grset <- mapToGenome(rset)\nObtain detection P-values for each probe and sample: detectionPvalues <- detectionP(rgchannelset)\nFilter out probes with a detection P-value > 0.01 in a percentage of samples: grset <- grset[which(propGood >= 0.9), ]\nRemove probes located in sex chromosomes, probes containing SNPs, and cross-reactive probes: library(DMRcate), beta.noob <- getBeta(grset), beta.noob.filtered <- rmSNPandCH(beta.noob, rmXY = TRUE)\nApply Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization: library(wateRmelon), annot <- getAnnotation(rgchannelset), probeType <- ifelse(probeType$Type %in% \"I\", 1, 2), beta.normalized <- apply(beta.noob.filtered, 2, function(x) wateRmelon::BMIQ(x, design.v = probeType) varsigma nbeta)\n## Estimate cell type heterogeneity\nUse the FlowSorted.Blood.450k package to estimate cell type proportions: library(FlowSorted.Blood.450k), cellCounts <- estimateCellCounts(rgchannelset)\nMerge the cellCounts object with the experimental metadata: pheno = merge(pheno, cellCounts, by.x = \"title\", by.y = \"row.names\"), rownames(pheno) <- pheno$title\n## Identify differentially methylated promoters\nRank CpG probes according to their differential methylation across conditions using linear models: library(mCSEA), phenoComp <- pheno[, c(\"group:ch1\", \"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\", \"Gran\")], rankedCpGs1 <- rankProbes(beta.normalized, phenoComp, refGroup = \"TD control\", caseGroup = \"WS\", covariates = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\", \"Gran\"), continuous = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\", \"Gran\"))\nCalculate the differentially methylated promoters: set.seed(123), results_mCSEA1 <- mCSEATest(rankedCpGs1, beta.normalized, phenoComp, regionsTypes = \"promoters\")\nPerform the same analysis for Dup7 vs. TD control comparison: rankedCpGs2 <- rankProbes(beta.normalized, phenoComp, refGroup = \"TD control\", caseGroup = \"Dup7\", covariates = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\", \"Gran\"), continuous = c(\"CD8T\", \"CD4T\", \"NK\", \"Bcell\", \"Mono\", \"Gran\")), set.seed(123), results_mCSEA2 <- mCSEATest(rankedCpGs2, beta.normalized, phenoComp, regionsTypes = \"promoters\")\nRepresent methylation values for any promoter in their genomic context: mCSEAPlot(results_mCSEA1, \"promoters\", \"CRISP2\", makePDF = F, leadingEdge Sigma=SigmaF)\nGenerate a GSEA plot for each promoter: mCSEAPlotGSEA(rankedCpGs1, results_mCSEA1, \"promoters\", \"CRISP2\")","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Bioinformatics Methods"}}

Their functions are essential to the survival or virulence of many species. PFTs often interact with lipid membranes. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), also known as liposomes, have been commonly used as reliable membrane models for testing PFTs activity. Liposomes have great adaptability in size, lipid composition, and loading cargo. Incorporating the fluorescent dye/quencher pair, 8-Aminonaphthalene1,3,6-Trisulfonic Acid (ANTS) and p-Xylene-Bis-Pyridinium Bromide (DPX), in liposomes is an effective approach for measuring membrane leakage. When ANTS and DPX are encapsulated in a liposome, the fluorescence of ANTS is quenched by DPX. However, disruption of liposome integrity and subsequent leakage result in measurable fluorescence emitted by ANTS. Here, we report our protocol for optimal liposome preparation for measuring liposome leakage by fluorescence dequenching.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Measure 50-150 mg of lipids into a glass vial with a screw cap.3.  Add 5-15~m of 3:2 chloroform:methanol as needed to maintain concentration at 10 mg/ml for ease of usage. Note: Cover the vial using PTFE lined caps; otherwise, the chloroform may dissolve plastics and contaminate the sample.4.  Measure the appropriate amount of lipids (10 mg will be enough for approximately 30 reactions) into a glass tube. Note:  Liposomes  can  be  made  of  single  lipid  forms  e.g.,  1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt)  (POPG),  and  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine  (POPC)  or  their combinations. For example, the Nj^2+ -chelating lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(N-(5-amino-1- carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl (nickel salt) or (DGS-NTA(Ni)), can attach Histagged proteins to the membranes (Sun et al., 2007 and 2008; Jacquez et al., 2014). The new liposome developed for measuring the MPA of EsxAB is composed of POPC to POPG at a 4:1 molar ratio.5.  Use a clamp stand to hold the vial in place.6.  Using a second clamp, position a Pasteur pipette approximately 2-5 mm away from the liquid in the tube.7.  Connect the tubing to the end of the Pasteur pipette and open the valve to allow gentle airflow.8.  Evaporate the chloroform from the vial until there is no liquid visible.9.  Remove the vial from the stand and place it inside a vacuum chamber at room temperature for at least 3h or overnight.10. Store the dry lipids at -20~^°C . Lipids may be stored under these conditions for up to a month.B.  Preparing column and FPLC for desalting1.  A 5-ml desalting column is needed for removing the excess ANTS/DPX and for buffer exchange.If necessary, two desalting columns can be connected in tandem to improve desalting results.2.  Pass at least 5 column volumes (CV) or, in this case, 50~ml of water through the column toremove the ethanol from the column.3.  Pass at least 5 CV (50 ml) of gel filtration buffer through the column.4.  Prepare the machine for desalting by passing 50ml of water through the machine at 5 ml/min.5.  Pass 50~ml of gel filtration buffer through the machine at 5ml/min .6.  Connect the column to the machine and pass an additional 100ml of gel filtration buffer.7.  Clean the injection valve by injecting 1 ml of gel filtration buffer.8.  Repeat Step B7 at least two more times.C.  Preparing the lipid-ANTS/DPX solution1.  Prepare a freezing solution in a beaker by adding dry ice to >95% ethanol. The freezing solution is used to flash freeze the lipids containing ANTS/DPX. Alternatively, liquid nitrogen can be used to flash freeze. It is ideal to keep the freezing solution below -50~^°C .2.  Fill another beaker with lukewarm water for thawing the lipids.3.  Re-suspend lipids in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 ml for every 10mg of lipids.4.  Vortex until the solution is well suspended.5.  Measure the solution volume and add 50~m M of ANTS and DPX into the tube.6.  Mix by pipetting up and down and cover the tube with aluminum foil.7.  Place the tube into the freezing solution and allow it to freeze.8.  Move the tube into warm water to thaw the lipids.9.  Repeat Steps C7-C8 for five more freeze/thaw cycles. Note: Six freeze/thaw cycles are usually sufficient to solubilize the lipids. If problems occur during the extrusion, such as difficulties in passing the liquid through the membranes, perform more freeze/thaw cycles.D.  Producing liposomes via extrusion1.  Assemble the extruder according to the manufacturer’s specifications.2.  Draw up 1 ml of gel filtration buffer using one of the syringes and pass the buffer through the extruder until the liquid has been transferred to the other syringe. Note: You should feel a little bit of resistance. If there is no resistance, it is possible the membrane has moved during assembly or has torn.3.  Remove the buffer from the syringe.4.  Draw up to 1 ml of liposomes into one of the syringes.5.  Pass the liposomes through the membrane until the liquid has been transferred from one syringe to the other.6.  Repeat Step D5 for a total of 20 times.7.  Inspect the fluid after extrusion; it should have changed from an opaque to a transparent, yellowtinged liquid (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Comparison of the lipid solution before and after extrusion. A. The lipid solution before extrusion has an opaque color. B. The lipid solution becomes more transparent after extrusion.8.  Dispense the lipids into a clean glass tube.E.  Removal of excess fluorescent dyes via desalting chromatography1.  After pre-equilibration of the column and machine and cleaning the injection loop, inject the liposomes into the injection loop.2.  Run the desalting program at a 0.5ml/min flow rate, using gel filtration buffer, and collect 0.5m per fraction.3.  Allow 50~ml of buffer to pass through the column.4.  The liposomes will be eluted out of the column after approximately 2 ml have passed through.5.  Collect fractions containing the liposomes, usually in six tubes for a total 3 ml of liposomes (Figure 2).6.  Combine all liposome samples, cover with aluminum foil, and store at 4^°C .7.  Liposomes at this stage can be stored for approximately 1-3 weeks.8.  Liposomes prepared with this procedure are usually consistent in concentration. However, technical replicates with the same batch of lipids are needed for every biological replicate to obtain consistent results.9.  Clean the column by passing at least 5CV+30ml (the volume of the machine) of water through the machine.()Figure 2. Most lipids will elute after flowing approximately pmb2m of buffer through the column. A typical yield of 3ml is expected using this procedure. The blue line represents mAu, and the brown line represents conductance.10. Pass at least five CV in addition to 30m of 20% ethanol through the machine for column storage.# F.  Liposome leakage assay1.  The quality of the liposomes should be tested before analyzing the protein of interest by adding 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, which completely lyses the liposomes, quickly revealing a strong fluorescence signal.2.  Set fluorometer excitation to 350n m and record emissions at 520nm and continue to measure at  -second intervals for 5-10~m i n .3.  Cross polarizers are applied at the excitation and emission paths to reduce background. If necessary, apply a 515 nm long-pass filter at the emission path to reduce background scatter.4.  If available, connect a water bath to the water inlet and outlet of the sample chamber to maintain a constant temperature. This is especially important with proteins that interact at the physiological temperature, as is the case with EsxAB.5.  To a UV cuvette, add 1.15ml of gel filtration buffer, 150~ul of 1 M NaAc buffer (pH 4), and 100 ul of liposomes.6.  Place the sample cuvette inside the sample chamber and close the lid.7.  After approximately _30 s , use a gel loading pipette tip to inject 100~ul of 2% Triton X-100 into the cuvette through the hole on the cover lid. The ANTS fluorescence should increase at least 5-fold (Figure 3). This will serve as a positive control. a.  The fluorescence intensity will drop for a second or two due to the dilution of the mix inside the cuvette, but it will begin to rise shortly after. b.  A negative control consists of the sample prepared with liposomes and the gel filtration buffer.8.  Continue experimenting by testing cytolytic proteins; prepare the cuvette as in Step F5 (Figure 3).()Time (s)Figure 3. Raw plots of an ANTS/DPX assay. The background fluorescence intensity is approximately 100,000 units. The fluorescence intensity increased 5-fold after adding 2% Triton X-100. With EsxA, a protein known to have MPA, we observed a gradual increase in fluorescence. EsxB, a protein without MPA, did not increase fluorescence intensity. The negative control consisting of the only gel filtration buffer did not increase fluorescence intensity.9.  Place the UV cuvette in the sample chamber and close the lid.10. After about _30s , use a gel loading pipette tip to add 100ul of protein into the cuvette. a.  Protein concentrations can vary, but a total of 100u is usually used in our experiments. b.  Depending on the nature of the experiment, the protein can be loaded into the cuvette instead of the p H4 buffer. Then, after 30s , adding the p H4 buffer will cause EsxAB to lyse the membrane.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Drying Phospholipids\nCreate a lipid stock solution if working with lipid powders.\nMeasure 50-150 mg of lipids into a glass vial with a screw cap.\nAdd 5-15 mL of 3:2 chloroform:methanol as needed to maintain concentration at 10 mg/ml.\nMeasure the appropriate amount of lipids (10 mg will be enough for approximately 30 reactions) into a glass tube.\n## Lipid Preparation\nUse a combination of single lipid forms or their combinations, such as DOPC, POPG, and POPC.\nFor example, the Nj^2+ -chelating lipid, DGS-NTA(Ni), can attach His-tagged proteins to the membranes.\nUse a clamp stand to hold the vial in place.\nPosition a Pasteur pipette approximately 2-5 mm away from the liquid in the tube.\nConnect the tubing to the end of the Pasteur pipette and open the valve to allow gentle airflow.\nEvaporate the chloroform from the vial until there is no liquid visible.\nRemove the vial from the stand and place it inside a vacuum chamber at room temperature for at least 3h or overnight.\nStore the dry lipids at -20°C.

Various biophysical methods exist to achieve this, including the whole toolbox of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR or ESR) spectroscopy. An EPR method widely used in this regard is Pulsed Electron-Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR or DEER), which provides distances in the nanometer range between electron spins in biomolecules with Angstrom precision, without restriction to the size of the biomolecule, and in solution. Since oligonucleotides inherently do not contain unpaired electrons, these have to be introduced in the form of so-called spin labels. Firstly, this protocol describes how nitroxide spin labels can be sitespecifically attached to oligonucleotides using “Click” chemistry. The reaction provides little byproducts, high yields, and is conveniently performed in aqueous solution. Secondly, the protocol details how to run the PELDOR experiment, analyze the data, and derive a coarse-grained structure. Here, emphasis is placed on the pitfalls, requirements for a good dataset, and limits of interpretation; thus, the protocol gives the user a guideline for the whole experiment i.e., from spin labeling, via the PELDOR measurement and data analysis, to the final coarse-grained structure.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: It is very important to set up an RNase-free environment.

For this protocol, the following sequence is used: 5′-GCG GGG ACG ACC CXG C-3′, with ×=5. -ethynyl- ^ -deoxyuridine The labeling position should not disturb the overall RNA structure or its function; thus, avoid labeling at catalytically active sites or binding pockets. To minimize possible perturbations, design the modified oligonucleotide strands by exchanging a naturally occurring uridine nucleotide  with  the  modified  5-ethynyl- ^ -deoxyuridine.  Moreover,  where  possible,  it  is preferable to integrate the modification into a double-stranded RNA region since this promotes narrow distance distributions. Note: Establish an RNase-free environment: Clean your bench and tools e.g., pipettes with 70% ethanol or RNase Away. Wear protective gloves throughout this workflow.2.  Aliquot the RNAa.  Dissolve the RNA oligonucleotide in DEPC-treated water (see Recipes).b.  Aliquot 2.5 nmol RNA into 1.5-m Eppendorf tubes (Note 1).c.  Dry the RNA oligonucleotide aliquots in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator or a freeze dryer. Store the dried RNA oligonucleotide aliquots at -20^°C .3.  Set up the RNA labeling reactiona.  Pre-heat the Thermomixer to 60^°C .b.  Dissolve the dried RNA oligonucleotide in 4.4~ul DEPC-treated water (see Recipes).c.  Weigh 1-2 mg CuI (X) into a _2-ml Eppendorf tube and calculate the volume of DMSO (Y), to obtain a 50m MC u^+ solution:frac×m g0.952g=Ymu# Read Note 2 before you continued.  Dissolve CuI in Y µl DMSO and immediately prepare the Cu^+ -complex by mixing together: 20 µl DMSO 8ul50m MC u^+ solution from the previous step 3.6 u 250  m M THPTA/DMSO solution Vortex the mixture and incubate for 5 min at room temperaturee.  Set up the labeling reaction by pipetting the following solutions into the 1.5ml Eppendorf tube containing the dissolved RNA (Step A3b): 2 µl spin label/DMSO solution, taken from the 100 mM stock solution 4.6 µl THPTA-Cu+ solution (Step A3d) Shortly vortex the reaction mixture and incubate the reaction at 300 rpm and 60^°C for 30 min (Note 3)4.  Desalt the RNA oligonucleotide and remove Cu^+ via an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devicea.  Add 480~ul DEPC-treated water to each reaction tube and transfer each solution to an Amicon Ultra-0.5 filter, previously inserted into an Amicon collection tube.b.  Spin and concentrate for 30 min at 14,000×g and room temperature.c.  Add 500~ul DEPC-treated water to the Amicon filter device and spin again for 30 m i n at room temperature and 14,000× g , discard the flowthrough.d.  Repeat Step A4c one more time.e.  For RNA recovery, turn the Amicon filter device around and insert it into a clean Amicon collection tube. Spin for 2 min at room temperature and 14,000× g .f. Pipette 50ul Milli-Q water into the Amicon filter device and wash the membrane by pipetting up and down or by vortexing. Then, place the filter device again upside down and spin for 2 min at room temperature and 14,000× g .g.  Wash the filter membrane again, as described in Step A4f, two more times. The sample volume should now be around 200~ul .h.  Determine the amount of RNA oligonucleotide (nRNA) using the NanoDrop: Clean the NanoDrop measurement pedestal with 70% ethanol using a light-duty tissue wiper. Using a pipette, transfer 1~ul DEPC-treated water onto the measurement pedestal and run a blank measurement as a reference. Clean the pedestal with a light-duty tissue wiper, pipette 1~ul RNA solution onto the measurement pedestal and measure the absorbance at 260 n m (Abs260nm). Then, calculate nRNA with the extinction coefficient (RNA), either provided by the vendor or calculated using an online tool such as the IDT OligoAnalizer Tool and the volume of your RNA oligonucleotide sample (VRNA) using:fracA b s_260n mfrac1c mpmbvarepsilon_R N Afrac1c mm o lV_R N AL=n_R N Am o lEvaporate the excess water from your RNA oligonucleotide sample, either with theSpeedVac vacuum concentrator or the freeze dryer, until you obtain a volume that does not exceed half of your HPLC-loop capacity. If using a 100ul injection loop, e.g., inject a volume of 30-50~ul .5.  Reversed-phase H P L C purificationa.  Start with the equilibration of your reversed-phase column. Therefore, re-buffer the column to 8% buffer A (acetonitrile) and 92% buffer B (0.1 M triethylammonium acetate).b.  Perform a blank run to check the purity of your column before you purify your sample: Load 30-50ul Milli-Q water with a Hamilton syringe into the injection loop and start the HPLC run. The blank run uses the same operation parameters as the purification run of your RNA sample. In general, you will need to fine-tune the HPLC run for each new RNA sequence. However, you can use the following settings as a starting point for RNA sequences shorter than 50 nucleotides: Elute with a gradient of 8%ongrightarrow25% buffer A for 20 min with a flow rate of 1.5ml/min . Then, equilibrate your column back to 8% buffer A. For short RNA sequences, use the analytical Zorbax 300SB-C18, 4.6×150mm column, but for sequences exceeding 50 nucleotides, use the preparative Zorbax 300SB-C18, 9.4×250~mm column. The elution profile for the preparative column is: Elute with 8% acetonitrile for 10 min and then apply a gradient of 8%arrow23% buffer A for 55 min with a constant flow rate of 2~ml/min . Finally, equilibrate your column back to 8% buffer A. It is important to heat your HPLC column to avoid the formation of tertiary RNA structures (Figure 2). Heat the column to 60^°C , also during the blank run, to ensure the same conditions.()Retention Time (min)Figure 2. Exemplary normalized HPLC chromatograms of unlabeled RNA at different column temperatures. Upon column heating, the formation of tertiary structures is inhibited, which leads to a single peak (black chromatogram).c.  Inject your RNA sample into the loop. Do not inject more than 2.5 nmol RNA to avoid column overloading. However, you should check the capacity and properties in the manufacturer’s instructions of the particular column you use.d.  Run the HPLC method.e.  Separately collect the fractions of unlabeled and labeled RNA. The collection can be performed manually or, if your HPLC is equipped with a fraction collector, automatically. If you use a fraction collector, you can set a constraint to collect everything that exceeds an absorbance of e.g., 15 mAU.f.  Pool each HPLC peak separately and concentrate the solutions in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator until you obtain a volume of about 500ul for each peak.g.  After the HPLC run has finished, proceed with the purification of your next sample or store the HPLC column. The storage of your column is achieved by rebuffering it to 80% buffer A.6.  Desalt the labeled RNA with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devicea.  Desalt the RNA samples using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device, as already described above in Steps A4a-A4h.b.  After desalting your RNA samples, concentrate them in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator until you reach the desired concentration. Yields of 50–70% with respect to the starting amount of RNA are usually obtained; the losses largely originate from the purification steps. The labeling itself is quantitative, as shown in the H P L C chromatograms (Figure 3).()Retention Time (min)Figure 3. Normalized chromatograms of different HPLC runs. A. Chromatogram obtained by injection of water (blank run). B. Chromatogram obtained by injection of unlabeled RNA. C. Chromatogram obtained by injection of RNA from a labeling reaction. From the chromatogram of the labeled RNA (C), it can be inferred that there is almost no unlabeled RNA left in the reaction mixture, as only a negligible peak at a retention time of ^2 min is obtained. For further purification, only the peak at a retention time of 10 m i n has been collected and used.7.  Determine the purity of your labeled RNA sequence via LC-MS (or HPLC and mass spectrometry separately)a.  Perform an LC-MS measurement of the unlabeled RNA, as a reference. The procedure is analogous to that of an H P L C run (equilibration of the column with buffer C, injection, run, and storage). Use a gradient of 5%ongrightarrow20% buffer D for 20 min with a constant flow rate of 0.4ml/min .b.  Perform an LC-MS measurement of the labeled RNA sample; use the gradient specified in Step A7a. Successful labeling can be checked by determining the exact mass of the species present in a specific LC peak.c.  If you do not have access to an LC-MS system, perform an analytical HPLC run and subject the fractions containing RNA to ESI-MS or MALDI-MS to determine the exact mass.8.  Determine the spin labeling efficiencya.  Determine the concentration of labeled RNA (c_R N A) using the NanoDrop (Step A4h).b.  Prepare 10~uI~25~uM RNA solution, if each RNA strand is singly labeled. If the RNA strand is doubly labeled, halve the RNA concentration.c.  Fill the solution into a 10ul capillary.d.  Perform a cw EPR measurement as described in the user’s manual of the EMXnano spectrometer. Use the “spin count” routine from Bruker to determine the spin concentration (c_s p i n) . Another way to determine the spin concentration is to doubly integrate the cw EPR spectrum and to relate this double integral value to that of a reference sample of known spin concentration. The error margin of both spin quantitation methods is 10-20% .e.  Calculate the labeling efficiency. For singly labeled RNA sequences, the efficiency is given by:fracC_S p i nC_R N A100=l a b e l i n g~e f f i c i e n c y~%For doubly labeled sequences, use:fracC_S p i n2C_R N A100=l a b e l i n ge f f i c i e n c y%f.  Keep in mind that although LC-MS reveals almost quantitative labeling, the yield of labeled RNA with respect to the starting RNA is 50–70% due to losses during purification.9.  Prepare the PELDOR samplea.  For singly labeled RNA, transfer 2.0 nmol into an Eppendorf tube and dry it in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator or freeze-dryer. Halve the amount for doubly labeled RNA.b.  Dissolve the RNA in 64 ul D_2O . Add 16 uI E G-0_6 as a cryoprotectant and mix the solution carefully in an Eppendorf tube. This yields a sample of 80~ul with a spin concentration of 25 mu M containing 20% v/v EG-d6 (Note 4). During PELDOR measurements, the resonator should be completely filled with your sample; thus, even if your RNA amount is scarce, avoid preparing samples with a volume less than 60~ul .c.  Fill the entire 80ul into a 3 mm outer diameter Q-band EPR tube with the Eppendorf pipette using the elongated pipette tips. Carefully shake the EPR tube such that the sample collects at the bottom.d.  Freeze the sample by carefully immersing the EPR tube into a Dewar vessel with liquid nitrogen. As EPR tubes may crack during freezing, wear safety goggles and use coldprotection gloves when handling liquid nitrogen. Keep the tube in the Dewar vessel with liquid nitrogen.# B.  PELDOR MeasurementsPrepare the ELEXSYS E580 Q-Band EPR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) for the PELDORmeasurement:As EPR spectrometers are sensitive devices that can be damaged upon operator errors, stickto this protocol and the instructions in the user manual of the instrument. In case of doubt, seekadvice from a more experienced colleague.a.  Connect the turbomolecular pump to the cryostat, switch on the pump, and evacuate the cryostat to a reduced pressure of 10^-4 mbar. Evacuating overnight may be helpful to reach the required vacuum conditions.b.  Switch on the heat exchanger of the spectrometer and check the temperature of the inward and return flow. Depending on the ambient temperature, the former should be around 10- 15^°C and the latter should not surpass 25-30^°C . If the spectrometer has a closed cooling circuit, check the water level in this system and refill if necessary.c.  Switch on the spectrometer console, the magnet power supply, and the TWT amplifier. It is important to keep the TWT in the Standby mode to prevent damage of the detection system. Give the system 1 h to warm-up before starting measurements as this ensures electronic stability of the spectrometer.d.  Connect the overflow valve of the helium tank to the helium recovery system, if available in your facility. Make sure that the gasflow through the tubing is not blocked (e.g., due to bending) and open the overflow valve on the helium tank to prevent pressure build-up.e.  From this step on, wear cold protection gloves and safety goggles Open the needle valve on the helium transfer line. Slowly 3 min for the whole procedure) insert the transfer line into the helium tank. As the transfer line enters the liquid helium, the gas meter will indicate a gasflow and occasionally, a hiss-sound can be perceived. If helium gas exits the tank directly from the upper opening, first screw the nut encircling the transfer line hand-tight and then fix it with a spanner as soon as the transfer line is fully inserted into the tank.f.  Immerse the lance of the transfer line into ethanol and check for gasflow. Wipe the gas outlet with a tissue and connect the lance to the cryostat of the spectrometer.g.  Close the cryostat with an empty sample rod to prevent condensation of air within the cryostat.h.  Connect the membrane pump to the port on the transfer line. Open the needle valve on the transfer line approximately % turn and switch on the membrane pump to maintain a stream of cold helium gas. Using the gasflow controller of the cryostat, adjust the helium gasflow to ~1 L/h. Switch on the iTC503S temperature controller and set the target temperature to 50K. Cooling down the cryostat from ambient temperatures to 50K usually takes 20-30 min (Note 5).i.  Take the EPR tube out of the liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel and quickly wipe it with a tissue to remove potential contaminants and ice. However, make sure not to keep the EPR tube outside the liquid nitrogen for too long to prevent the sample from warming up. If liquid nitrogen has condensed within the tube, warming up the tube might lead to ejection of the sample or even rupture of the tube.j.  Insert the EPR tube into a tightly fitting sample holder and adjust its position such that the sample will be located in the EPR-active zone of the resonator. For the ER5106-QT2 resonator, the center of the sample should be 38m m below the lower end of the tube holder.k.  Screw the sample holder, with the EPR tube inserted, into a sample rod.l.  Ensure that the spectrometer is in the Standby mode. Stop the membrane pump, wait until the needle of the gasflow controller has dropped to zero, and remove the empty sample rod from the cryostat. Quickly, but also carefully and straight, insert the sample rod, with the EPR tube mounted, as far as it will go. Do not leave the cryostat open for a longer period to prevent air condensation (Note 6). Wait at least 20 min before you proceed to the next steps so that the sample is thermally equilibrated.2.  Spectrometer tuning and safety checka.  Familiarize yourself with the basic functions and operation windows of the Xepr-software by means of the spectrometer manual. In particular, look up keywords such as “Pulse Tables,” “PulseSPEL,” “SpecJet,” “FT EPR Parameters,” “FT Bridge,” “Microwave Bridge Tuning Dialog Box,” and “Acquisition Trigger.” If you need further explanations, ask a more experienced EPR colleague for advice. In the following steps, the buttons, input boxes, and menu bars in the Xepr-software that you should use at a particular step are set in quotation marks.b.  Connect the Xepr-software to the spectrometer by selecting “Connect to Spectrometer” in the “Acquisition”-menu and open the “Microwave Bridge Tuning Dialog Box.” Go into the “Tune”-mode and set the “Attenuation” to 10 dB. Set the microwave (MW) frequency to ~33.7 GHz.c.  Over-couple the resonator (Note 7). The ER5106-QT2 resonator has two screws to adjust the cavity length (right screw) and the cavity coupling (left screw). Adjust the cavity length such that the resonator tuning dip becomes visible in the MW Bridge Tuning Dialog Box. Note that there are two tuning dips for the ER5106-QT2 resonator, a “real” dip and a “fake” dip. These can be distinguished as the “fake” dip moves markedly when the coupling screw is rotated, whereas the “real” dip stays in place. Changing the cavity length moves both dips# simultaneously.Adjust the cavity coupling and the cavity length such that the “real” dip is centered in the Tuning Dialog Box and that the minimum of the “fake” dip is on the right side of the window.d.  Perform the safety check of the spectrometer’s detection system as described in the instrument manual. Attention: Do not attempt to switch the TWT into the Operate mode, if the defense pulses are absent, as this would damage the detection circuitry. In case of doubt, consult your spectrometer administrator.3.  Optimize a standing Hahn echo (Weber, 2005)a.  Adjust the “Center Field” B_0 to the value corresponding to g 2.00 at the current MW frequency ν (e.g., B_011,980G at v33.7G H z) .b.  In the Pulse Tables, program the Hahn echo sequence (π/2––π––Echo) into the ^+x^ -channel using pulse lengths of 12 ns and 24 ns for pi/2 and π-pulses, respectively. Use tau=200 ns for the interpulse delay. After entering pulse lengths and delays into the Pulse Tables, confirm each entry by pressing “Enter” on the keyboard.c.  Select the “Acquisition Trigger”-channel from the dropdown menu and set the acquisition trigger “Length” to 4 ns at the “Position” 0 ns. Set the “Integrator Time Base” to 1.0 ns, the “Shot Rep. Time” to 3,000~us , and the number of “Shots Per Point” to 10.d.  Click “Start” in the Patterns window, “Run” in SpecJet, and decrease the MW “Attenuation” to observe the Hahn echo in SpecJet. Adjust the “Attenuation” to maximize the Hahn echo amplitude i.e., to obtain pi/2 and pi -pulses at the given pulse lengths (Note 8).e.  Set the “No. of Averages” in SpecJet to 1. Set the “Video Bandwidth” to 20 MHz and adjust the “Video Gain” amplification such that the echo is not clipped. Fine-adjust the MW phase such that the echo is fully detected in the real channel of the quadrature detector (green trace in SpecJet); the signal in the imaginary channel (yellow trace in SpecJet) should be zero on average. Slight changes in the “Center Field” may be helpful in this context to fully bring the sample on resonance.4.  Record the echo-detected field-swept EPR spectrum a.  Adjust the acquisition trigger “Position” in the Pulse Tables in such a way that the echo starts at the left of the SpecJet window and increase the acquisition trigger “Length” to ~120 ns, in order to cover the whole echo (Figure 4A). This maximizes the spectral resolution of the field-swept spectrum (Figure 4B).()Figure 4. Initial steps for setting up pulsed EPR experiments. A. Hahn echo. B. Echodetected field-swept EPR spectrum. The grey area in (A) marks the integration region to obtain the field-swept spectrum.b.  In the “Field”-tab within the FT EPR Parameters window, set the “Sweep Width” to 400G .c.  Switch to the “Acquisition”-tab to set the “X-Axis Size”, i.e., the number of points in the spectrum. Usually, 800 is an appropriate value, corresponding to a resolution of 0.5G/p o i n t .d.  Press the “Run” button in the main window to record the spectrum (Figure 4B). Depending on the spin concentration, average multiple scans to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and save the data to disk.e.  Read off the magnetic field value that yields the maximum signal intensity in the field-swept spectrum and write it down, you will need it later.5.  Perform the Two-Pulse Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (Two-Pulse ESEEM) experiment to obtain information on transverse electron spin relaxation, which limits the dipolar evolution window in the PELDOR experiment. In the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment, the Hahn echo amplitude is monitored as a function of the interpulse delay . The default PulseSPEL program provided by Bruker records it as a function of . Note, however, that some literature references show these Hahn echo decay curves as a function of _2tau .a.  Set the “Center Field” to the magnetic field value of the signal maximum in the field-swept spectrum.b.  In the “Acquisition”-tab, open “PulseSPEL” by clicking the corresponding button.c.  Load the standard PulseSPEL program for the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment, which is by default located in the folder: “xeprFiles/PulseSPEL/sharedPulseSPEL/Standard/Spel2009/ESEEM”, and the corresponding variable definitions “descrESEEM.def”.d.  Set the variables to the values shown in Table 1.Table 1. Parameters for the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment()e.  Click the buttons “Compile,” “Show Program,” and “Validate” in this order.f.  In the “Acquisition”-toolbar, choose the option “Run from PulseSPEL,” select the experiment “2P ESE Setup,” and press the “Run”-button in the main program window. Read off the time value at which the echo amplitude is maximal and set this value as the acquisition trigger delay parameter d0. Usually, this value amounts to d0=432 ns.g.  Select the “2P ESEEM” experiment with a two-step phase cycle, set the number of points for this experiment (parameter dim2 in the PulseSPEL program) to 1,024, and click the “Run” button in the main window to record the Hahn echo decay curve (Figure 5B).()Figure 5. The Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment. A. Schematic representation of the Hahnecho sequence. In the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment, the interpulse delay tau is incremented and the echo amplitude is measured as a function of tau . B. Typical Hahn echo decay curve. The inset shows the initial 1.5 µs of the trace, the maximum at 232 ns is highlighted by a red line.h.  If the curve does not reach the zero level at long interpulse delays tau , increase the number of points and/or the time step d30. Read off the time value at which the echo intensity has dropped to almost zero and write it down.6.  Setting up the PELDOR experimentPELDOR is a double-frequency experiment that uses the probe frequency νprobe to create a signal on a spin A in a molecule and flips a spin B in the same molecule with the pump frequency νpump. The four-pulse PELDOR sequence is shown in Figure 6. Firstly, a Hahn echo (HE) is created by a pi/2 and a π-pulse applied at νprobe and affecting spin A. Next, a pump pulse πpump at the frequency νpump inverts spin B. Finally, a refocusing π-pulse at νprobe is applied, refocusing the Hahn echo from spin A. In the PELDOR experiment, the position of the pump pulse is incremented within the interval tau_C2 and the integrated intensity of the refocused echo (RE) is measured as a function of the delay T. This yields the so-called PELDOR time trace. If intramolecular dipolar coupling between spins A and B occurs, the coupling frequency will be encoded in the oscillations of the time trace. The overall exponential decay refers to the intermolecular dipolar interactions.()Figure 6. Schematic representation of the PELDOR sequence. Microwave pulses at the probe frequency are shown in black, the pump pulse is displayed in red. “HE” abbreviates the Hahn echo, “RE” the refocused echo. In the PELDOR experiment, the position of the pump pulse is incremented within the first interval 2 and the integrated intensity of the RE is measured as a function of T.The set-up of the PELDOR experiment consists of various steps, and as PELDOR requires phase cycling and nuclear modulation averaging, it is commonly run from a PulseSPEL program. The Bruker EPR spectrometers are by default equipped with a PulseSPEL program for PELDOR; however, many research groups have developed their own programs featuring custom variable definitions and conventions. Herein, we describe how to set up the PELDOR experiment with our version of the PulseSPEL program, which is available in the Appendix.a.  Set the variables for the Hahn echo and optimize it at the pump frequency, which is applied in the center of the resonator dip (33.7G H z) .i.  Load the PELDOR program and the variable definition file into PulseSPEL. ii.  Set the following parameters in PulseSPEL (Table 2):Table 2. Parameters for setting up the PELDOR experiment. The given parameters are starting values that will be optimized during the course of experimental setup()Note that the PELDOR experiment is tolerant toward variation of these parameters within certain ranges. However, setting completely improper parameters will result in a poor SNR, a low modulation depth, and data distortion.iii.  Click “Compile,” “Show Program,” and “Validate” in this order.iv.  Select the “2P ESE Setup” experiment. Press the “Run” button in the main window, click “Start” in SpecJet and in the Pulse Tables, and lower the “Attenuation” to 0 dB.v.  Open the “MPFU control”-tab. Drag the ^infty<+x> Amplitude” slider bar to a level of 60. 70% to maximize the Hahn echo amplitude in SpecJet.vi.  Adjust the global MW phase using the “Signal Phase” slider bar in the FT bridge window. The MW phase should be adjusted such that the signal appears in the real channel of SpecJet and the imaginary channel should be zero on average.Apply the pump pulse to invert the echo and determine the optimal pump pulse length.i.  Click “Stop” in the Pulse Tables and in SpecJet.ii.  Select the “3P ELDOR Setup” experiment, set the “Current ELDOR Frequency” to the current spectrometer frequency (33.7 G H z) , and press the “Run”-button in the main window. Write down the “Current ELDOR Frequency” for later use.iii.  Read off the time at which the maximum of the echo occurs in the viewport (Figure 7A, e.g., 72 ns), add it to d0, and set the new value of d0 (e.g., 432 ns) in PulseSPEL. Press “Run” in the main window; the echo should now be maximal at the zero-time on the abscissa in the view port (Figure 7B).iv.  Start SpecJet. Decrease the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 0 dB, which should invert the Hahn echo (Note 9a-d).v. Click “Stop” in SpecJet and in the Pulse Tables window. Select the “3P ELDOR Nutation” experiment and press “Run” in the main window; this experiment increments the pump pulse length and measures the amplitude of the Hahn echo. Read off the pump pulse length that leads to the global minimum of the nutation trace and set this value as the parameter p2. Typically, and depending on the sample, optimal pump pulse lengths between 12 ns and 18 ns are obtained (Note 9e).vi.  Set the “Attenuation” to 60 dB, the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 30 dB, and switch the TWT amplifier into the Standby mode. Set the MW Bridge into the “CW”-mode.()Figure 7. Adjustment of the echo position on the time axis by changing the PulseSPEL variable d0. A. d0=360 ns, the echo maximum is located at 72 ns. B. d0=432 ns, the echo maximum coincides with the origin of the abscissa.c.  Change the MW frequency and optimize the Hahn echo at the probe frequency.i. Open the “MW Bridge Tuning Dialog Box” and change the spectrometer frequency by the desired offset (e.g., -80 MHz with respect to the pump frequency) using the “Frequency Slider.”ii. Perform the safety check as described in the instrument manual and switch the TWT into the Operate mode.iii.  Select the “2P ESE Setup” experiment, the phase cycle option ^<+ x> none”, and press “Run” in the main window.iv.  Click “Start” in the Pulse Tables window, “Run” in SpecJet, and decrease the “Attenuation” to 0 dB in steps of 10 dB.v.  Drag the ^<+ x> Amplitude” slider bar in the MPFU control window to maximize the echo amplitude. Adjust the ^<+ x> Phase” such that the signal has a negative sign in the real channel. The imaginary channel should be zero on average.vi.  Select the ^*<-x> none” phase cycle option and again click “Run” in the main window. Adjust the <-nabla×> Amplitude” slider bar to maximize the Hahn echo. Drag the <-nabla×> Phase” slider such that the signal has a positive sign in the real channel. The imaginary part of the signal should be zero on average.vii. Make sure that the absolute echo amplitudes obtained with the phase cycle options “< +×> none” and ^*<-nabla×> none” are equal.d.  Choose the length of the dipolar evolution window 2.i. The length of the interval 2, i.e., the length of the PELDOR time trace, is governed by two aspects, namely transverse electron spin relaxation and the inter-spin distance to be resolved. Transverse electron spin relaxation dictates the maximum of the dipolar evolution window, this can be read off the Hahn echo decay curve recorded in Step B5. The minimal length of 2 is given by the need to resolve at least 1.5 dipolar oscillations encoding the most probable distance in the sample for reliable data analysis.ii.  If you have prior knowledge of the expected inter-spin distance (e.g., from in silico spin labeling), compute the expected oscillation period and set tau_C2 accordingly to resolve at least 1.5 oscillations in the time trace.iii.  If there is no information available on the expected distance, choose a value for tau_C2 according to the Hahn echo decay curve. Set 2 to a value at which sufficient signal intensity is still left in the Two-Pulse ESEEM-trace. If you later realize that a longer dipolar evolution time window is needed to resolve 1.5 oscillations, abort the PELDOR run, increase 2, and re-start the measurement. Note that artefacts may occur at the end of the time trace, which have to be cut off later (see section on Data analysis). Take this into account and hence increase 2 sufficiently.iv.  Set the chosen value for tau_2 in PulseSPEL and activate it by clicking “Compile,” “Show Program,” and “Validate.” Depending on the length of the time trace, consider increasing or decreasing the time increment d30. Find a trade-off between a sufficiently high resolution of the dipolar oscillations and acceptable measurement times (Note 10).e.  Optimize the refocused Hahn echo.i.  Set the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 0 dB.ii.  Select the “4P DEER Setup” program with the phase cycle option “2-step”. Click “Run” in the main window, “Start” in the Pulse Tables window, and “Run” in SpecJet.iii.  Set the “No. of Averages” in SpecJet to 1.iv.  Increase the “Video Gain” amplification such that the echo fills the whole display of SpecJet without clipping at the top or bottom edge.v.  In SpecJet, set the “No. of Averages” to a higher value (100-1,000) such that the echo can be recognized clearly. Depending on the number of transient averages to accumulate, this may take a while.vi.  Press “Run” in the main window to transfer the echo from SpecJet into the viewport. Read off the time position at which the echo is maximal.vii. Set the integration gate width (parameter pg in PulseSPEL) to the length of the longest pulse in the PELDOR sequence, most likely the π-pulse at the probe frequency.viii. Adjust the acquisition trigger offset d0 such that the echo maximum is located at the center of the integration gate. Example: Assume that the refocused echo, recorded with d0=360 ns, peaks at 72 ns (Figure 8A). The integration gate length should be 24 ns starting at the zero-point of the time axis (grey rectangle in Figure 8B). Thus, in order to transfer the echo maximum to the position of 12 ns, set the acquisition delay d0=360 n s+(72-12) ns = 420 ns.()Figure 8. Adjustment of the echo position by changing the PulseSPEL variable d0. A. d0 =360 ns, the echo maximum is located at 72 ns. B. d0=420 ns, the echo peaks at 12 ns. The grey rectangle indicates the integration gate width of 24 ns for the PELDOR experiment.ix.  Click “Run” in the main window and check proper positioning of the echo. f.  Run the PELDOR experiment. i.  Calculate the number of points to be recorded on the PELDOR time trace and set it as the parameter dim5 in the PulseSPEL program. It is given by: dim5=fracd1+d2-2d3d30 with the interpulse delays d1 and d2 of the PELDOR sequence ( tau_1 and tau_2 in Figure 6), the dead-time delay of the spectrometer d3, and the time increment d30. ii.  Select the ^°4P DEER” experiment and the 2-step phase cycle from the dropdown menu and click “Run” in the main window. Click the “Re/Im”-button in the main window toolbar to display the imaginary channel and make sure that it is flat and around the zero level. Change the MW phase accordingly, if there is an appreciable amount of signal in the imaginary channel.iii.  Set a sufficiently high number of scans (50-1,500) to achieve a good SNR. The SNR can be defined as the modulation depth divided by the standard deviation of the noise and should amount to at least 20 or better 100 to permit reliable data analysis. Determination of the SNR can be achieved using e.g., the program SnrCalculator. Depending on the spin concentration, the length of the time trace, and the chosen frequency offset, acquisition times between 4 h and 48~h are usual (Note 10).iv.  As the measurement has finished, save the data on disk in the standard Bruker BES3Tformat (.DTA / .DSC-files).A summary of all key steps described above is shown in Figure 9.()Figure 9. Synopsis of the key steps for setting up a PELDOR experiment. A. Transient nutation experiment. The optimal pump pulse length that leads to a maximal inversion of the echo is given at the global minimum of the trace and marked by a red line. B. Refocused Hahn echo. The integration gate has a length of 24 ns and is indicated by the grey shaded area. C. Raw PELDOR time trace as obtained from the spectrometer prior to data processing.7.  Switch the TWT into the Standby mode. Set the “Attenuation” to 60 dB and the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 30 dB. Switch the microwave bridge into the “CW”-mode and then to “Standby”.8.  If the RNA strand and the spin label are rigid, as is the case here and in Wuebben et al., 2020, orientation selection can occur, i.e., not all orientations of the inter-spin vector with respect to the external magnetic field are sampled in one pair of pump and probe frequency. Orientation selection manifests itself in the PELDOR time traces by the dipolar oscillations becoming dependent on the microwave frequency offset Δν. Moreover, the Fourier-transform of the time traces no longer displays the whole Pake pattern.Regarding data acquisition, two approaches exist to cope with orientation selection. Firstly, the PELDOR experiment can be performed at the frequency offset with minimal orientation selection; in our hands, this is achieved by applying the pump pulse at the maximum of the nitroxide spectrum and the probe pulses at an offset of -80 MHz with respect to νpump.Secondly, PELDOR measurements can be performed at different combinations of νpump and Copyright copyright 2021 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC. 22 νprobe. This approach also offers the possibility to take the orientational selectivity explicitly into account during data analysis (see section on Data analysis; Wuebben et al., 2019).If you opt for the latter approach, repeat this protocol from Step B6c, now using another offset between νpump and νprobe (Figure 10). It is recommended to perform orientation-selective measurements on a particular sample directly one after another and not to remove the sample in between. Thus, the tuning and the sample positioning within the resonator will be equal for all offsets and no changes in spectrometer sensitivity will affect the data quality.()Figure 10. Echo-detected field-swept EPR spectrum with the positions of the pump pulse and the probe pulses indicated for different frequency offsets Δν9.  If all measurements on a particular sample have been performed, switch off the membrane pump, wait for the needle of the gasflow controller to drop to zero, and remove the sample rod.10. At this point, one can either perform PELDOR measurements on another sample, or completely switch off the spectrometer as described in the instrument manual.Note: It is good practice to perform the PELDOR experiment on two to three independently prepared samples to ensure data reliability and reproducibility.\n\n# Outline\n\n## RNA Labeling\n## Ordering and Preparation of RNA

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1129","title":"Click Chemistry for Imaging in-situ Protein Palmitoylation during the Asexual Stages of","text":"Click Chemistry for Imaging in-situ Protein Palmitoylation during the Asexual Stages of\n\n# Abstract\n\nPalmitoylation refers to the modification of the cysteine thiols in proteins by fatty acids, most commonly palmitic acid, through thioester bond’ formation. In vivo, palmitoylation of proteins is catalyzed by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs or DHHC-PATs). Palmitoylation has recently emerged as a crucial post-translational modification in malarial parasites. The expression and activity of palmitoyl transferases vary across different developmental stages of the malarial parasite's life cycle. The abundance of palmitoylated proteins at a given stage is a measure of overall PAT activity. The PAT activity can also change in response to external signals or inhibitors. Here, we describe a protocol to \"image' palmitoyl-transferase activity during the asexual stages using Click Chemistry and fluorescence microscopy. This method is based on metabolic labeling of a clickable analog of palmitic acid by parasitic cells, followed by CuAAC (Copper-catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition reaction) Click Chemistry to render palmitoylated proteins fluorescent.  Fluorescence   allows  the  quantitation  of  intracellular palmitoylation in parasite cells across various development stages. Using this method, we observed that intracellular palmitoylation increases as the parasite transitions from ring to schizont stages and appears to be most abundant during the schizont stages in Plasmodium falciparum.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# Consumables\n\n1.

Click Chemistry is a set of simple chemical reactions driven by a high thermodynamic driving force, which proceed to completion at room temperature, usually without the formation of side products. The CuAAC reaction combines an alkyne-tagged molecule with an azide-tagged molecule in the presence of copper (l) to give rise to a 1- 4 cycloaddition product via a 3+2 cycloaddition reaction. CuAAC is a bio-orthogonal reaction, which implies no effect of other chemical reactions or metabolites within cells. 17-ODA acts as a mimic of endogenous palmitic acid, but it is 'clickable' unlike natural fatty acids (capable of undergoing a click reaction) due to the presence of a terminal alkyne moiety.()CuAAC Click-reaction (Copper catalysed Alkyne Azide cycloaddition reaction)Figure 1. CuAAC click reaction between the fluorescent reporter Oregon Green 488 Azide and 17-0ctadecynoic Acid Alkyne (17-ODA). The reaction occurs between the azide and alkyne moieties to give a 1-4 cycloaddition reaction.DHHC-PATs cannot discriminate between alkyne fatty acids and natural endogenous fatty acids. Hence, they label the intracellular palmitoyl proteins when mimics such as 17-ODA are supplied exogenously in the growth medium (Hannoush and Arenas-Ramirez, 2009; Gao and Hannoush, 2014; Siddiqui et al., 2020).A. Parasite culture and metabolic labeling1.  The 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum is cultured as per the modified method of Trager and Jensen's method (Trager and Jensen, 1976; Radfar et al., 2009). The culture is started with a synchronized early ring-stage frozen glycerol stock with at least a 10% parasitemia (Parasitemia refers to the number of infected/parasitized red blood cells per 100 red blood cells). The 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum is cultured on O+ human red blood cells (Packed red blood cells obtained from healthy blood donors) in complete RPMI medium (see Recipes), since the malarial parasites grow inside red blood cells. The culture is maintained below 5% parasitemia and 1.2% hematocrit (Hematocrit value is the percentage of red blood cells (v/v) in the culture medium) by splitting the culture and reducing parasitemia when required. The hematocrit is maintained at 1.2% by adding fresh red blood cells to the culture. The parasite is cultured under 5% carbon dioxide or a gas mixture composed of 96% nitrogen, 3% carbon dioxide, and 1% oxygen. The amount of culture required for this experiment is small, and a 150-mm cell culture dish has enough material to obtain parasites for metabolic labeling and Click Chemistry.2. The parasite culture is synchronized by sorbitol treatment, which brings about osmotic lysis of the trophozoite and schizont stages of the parasite but spares the early ring stages. The culture suspension is centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 m i n in an Eppendorf 5180R centrifuge using a swing-bucket rotor. The pellet is treated with a 5% solution of sorbitol in water, usually in 5-10- fold excess of the culture pellet volume, and gently resuspended in sorbitol solution and allowed to incubate for 10-15 min at room temperature. This suspension is centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant is discarded until a clear solution is obtained.3. It is good practice to label distinct homogenous stages of intra-erythrocytic development of the parasite with a clickable fatty acid probe (17-ODA) using sorbitol-synchronized parasite cultures. Sorbitol treatment of a mixed culture eliminates the late trophozoite and schizont stages but spares the ring stages, ensuring a homogenous population of parasites (see Figure 2a-2c). Note: Sorbitol treatment is most effective when the culture contains a mixed population of rings, trophozoites, and schizonts. See Recipes to make the sorbitol solution.4. Giemsa staining of parasite smears allows judgment of the state of synchronization for the parasite culture before and after sorbitol treatment. For labeling, parasites are maintained at a parasitemia of 5% and a hematocrit value of 1% . Parasites at the ring, trophozoite, or schizont stage (42-44 h post-invasion or h.p.i) are incubated in a 6-well plate in complete RPMl medium supplemented with 17-ODA, a clickable surrogate of palmitic acid. The optimal 17-ODA concentration requires optimization. We found 100~uM to be the optimal concentration of 17- ODA that yielded the best labeling of intra-erythrocytic malarial parasites.Note: Usually, a concentration of 25-50 μM is sufficient for other cell types, but the asexual stages of malarial parasites develop inside red blood cells and may therefore require a higher concentration of 17-ODA in the culture medium for efficient labeling.5. The ring/trophozoite/schizont cultures are allowed to incubate at 37C for 8-10~h incomplete RMPI medium supplemented with 17-ODA, which allows metabolic labeling of cellular palmitoylproteins with 17-ODA. After incubation, the culture medium and parasitized red blood cells are aspirated from 6-well plate wells, transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge for 10 min (see Figure 2e). Note: It is advisable to reserve a well for parasite cells incubated in culture medium lacking 17- ODA. The smears prepared from this well can serve as a control for the specificity of the click reaction.B. Smear preparation and sample fixation1. The infected and uninfected red blood cells are visible at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube as a loose pellet (at 1% hematocrit, the total pellet volume is 1~ml packed red blood cells containing 5% infected cells if the parasitemia is 5% in 100ml culture; 20~u in 2 m ).The supernatant is aspirated using a pipette and discarded, and the pellet is washed twice with DPBS (Dulbecco's Modified PBS). The culture pellet is gently resuspended in RPMI (1:1 v/v; pellet: RPMI); 10-20ul suspension is used to make smears (see Figure 2e). Note: Smears should also be made from uninfected red blood cells incubated in 17-ODAsupplemented medium to observe the background signal due to fluorescence.2.  Preparing thin smears ensures an even distribution of cells. The slides are marked accordingly to indicate the sample, and allowed to air dry inside a laminar flow biosafety hood for 20-30 min. Over-drying of smears is not recommended and once dried, smears are fixed using chilled methanol in a Coplin jar for 10-15 min. The slides are removed after 15 min and air-dried again.3. The smears are placed into small Petri dishes and washed three times with × PBS while shaking gently. The smears are washed again with 0.1% Triton X-100 inPBS for permeabilization. The permeabilized, fixed smears are now ready for Click Chemistry to be performed.C. In-situ Click Chemistry in malarial parasite cellsI. The Click reaction with Oregon Green 488 Azide proceeds in the dark at room temperature. Metabolic labeling with 17-ODA labels the parasite proteins with 17-ODA due to DHHC-PAT activity (Siddiqui et al., 2020). The CuAAC click reaction causes chemo-selective ligation between chemically complementary azide and alkyne functions, since the fatty acid probe (17- ODA) is thio-esterified to palmitoyl proteins (Figure 2f, reaction is shown in the box) and alkyne function is available to undergo a click reaction. A click reaction combines the fluorescent reporter Oregon Green 488 Azide with the alkyne function of 17-ODA and renders 17-ODAlabeled palmitoyl proteins fluorescent (Figure 2f).2. The click reaction cocktail is prepared as follows. For 100ul reaction cocktail, add the following components sequentially to 94~ul filtered PBS: 2~ul Oregon Green 488 Azide (Invitrogen, final concentration of 0.1m M 2 ul 0.1 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) solution, and 2 ll 0.1 lm M C u S O4 solution. The click reaction cocktail should cover the entire surface of the smear.()Figure 2. Layout of the protocol. (a). Asexual stages of the parasite are allowed to grow on human blood in complete RPMl medium. (b). Parasite cultures are subjected to centrifugation. (c). Parasite culture pellets are treated with sorbitol to synchronize cultures. (d). Synchronizedcultures are allowed to grow in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 17-ODA. (e). Cultures are centrifuged gently to obtain a loose pellet, which is then resuspended to make smears. (f). Smears are processed and Click Chemistry is performed (the box in blue shows the click reaction between 17-ODA-labeled parasite proteins and Oregon Green 488 Azide). (g). Confocal imaging of smears for each parasite stage is performed and raw data are acquired. (h). The raw data are processed and analyzed to quantitate the fluorescence in different asexual stages of the parasite.Notes:a.This image was created using BioRender.b. The sequence in which reagents for the click reaction are added is crucial and should be adhered to during the reaction. Always prepare fresh TCEP and CuSO4for each experiment anduseimmediately.3. Each slide is placed in a small Petri dish for incubation, with two small pieces of tissue paper or cotton soaked in water placed alongside to retain moisture and prevent drying of the smears during the incubation period.4. Oregon Green 488 Azide is fluorescent and should be protected from light; therefore, the reaction is allowed to proceed for 40m i n in the dark at room temperature.5. After incubation, each slide is washed with 10-15 ml filtered PBS in a Petri dish with gentle rotation. This is performed two or three times to remove any ingredients of the click reaction that are non-specifically bound to the smear/slide surface. In particular, non-specific binding of Oregon Green 488 Azide to the smear or slide surface may lead to a high background fluorescence and must be removed by gentle and repeated washing.D. The excess liquid on the slide surface should be aspirated using a pipette, and the remaining moisture should be wiped with Kimwipes TM without touching or abrading the smear.E. Slide mounting and fixation1. Wear powder-free gloves when touching the coverslips or slides from this stage onward. The slides are mounted with DAPI ProLong TM Gold Antifade Mountant; 20-30~uI is poured on the smear and a coverslip gently placed on top, which should be pressed gently on the smear to avoid the formation of air bubbles. Note: It is advisable to use tweezers to hold the coverslips. Coverslips should be immersed in 70% ethanol overnight to render them sterile and dirt-free. Coverslips tend to stick together; make sure only one coverslip is picked up.2. The excess mountant is gently wiped off the slide using KimwipesTM, and the edges of the coverslips are sealed to the slide surface using nail polish. The nail polish is allowed to dry and slides are then stored in the dark at 4C until image acquisition.Note: It is recommended that the image acquisition be performed within a day or two to obtain thebest results.F. Data acquisition and analysis1. Any confocal microscope can be used for capture and acquisition of fluorescence.2. The raw data are processed using the NiS image analysis software. Since the fluorescence due to Oregon Green 488 Azide corresponds to palmitoylated proteins, fluorescence is a direct measure of palmitoyl-transferase activity at a given stage.3. It is recommended to score a minimum of 10-20 parasite cells corresponding to each stage (rings, trophozoite, and schizont) for each experimental replicate. Data from three experimental replicates are required to obtain a mean fluorescence value with standard deviation and statistical significance.4. Fluorescence intensity for each cellis determined by drawing an ROl (Region of Interest) around each fluorescent cell using the NIS image analysis software toolbox and measuring the fluorescence intensity. Such an analysis is also possible using the open source software, ImageJ or Fiji. Note: It is essential to use the same ROl to measure the fluorescence intensity for each cell from a replicate.5. Fluorescence intensities for cells from a given stage are required to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity and standard deviation. However, it is important to note that each cell's fluorescence intensity should be corrected by subtracting the average background fluorescence intensity.6. For this purpose, an average background fluorescence intensity is calculated by measuring the fluorescence intensities of uninfected red blood cells (labeled with 17-ODA).7. Corrected fluorescence intensity is determined by subtracting the average background from the fluorescence intensity of each cell. Note: The average background fluorescence intensity may vary among experiments and replicates; therefore, it is recommended to use the background fluorescence value for a given sample/slide to calculate the corrected fluorescence values for cells on the same slide/smear.8. We calculated the average fluorescence intensity across the various asexual stages of the parasite and found that palmitoylation increases as the parasite transitions from the ring to the schizont stage (see Figure 3). The highest fluorescence is observed for the schizont stages of Plasmodium falciparum, which suggests that PAT activity is highest during this stage (Figure 3A).()Figure 3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1134","title":"Screening for Lysogen Activity in Therapeutically Relevant Bacteriophages","text":"Screening for Lysogen Activity in Therapeutically Relevant Bacteriophages\n\n# Abstract\n\nLysogenic phages can integrate into their bacterial host’s genome, potentially transferring any genetic information they possess including virulence or resistance genes, and are therefore routinely excluded from therapeutic applications. Lysogenic behavior is typically seen in phages that create turbid plaques or possess subpar bactericidal activity; yet, these are not definitive indicators. As a result, the presence of integrase genes is often used as a hallmark for lysogenic behavior; however, the accuracy of genetic screening for lysogeny depends on the quality of the extraction, sequencing and assembly of the phage genome, and database comparison. The present protocol describes a simple phenotypic test that can be used to screen therapeutically relevant phages for lysogenic behavior. This test relies on the identification of spontaneous phage release from their lysogenized host and can be reliably used in cases where no sequencing data are available. The protocol does not require specialized equipment, is not work-intensive, and is broadly applicable to any phage with an easily culturable bacterial host, making it particularly amenable to settings with limited resources.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  15-ml polystyrene tubes (In Vitro Technologies, Falcon, catalog number: FAL352095)\n2.

Coincubation of phages and bacterial hosts (spot assay)Note: The estimated time to complete this section is 45 min of benchwork followed by overnightincubation.1.  In a sterile glass test tube, mix 1 ml bacterial culture with 3ml molten top agar. Note: The top agar can be liquified using a microwave. Be careful: too hot a temperature of the top agar will kill the bacterial population, resulting in a poor lawn. The top agar should be liquid but pleasantly warm to the touch (approximately 5O^°C) .2.  Pour the mixture onto a room-temperature LB agar plate and allow to solidify.3.  Prepare two or three serial dilutions (1 m) of the high-titer phage lysate in PBS. Note: We recommend using at least two concentrations of phage, for example 10^8 and 10^6 PFU/ml.4.  Spot 10-ul drops of each phage lysate dilution onto the surface of the prepared plate. Note: Spots of further dilutions or replicates of the same dilutions can be added to the same plate.5.  Leave the plate, lid partially on, close to a Bunsen burner until the spots are completely dry; this can take up to 30min . Alternatively, the plates can be left to dry in a biosafety hood.6.  Incubate at 37^°C for up to 4 days, with daily checks to assess the formation of “mesas” (Figure 1A) (Pope et al., 2013). Note: Mesas are zones of confluent bacterial growth in the center of the lysis spots. Bacteria growing on mesas have become resistant to the phage, possibly (but not exclusively) due to homoimmunity. While checking for mesas, also look for agar dehydration due to prolonged incubation, which could hamper bacterial viability. Desiccation can be further avoided by incubating the plates in a sealed container with a wet paper towel, creating a humid chamber.7.  Using a sterile wire loop, scrape one loopful of bacterial growth from a mesa and use it as the primary inoculum for a streak plate on fresh LB agar (see Graphical abstract). Repeat for each mesa.8.  Incubate at 37^°C overnight. Assess the growth of clearly isolated colonies. Note: Any of these colonies could contain the integrated prophage. We routinely test 10 colonies obtained from each of at least two mesas, for a total of at least 20 colonies.# B.  Patch plate screenNote: The estimated time to complete this section is 30 min of benchwork and multiple overnight incubations.1.  Label and divide two LB agar plates into a grid with as many sections as colonies to be screened. Number the sections on both plates identically from 1 to 20. Note: A single plate can comfortably fit 20 colonies.2.  Prepare one of the plates with a lawn of bacterial host following Steps A1 and A2. The other plate is used without further preparation.3.  Using a sterile wire loop, a disposable pipette tip, or a sterile toothpick, take a random colony from the streak plate (prepared in Step A7), gently patch it onto section 1 of the LB plate, and then onto its corresponding section of the LB plate with the bacterial host lawn (Step B2). Note: Avoid tearing the delicate agar while performing the patches.4.  Repeat Step B3 with as many colonies as needed.5.  Incubate the plates at 37^°C for up to 2 days, with daily checks for interpretation.6.  To interpret the test, look closely at the plate with the host lawn. Positive colonies, those potentially harboring the prophage, will present signs of lysis (plaques, halos, loss of turbidity) on the lawn around them, which is caused by the spontaneous release of the phage (Figure 1B). Note: If all the screened colonies are negative for the patch test, it can be concluded that the phage is unable to lysogenize the host (see Table 1). False positive results here are possible due to carry-over of phage particles from the mesa onto the streak plate (Step A7).7.  For each positive colony, return to the LB plate without the host lawn (prepared in Steps B3-B4), pick a section of the patch with a wire loop, and streak onto a fresh LB plate.8.  Incubate overnight at 37^°C .9.  Pick a single colony with a wire loop and re-streak onto a fresh LB plate.10. Incubate overnight at 37^°C . Note: You have now performed a double single-colony purification. Using colonies from this plate (B9), repeat Procedure B (Figure 1C) and perform tests C and D to confirm lysogenic behavior.C.  Spontaneous phage release in liquid culture test (Supernatant assay)Note: The estimated time to complete this section is 45 min of benchwork followed by overnight incubation.1.  Following purification of the colony of interest with two consecutive streak plates, inoculate the colony into a 10ml Falcon tube containing 4~ml LB.2.  Incubate overnight at 37^°C with aeration. Note: Aeration, achieved by leaving enough head space in the tube and incubating on a shaking platform at 150 rpm, is needed for optimal growth of the host used in this example. Growth conditions can be modified to cater to different hosts.3.  Centrifuge the culture at ^3,500× g for 10m i n .4.  Collect the supernatant using a 10ml syringe.5.  Attach a 0.2–um filter to the syringe and carefully depress the plunger to filter the supernatant into a fresh tube. Note: This step is optional. If not performed, we recommend repeating Steps C3 and C4.6.  Perform a spot assay (Procedure A), replacing the phage lysate with the filtered supernatant from C5.7.  For test interpretation, look for signs of lysis on the spot assay caused by the spontaneous release of phages from the lysogens into the supernatant of the liquid culture (Figure 1D).# D.  Immunity assayNote: The estimated time to complete this section is 15 min of benchwork followed by overnight incubation.1.  Perform a spot assay (Procedure A) replacing the original bacterial host with the candidate lysogen purified in Step B9.2.  For test interpretation, look for the absence of lysis caused by homoimmunity (no clearing, plaques, or loss of turbidity on the bacterial lawn) (Figure 1E). Note: An immunity assay showing resistance to the original phage, without positive findings of lysogeny on Procedures B and C, is suggestive of alternative mechanisms of phage resistance. Conversely, a confirmed lysogen will test positive in Procedures B, C, and D. For an expanded explanation regarding interpretation of the procedures, see Figure 1 and Table 1.()Figure 1. Screening for lysogenic behavior of phage øCO01 (Gordillo Altamirano et al., 2021) on host strain Acinetobacter baumannii A9844 (Peleg et al., 2008) and phage øFGVRE (unpublished) on host strain Enterococcus faecium ST796 (Buultjens et al., 2017). A. Spot assay with droplets of 10^8 and 10^6P F Uml phage lysate after a 48-h incubation. Black stars denote mesas. B. First patch assay using plates with and without lawns of the bacterial hosts. Black arrows (colonies 9, 13, and 15 on A. baumannii and colony 11 on E. faecium) show bacterial growth with surrounding lysis, indicating the presence of phage, possibly released from a lysogen. Zoomed sections are provided as examples of positive and negative colonies. For A. baumannii, the panel only shows half the total screened colonies (18/36). C. Second patch plate, after two rounds of single-colony purification of colonies 9, 13, and 15 (A. baumannii) and colony 11 (E. faecium), without indication of phage presence when patched onto plates containing bacterial host lawns. D. Spot assay performed with the filtered supernatant from cultures of the putative lysogenic colonies, with no indication of spontaneous phage release. E. Immunity assay of colonies 9 and 13 (A. baumannii) and colony 11 (E. faecium) indicates sensitivity to their respective phages, thereby excluding homoimmunity; for colony 15 (A. baumannii), the test demonstrates  resistance  to  the  phage,  most  likely  due  to  a  mechanism  other  than homoimmunity (see Table 1 for interpretation).

After infecting hepatocytes, the virus establishes a stable episome (covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA) that serves as the template for all viral transcripts. Specific and accurate quantification of cccDNA is difficult because infected cells contain abundant replicative intermediates of HBV DNA that share overlapping sequences but arranged in slightly different forms. HBV cccDNA can be detected by Southern blot or qPCR methods which involve enzymatic digestion. These assays are laborious, have limited sensitivity, or require degradation of cellular DNA (which precludes simple normalization). The method described in this protocol, cccDNA inversion quantitative (cinq)PCR, instead uses a series of restriction enzyme-mediated hydrolysis and ligation reactions that convert cccDNA into an inverted linear amplicon, which is not amplified or detected from other forms of HBV DNA. Importantly, cellular DNA remains quantifiable during sample preparation, allowing normalization and markedly improving precision. Further, a second linear fragment (derived from enzymatic digestion of a separate region of the HBV DNA genome and is present in all forms of HBV DNA) can be used to simultaneously quantify total HBV levels.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: All stored at room temperature unless otherwise stated.\n\n1.  24-well cell culture plates (Corning, catalog number: 3527)\n2. 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt, catalog number: 72706)\n3.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1156","title":"Analysis of TORC1-body Formation in Budding Yeast","text":"Analysis of TORC1-body Formation in Budding Yeast\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) is the master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 is active and drives protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating a wide range of proteins. In contrast, when nitrogen and/or glucose levels fall, TORC1 is inhibited, causing the cell to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism, and eventually enter a quiescent state. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC1 inhibition triggers the movement of TORC1 from its position around the vacuole to a single focus/body on the edge of the vacuolar membrane. This relocalization depends on the activity of numerous key TORC1 regulators and thus analysis of TORC1 localization can be used to follow signaling through the TORC1 pathway. Here we provide a detailed protocol for measuring TORC1 (specifically, Kog1-YFP) relocalization/signaling using fluorescence microscopy. Emphasis is placed on procedures that ensure: (1) TORC1-bodies are identified (and counted) correctly despite their relatively low fluorescence and the accumulation of autofluorescent foci during glucose and nitrogen starvation; (2) Cells are kept in log-phase growth at the start of each experiment so that the dynamics of TORC1-body formation are monitored correctly; (3) The appropriate fluorescent tags are used to avoid examining mislocalized TORC1.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  8-well micro-slide (Ibidi, catalog number: 80826)\n2.

(2015) and Sullivan et al. (2019). We generally follow movement of TORC1 on the vacuolar membrane in a standard W303 lab strain (trp1-1;can1-100;leu2-3,112;his3-11,15;ura3;GAL+;ADE+) carrying Kog1 with a yellow fluorescent protein tag at its native locus (Kog1-ECitrine, or Kog1-YFP for short). Tags on other TORC1 subunits (particularly Tco89) can also be used, but Kog1-YFP gives the strongest signal. It is worth noting fluorescent tags on Tor1 disrupt TORC1 localization and activity.1.  Prepare an 8-well glass-bottom chamber slide by adding 200~ul of 2 m/m Concanavalin A (ConA) solution to each well (ensuring the bottom of each slide is completely coated). Incubate the slide for 10 min at 25~^°C_: , and then remove the solution and allow the wells to air-dry overnight (in the dark) with the lid in place. The ConA treatment ensures that the yeast adheres to the coverslip at the bottom of each chamber, making medium swaps and high-quality imaging possible.2.  Patch out the strains that are going to be examined onto fresh YEPD plates, starting from glycerol stocks (yeast in 15% glycerol and YEPD, stored at -80~^°C_I ) using sterile applicator sticks, and then incubate the plates at 30~^°C overnight (or up to three days).3.  Transfer approximately 5~ul of each strain/patch into a separate ^28ml tube containing 5~m of SD medium (again using sterile applicator sticks).4.  Grow the 5ml starter cultures at 30^°C in a drum rotator (rotating at approximately 40r p m) until they reach mid-log phase ( O D_600 between 0.5 and 0.7) – this usually takes 5h .5.  Transfer approximately 4~m of each starter culture into a separate 150~m Erlenmeyer flask containing ^20ml of SD medium, so that the final O D_600 is 0.1.6.  Grow the ^20m cultures at 30~^°C , shaking at 200 rpm, until they reach an O D_6000.4 .7.  While the cultures grow, heat the microscope chamber, 15~m of fresh SD medium, and 15~m of fresh starvation medium (e.g., S-glucose or S-nitrogen) to 30~^°C .8.  Pipet 300~ul of each culture into the wells of a ConA-treated chamber slide and then allow the cells to settle for 5 min at 30~^°C .9.  Gently aspirate the medium from each well and discard.10. Add 300~ul fresh SD medium at 30~^°C .11. Capture  log-growth  (time  0)  images  in  each  well  using  a 100× objective  and  YFP excitation/emission filter angleambda_E×510/25 ; ambda_E M540/21 ) collecting a stack of sixteen images, eachseparated by 0.4um in the z-plane, with a 200 ms exposure per plane*. In general you need to capture images in 2-3 fields to ensure you have data for enough cells (>00) to get an accurate TORC1-body count. Once the fluorescence imaging is complete, capture a Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) or Brightfield reference image.*Note: The imaging is difficult since there are only ~100 TORC1 molecules per cell. First, you must have a high-quality microscope and a sensitive camera to see Kog1-YFP – particularly when the TORC1 molecules are spread across the vacuole. We currently use a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a Photometrics Prime 95-B camera. Second, you can only image a given field once before significant photobleaching occurs. Third, you must take z-stacks (3D images) that span the entire depth of the cell to identify all of the TORC1 foci since the bodies form on the edge of the vacuole and are thus often at the top or bottom of the cell.12. Remove the chamber slide from the microscope, aspirate and discard medium from each well.13. Wash each well three times with synthetic medium missing glucose (S-glucose), or synthetic medium missing nitrogen (S-nitrogen), at 30^°C , using 350 μl, 400ul , and then 450ul of medium, by gently pipetting against the same corner of each well and then aspirating and discarding each wash except the last (which is left in the well during imaging).14. Start a timer after the first wash and capture z-stacks at each time-point in all wells as described in Step 11 (we typically take pictures every 10 min for 1h ), keeping the slide at 30^°C during the entire experiment.In each experiment, a wild-type (or relevant mutant strain) missing a fluorescent (YFP) tag should also be imaged as a control. We have found that starvation (particularly glucose starvation) can trigger the formation of autofluorescent puncta. The intensity and number of puncta increase over time, and their appearance is highly dependent on the batch of medium being used.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1172","title":"Preparation and Characterization of Poly(2-oxazoline) Micelles for the Solubilization and Delivery of Water Insoluble Drugs","text":"Preparation and Characterization of Poly(2-oxazoline) Micelles for the Solubilization and Delivery of Water Insoluble Drugs\n\n# Abstract\n\nMany new drug development candidates are highly lipophilic compounds with low water solubility. This constitutes a formidable challenge for the use of such compounds for cancer therapy, where high doses and intravenous injections are needed (Di et al., 2012). Here, we present a poly(2- oxazoline) polymer (P O x) -based nanoformulation strategy to solubilize and deliver hydrophobic drugs. POx micelles are prepared by a simple thin-film hydration method. In this method, the drug and polymer are dissolved in a common solvent and allowed to mix, following which the solvent is evaporated using mild heating conditions to form a thin film. The micelles form spontaneously upon hydration with saline. POx nanoformulation of hydrophobic drugs is unique in that it has a high drug loading capacity, which is superior to micelles of conventional surfactants. Moreover, multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can be included within the same POx micelle, thereby enabling the codelivery of binary as well as ternary drug combinations (Han et al., 2012; He et al., 2016).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Preparation of drug-loaded POx micelles (Figure 1, Small, μL scale; applicable to single and multidrug loaded POx micelles)1.  Prepare stock solutions of the drug and polymer in a common solvent.Note: Commonly used solvents for the preparation of POx micelles are ethanol (200 proof), methanol, and acetone. In some cases, a mixture of two solvents is used to dissolve drugs. The concentration of the stock solution is determined by the solubility of the drug/polymer in the solvent. E.g., Prepare Paclitaxel stock solution in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and POx stock solution in the same solvent at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (POx is also soluble in acetone and methanol at  10mg/ml). You will need to use an ultrasonic bath for the dissolution of PTX in ethanol.2.  Mix the polymer and drug solutions at a predetermined polymer/drug ratio (w/w). Note: Polymer:drug weight ratio of 10:2 is a good starting point to determine if the polymer can solubilize the drug. If the thin film disperses well in saline (step 4), work your way up to higher ratios (10:4 and 10:8). E.g., for a 10:4 loading ratio of POx:PTX, add a 50 μl stock solution of POx with a 20 μL stock solution of PTX and mix using a vortex mixer (setting 10; for -10s) .3.  Evaporate the solvent by placing the Eppendorf tube containing the drug-polymer mixture in a heating block and blowing a stream of nitrogen gas into the tube. The appearance of a clear (not cloudy) thin film is indicative of optimal heating conditions (see Figure 2A). The optimum temperature for evaporation is dictated by the physicochemical properties of the solvent (e.g., vaporization temperature) and drug (e.g., Lipophilicity, polarity, etc.) in use. Of note, the optimized temperature of evaporation for Resiquimod and PTX is 50~^°C and 45~^°C , respectively, and for other drugs varies from 40~^°C to 80~^°C .Note: A disposable pipette tip can be inserted into the end of a PVC tubing and lowered into the Eppendorf tube to facilitate a gentle flow of nitrogen. Further, residual traces of solvent can be removed by placing the thin film in the desiccator overnight.()Figure 1. POx micelle preparation workflow (created with BioRender.com)4.  Hydrate the thin film with normal saline.The volume of saline to be used is determined by the desired final drug(s) concentration. The optimal conditions of hydration vary with each drug. For instance, incubation for 10 m i n at RT followed by mild agitation by gently flicking the tube is sufficient for solubilizing thin films of Resiquimod. In comparison, Paclitaxel requires incubation at 65~^°C for 20 min and gentle agitation every 5 min. The temperature of hydration should be optimized empirically for every single and multi-drug incorporated POx micelles.Note: Gentle agitation (using a vortex mixer or gently flicking the tube) is necessary to completely disperse the thin polymer-drug film. Visual inspection is a primary means of telling if the hydration conditions worked. While most drugs solubilize within 10 min, for certain drugs, an additional incubation time can yield better size distribution (Figure 2C) by facilitating specific interactions between the drug and polymer (hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, etc.)5.  Centrifuge the micelle solution at 10,000× g for 2-3 min to separate the unencapsulated drug (pellet) and transfer the supernatant containing the drug-loaded micelles to a new tube.6.  Depending on the stability of the P O x micelle solution of drugs, these can either be stored at 4~^°C for up to a couple of weeks or freeze-dried for long-term storage. The lyophilized formulation of POx micelles can be easily re-dispersed in DI water without loss in drug-loading and activity.B.  Preparation of drug-loaded POx micelles (Figure 1, large, mL scale; applicable to single and multidrug loaded POx micelles)1.  Follow Steps A1 to A2. Use glass vials to accommodate large volumes of stock solutions and a round-bottom (RB) flask for mixing the drug and polymer solutions.2.  Evaporate the solvent using a rotary vacuum evaporator. Adjust the temperature of the water bath as needed.3.  The thin film will form in the bottom half of the RB flask when completed.4.  Hydrate the thin film with saline and immerse it in the water bath at the optimal hydration temperature for the required time – usually 10 to 15 min.5.  The micelle solution can be aliquoted into small volumes and centrifuged as in Step A5.6.  Lyophilize the formulation for long-term storage.C.  Characterization of POx micellesThe primarily used physicochemical characterization techniques for POx micelles include dynamic light scattering (DLS) for the determination of the size distribution and reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography for drug loading.1.  Sample Preparation for DLS measurement a.  Dilute the micelles 10-fold in saline. Note: Typical dilutions used for DLS measurements of POx micelles range from 1:2-1:50, which correspond to drug concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml. b.  Use nylon syringe filters of 0.2 microns to separate large particles. c.  Transfer the filtered solution into a clean cuvette without introducing air bubbles. d.  Place the cuvette in the sample holder and, following equilibration for at least 2 min, take 3separate measurements for every sample.2.  Sample preparation for HPLC measurementa.  Dilute the micelle sample 50-fold in a mixture of 50/50 acetonitrile (ACN): water (v/v).b.  Filter the diluted sample using a 0.2-micron syringe filter and transfer 100~ul into an HPLC autosampler vial.c.  Get rid of any air bubbles from the autosampler vial by gently tapping before placing it in the vial tray.d.  Prepare the standards by serially diluting the analyte at concentrations ranging from 6.25 mu g/m to 200 u/m .e.  The run settings must be optimized for each drug. Note: 60/40 ACN: water, 1 mg/ml flow rate, and 10 μl injection volume is usually a good starting point for most drugs. Spiking the mobile phase solvents with 0.% trifluoroacetic acid helps sharpen the peaks. Make sure the settings used for the sample are identical to the ones used for standards.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Drug-Loaded POx Micelles (Small, μL Scale)\n## Prepare Stock Solutions\nPrepare stock solutions of the drug and polymer in a common solvent.\nNote the commonly used solvents for POx micelles, such as ethanol, methanol, and acetone.\nDetermine the concentration of the stock solution based on the solubility of the drug/polymer in the solvent.\n## Mix Polymer and Drug Solutions\nMix the polymer and drug solutions at a predetermined polymer/drug ratio (w/w).\nStart with a polymer:drug weight ratio of 10:2 to determine if the polymer can solubilize the drug.\nAdjust the ratio as needed, such as 10:4 or 10:8.\n## Evaporate Solvent\nEvaporate the solvent by placing the Eppendorf tube containing the drug-polymer mixture in a heating block.\nBlow a stream of nitrogen gas into the tube to facilitate evaporation.\nOptimize the temperature for evaporation based on the physicochemical properties of the solvent and drug.\n## Hydrate Thin Film\nHydrate the thin film with normal saline.\nDetermine the volume of saline based on the desired final drug concentration.\nOptimize the conditions of hydration, such as temperature and incubation time, for each drug.\n## Centrifuge and Store\nCentrifuge the micelle solution at 10,000×g for 2-3 min to separate the unencapsulated drug.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the drug-loaded micelles to a new tube.\nStore the micelle solution at 4°C for up to a couple of weeks or freeze-dry for long-term storage.\n## Preparation of Drug-Loaded POx Micelles (Large, mL Scale)\n## Follow Steps A1 to A2\nUse glass vials to accommodate large volumes of stock solutions.\nUse a round-bottom flask for mixing the drug and polymer solutions.\n## Evaporate Solvent\nEvaporate the solvent using a rotary vacuum evaporator.\nAdjust the temperature of the water bath as needed.\n## Hydrate Thin Film\nHydrate the thin film with saline.\nImmerse the thin film in a water bath at the optimal hydration temperature.\n## Centrifuge and Store\nAliquot the micelle solution into small volumes.\nCentrifuge the micelle solution as in Step A5.\nLyophilize the formulation for long-term storage.\n## Characterization of POx Micelles\n## Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Measurement\nDilute the micelles 10-fold in saline.\nUse nylon syringe filters to separate large particles.\nTransfer the filtered solution into a clean cuvette.\n## High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Measurement\nDilute the micelle sample 50-fold in a mixture of acetonitrile and water.\nFilter the diluted sample using a 0.2-micron syringe filter.\nTransfer 100 μL into an HPLC autosampler vial.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Pharmacology & Drug Development"}}

All steps involving cell culture must be performed in a laminar flow hood.2.  Seed 3×10^4 HeLa cells in a 6-well plate containing 2-3 small coverslips using 2 ml DMEMcomplete medium per well. Prepare 1 well per time point (see Note 1).3.  Incubate the cells at 37~^°C , 5% C O_2 for 24~h .4.  After 24~h incubation, set up PEI transfection reaction. Per well:a.  200 µl OptiMEMb. 2 µg RUSH construct, e.g., pIRESneo3-SS-Str-KDEL-MMP2-SBP-EGFPc. 15ul~50mM PEI solution5.  Vortex the transfection reaction and incubate it at room temperature for 20 min.6.  Add dropwise to the cells and incubate at ackslash7 ^°,5% O_2 for at least 16~h . Avoid incubation periods longer than 24~h . If they are necessary, change cell medium after 24~h .B.  RUSH experiment1.  After incubation, prepare _2m of DMEM complete with d-biotin to a final concentration of 40uM per well. Prepare enough volume according to the number of wells to analyze (for example, for 4 wells (2 ml medium per well), prepare 9 ml of DMEM complete +7.2ul d-biotin 500m M ). Keep it warm at 37~^°C .2.  Remove medium from cells either by aspiration with a micropipette or with a vacuum pump and wash once with 1× DPBS.3.  Add ^2mI DMEM complete without biotin to all the time points except the latest one (see Note 2). For example, for MMP2 four time points are analyzed (0, 15, 30 and 45~m i n ). Add medium only to the wells labeled as 0, 15 and 30 min.4.  Add 2 ml DMEM complete pmb+ biotin (from Step B1) to the latest time point (for MMP2, to the well labeled as 45 min. Figure 3, “start of the experiment”).5.  Incubate cells at 37~textdegreeC,5%~CO_2 .The incubation time is determined by the trafficking kinetics of each construct and in order to facilitate the experimental handling we recommend to start adding biotin first to the well that needs to be incubated the longest time (45 min for MMP2) and then continue with the earlier time points (30 and 15 min, see scheme in Figure 3).Important: Here is recommended to take the cells out of the incubator at least 2 min before triggering cargo trafficking in the next time point (for MMP2, the plate is taken out of the incubator 13 min after adding biotin to the previous well, namely, 2 min before starting the next time point. See note 2 for a more detailed explanation).()Figure 3. Scheme depicting the handling times during time intervals for the RUSH experiment. The scheme depicts the handling time for an experienced person using the MMP2 construct with the described time points of 0, 15, 30 and 45m i n, .6.  Remove media from the next time point to be analyzed and add ^2m DMEM complete ^+ biotin. 7.  Repeat Steps B2, B4 and B5 until completing the full-time cycle (for MMP2, 45 min with a last biotin addition at 15min before fixation, Figure 3).C.  Coverslip montage1.  Right before incubation ends, wash the cells (all the wells) 2 times with 1× PBS. 2.  Incubate cells for 10 min in 4% PFA in PBS under low light conditions. Make sure that the coverslips are completely covered with the PFA solution.3.  Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.4.  If no co-staining is performed: add a small amount of PBS to the well to facilitate the handling of coverslips and mount them using the ProLong antifade Gold reagent. For this purpose:a.  Take a microscopy glass slide.b.  Put one drop of ProLong antifade Gold reagent on the slide.c.  Take carefully one of the coverslips with tweezers.d.  Place the coverslip facing down on top of the ProLong antifade Gold reagent (i.e., the side of the coverslip with cells must be in contact with the antifade reagent).e.  Carefully store them in a dark place until imaging. It is recommended to allow the montaged slides to dry for at least 24h_i ideally for 48h .5.  If co-staining is performed:a.  Permeabilize the cells with permeabilization solution for 5 min under low light conditions.b.  Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.c.  Incubate with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C under low light conditions.d.  Freshly prepare the primary antibody solutions by diluting the antibody in blocking solution. Depending on the antibody, this information may be recommended by the manufacturer or require previous characterization in the lab to determine the ideal time and temperature.e.  Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.f.  Incubate with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4^°C under low light conditions.g.  Freshly prepare the secondary antibody solutions by diluting the amounts of antibody in blocking solutions recommended by the manufacturer.h.  Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.i.  Incubate with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature under low light conditions.j.  Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.k.  Mount the glass slides using the ProLong antifade Gold reagent (see Step C4).# D.  Imaging1.  Start the microscope and warm up the required lasers. This process can take up to around 30 min depending on the lasers and the microscope.2.  Set up a z-stack acquisition experiment. We used a 0.35um distance per slice with typically 10 to 15 planes to cover most of the cell volume.3.  Focus a single cell (or several clearly defined and healthy single cells per field of view) and set up the number of stacks to be imaged using the signal from the RUSH channel.4. Adjust gain and intensity from the other channels, if necessary.5. Start imaging.6. Repeat Steps D3 and D4 until completing at least 15 cells per time point.7.

Moreover, within eukaryotic genomes there are specific Transcription Error-Enriched genomic Loci (TEELs) which are transcribed by RNA polymerases with significantly higher error rates and hypothesized to have implications in cancer, aging, and diseases such as Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1278","title":"Preparation of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles for Characterisation of Periplasmic Proteins","text":"Preparation of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles for Characterisation of Periplasmic Proteins\n\n# Abstract\n\nBacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are naturally formed by budding from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. OMVs consist of a lipid bilayer identical in composition to the original outer membrane and contain periplasmic content within their lumen. Enriched with specific envelope proteins, OMVs make for an excellent native-like platform to study these proteins in-situ using biophysical methods. Here, we describe in detail the preparation of OMVs from Escherichia coli, which are luminally enriched with periplasmic proteins and uniformly labeled with stable isotopes ( ^2H and ^15N ), suitable for the subsequent characterisation of proteins at atomic resolution in their native environment by solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The ability to perform structural studies of periplasmic components in-situ clears the way to reaching an in-depth understanding of the functional and mechanistic details of this unique cellular compartment.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 0.22um vacuum filtration unit (such as Steritop Quick Release, EMD Millipore, catalog number: S2GPT05RE)\n2. 0.45~A m vacuum  filtration  unit  (such  as  Stericup-HV,  EMD  Millipore,  catalog  number: SCHVU11RE)\n3. 50ml syringe (such as Fisherbrand Sterile Syringes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: 15899152)\n4. 0.45um syringe filter (such as Millex-HP, EMD Millipore, catalog number: SLHP033R)\n5.

Gene cloning and transformationThe complete gene coding for the protein of interest including its preceding periplasmic export signal should be cloned into a suitable plasmid backbone of the pET expression system (such as pET21a). Thereby, additional features such as affinity tags are not necessary and should be omitted. The final plasmid should be transformed into an OMV-overproducing strain such as BL21(DE3)∆ompA (Fantappiè et al., 2014). These steps can be carried out following standard molecular biology techniques. The description of detailed cloning and transformation procedures lies outside the scope of this protocol.B.  Preparation of growth media and buffersPer sample requirements are: 5ml LB medium, 1 L M9 medium, ^25ml DPBSS, 0.2 ml NMR sample buffer (see Recipes for formulations). Supplement growth media with appropriate antibiotics for selection of the strain/plasmid used for expression. When using the pET expression system, use Ampicillin to a final concentration of 100u9mGamma^-1 or Kanamycin to a final concentration of 50umI^-1 . Stock solutions of antibiotics (Ampicillin: 100 m g mV^1 ; Kanamycin: 50 m g m^1-1 ) and IPTG (1 M) can be prepared in H_2O/D_2O , corresponding to the solvent used for growth media.C.

When the optical density reaches OD600 0.4 add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2 m M to induce protein expression.9.  Continue to monitor the optical density OD600 every 30 min.10.

Immediately discard the supernatant.7.  Resuspend the OMV pellet in 200ul NMR sample buffer by gentle vortexing.8.  Save 2~ul of the OMV suspension for subsequent analysis and transfer the remaining suspension to a microscale NMR tube (Figure 2C). OMV suspensions are in our hands stable at 4^°C for up to 2 weeks.()Figure 2. Preparation of OMVs.

Dilute 2ul of the final OMV suspension with 18ul DPBSS.2.  Record  a  UV-Vis  spectrum  of  the  dilute  OMV  suspension  using  a  microvolume spectrophotometer (range: 220-360 nm) and export the spectrum data for further analysis.3.  Correct the exported spectrum for the light-scattering contribution of the OMVs and estimate the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280n m (see Data analysis and Figure 3A). OMV preparations should contain >5~mg/ml total protein to yield NMR spectra of good quality.4.  Prepare two samples for SDS page using denaturing Laemmli Sample Buffer, containing 6u total protein each.5.  Heat-denature one of the samples at 98~^°C for 15 min, keep the second sample at room temperature.6.  Analyze samples by SDS page. Samples of protein-enriched OMVs should result in two prominent bands. One band corresponding to the major porins OmpF/OmpC present in the OMV membrane runs at 37k D a in the heat-denatured sample and results in a contorted, ladderlike pattern between 60 and 70 k D a in the non-heated sample (Figure 3B). A second band, usually not subject to heat-modifiability, should be present at the weight of the overexpressed protein of choice, indicating successful enrichment in the OMVs (Figure 3B).()Figure 3.

They are complex molecular machines consisting of multiple ribosomal proteins and RNAs. To study different aspects of ribosome composition, many methods have been developed over the decades. Here, we describe how to purify ribosomes from the α-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Following this protocol, RNA can be extracted from either purified ribosomes or directly from cell cultures, and ribosomal RNAs quantified using Northern blot.

Grow R. palustris cultures as required by the experimental design. Typical growth conditions that we use are given in Kim and Harwood (1991). However, the composition of the cultivation medium is not important for the protocol we describe here. It also does not matter if cells are grown aerobically or anaerobically. For one typical sample, we usually use 50-70 ml of culture at Abs660 1 (medium is used as blank).2.  Add 10 ml of RNase-free water to one 50-ml centrifuge tube. Place the tube horizontally in a freezer (any sub-zero ^° freezer would work) to form a thin sheet of ice (we usually do this a few days in advance to make sure ice is formed). One tube with ice sheet would be used collect 35ml of cell culture. Prepare as many tubes as required in advance.3.  When the culture reaches the desired growth state, pour the culture directly into the tube containing the ice sheet and place the tube on ice. The purpose of this step is to minimize the time required for the culture to cool down and thus capture the native form of ribosomes. It is also referred as “fast-cool” in some literature (Lawrence et al., 2016).4.  Invert the tubes with culture gently from time to time to facilitate the cooling down of the culture. We usually transfer the now cold culture into a pre-chilled centrifuge tube. This process usually takes 5-10 min in our experience.5.  Spin at 5,000× g for 10 min at 4^°C to collect the cell pellets.6.  Discard the supernatant and freeze the pellets with liquid nitrogen. The frozen cell pellets can now be stored at -80~^°C . In our experience, the ribosome profile of the sample can be preserved for 6 weeks at least.Note: For each sample, we usually collect cells from 70m culture and store the pellets in two 50- ml centrifuge tubes. This can be easily scaled up or down depending on the need of sampling and the availability of equipment.# B.  Purification of ribosomes1.  Prepare two screw-capped ^2m centrifuge tubes for each sample (assuming the pellets are collected in two 50~m centrifuge tubes, see the Note in Procedure A). Add 500~ul Zirconia/Silica beads to each tube and autoclave all of the tubes.2.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 1.2m cold lysis buffer in each 50~ml centrifuge tube. Use pipet to mix well and transfer the resuspended sample to the _2~m~ screw-cap tube containing Zirconia/Silica beads.3.  In a 4^°C room, lyse the resuspended cells with a Biospec Mini-Beadbeater-24 at 3,500 rpm for 1 min and then chill them on ice for 1min. Repeat 3 more times, 4 times in total. Note: The setup of beadbeater cycle, speed and time may need to be adjusted according to the species of interest.4.  Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,000× g with a tabletop microcentrifuge at 4^°C to remove the beads and cell debris.5.  Collect 1~m of supernatant from each tube. Combine supernatants from the same sample if needed ( ^2m of supernatant for each sample in our setting, see the Note in Procedure A). Centrifuge for 30 min at 30,000× g at 4^°C with an ultracentrifuge to further clarify the lysates. Collect the supernatant.6.  Centrifuge the supernatant from last step at 100,000× g with an ultracentrifuge for four hours at 4^°C to pellet the ribosomes.7.  After the spin, carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the pelleted ribosomes. The pelleted ribosomes, when abundant, visually resemble a contact lens.8. Without disturbing the pellets, carefully add 200-500~ul Buffer A1 to the centrifuge tube containing the pelleted ribosomes. Leave the samples on ice overnight to allow the ribosomes to dissolve in the buffer.9.  On the next day, gently mix the dissolved ribosomes. Take a sample and determine the absorbance at 260 n m (A_260) . The volume of the sample taken depends on the concentration and the setup of spectrometer. The sample can also be diluted if necessary. In our experience, a typical yield from one sample is 400ul of 20 relative units (R.U.) of A260 in total. Note that the yield can vary significantly depending on the experiment.10. Adjust all the samples to the same concentration. The minimum concentration of ribosome for the following analysis is 50~R.U . of A260/ml. Freeze the purified ribosomes with liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C for further analysis. The purified ribosomes are suitable for further assays such as separation on a sucrose gradient or for isolation and analysis of rRNA associated with ribosomes.# C.  Analyze rRNA by electrophoresis and Northern blot.This procedure can be applied to total RNA isolated from cultures or from purified ribosomes. RNA is purified following either a QIAzol-based method (see Yin and Harwood, 2020) or the commercially available protocol for the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For the QIAzol-based method, we typically start with 400ul of an 0.1 absorbance (RU of A260) preparation of ribosomes and the method yields a 15ul volume of approximately 500n gR N Almul. .An optional step is to use an RNA ScreenTape System (Agilent) to get a snapshot of the rRNA profile. To specifically detect rRNA by  Northern blot, rRNA  has to be first separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. Since agarose gels are usually too thick to be used in the commonly used electro-transfer system, this calls for a capillary transfer system (upward or downward) to transfer RNA from the gel to a membrane for subsequent Northern blot detection. This procedure will be described here in detail. For Northern blot detection, we use a non-radioactive system and follow its commercially available manual (DIG). This greatly saves time and effort as described in detail in the accompanying protocol “Charging state analysis of transfer RNA from an α-proteobacterium” (Yin and Harwood, 2020). The principle of designing and generating a DIGlabeled probe is also described there.1.  In a 50mI centrifuge tube, add 0.2textbfg agarose to ^20m 1x TBE buffer. Melt agarose in a microwave and pour the gel.2.  Mix 1 µg total RNA with _2× loading dye. Heat at 70~^°C for 10 min. Immediately chill on ice for 3 min. Spin briefly.3.  Analyze the sample on an agarose gel with a running buffer of 1x TBE buffer. For a gel of 10 cm in length, a one-hour run at 100~or usually achieves satisfactory separation. After electrophoresis with a setting like this,16S rRNA is usually in the middle of the gel.4.  After the electrophoresis, immerse the gel in 20× SSC twice, each time for 10m i n .5.  Assemble the transfer apparatus as follows:TopLight weight such as a pipet tip box1 Whatman filter paper connecting to the reservoir, immersed in _20× SSC1 Whatman filter paper, slightly bigger than the gel, immersed in _20× SSCAgarose gel, the side with RNA facing downMembrane cut to gel size, pre-immersed in 20× SSC2 Whatman filter papers, slightly bigger than the gel, immersed in 20× SSCDry paper towels 20 sheets at least)BottomNote: This describes the transfer apparatus for downward transfer. Slightly modified setup can be used for upward transfer.Set up the capillary transfer system as shown in Figure 1. Leave on bench overnight.()transfer apparatusFigure 1. Capillary transfer system (RNA transferred downward from gel to membrane)6.  The membrane can be cross-linked the next morning. One option to cross-link is to place the membrane 1-2 cm from a shortwave UV light, the side with sample facing UV light, and expose it to UV for 10 min. Next, follow commercially available protocol for DIG system for Northern blot (Sessions in Hybridization and Immunological detection in https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigmaaldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/12039672910bul.pdf).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of -80°C Cell Pellets\nGrow R. palustris cultures as required by the experimental design.\nAdd 10 ml of RNase-free water to one 50-ml centrifuge tube and place the tube horizontally in a freezer to form a thin sheet of ice.\nWhen the culture reaches the desired growth state, pour the culture directly into the tube containing the ice sheet and place the tube on ice.\nInvert the tubes with culture gently from time to time to facilitate the cooling down of the culture.\nSpin at 5,000× g for 10 min at 4°C to collect the cell pellets.\nDiscard the supernatant and freeze the pellets with liquid nitrogen.\n## Purification of Ribosomes\nPrepare two screw-capped 2m centrifuge tubes for each sample and add 500~ul Zirconia/Silica beads to each tube.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1.2m cold lysis buffer and transfer the resuspended sample to the 2~m~ screw-cap tube containing Zirconia/Silica beads.\n## Cell Lysis\nLysis the resuspended cells with a Biospec Mini-Beadbeater-24 at 3,500 rpm for 1 min.\nChill the cells on ice for 1min and repeat the lysis process 3 more times.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 20,000× g with a tabletop microcentrifuge at 4°C to remove the beads and cell debris.\nCollect 1~m of supernatant from each tube and combine supernatants from the same sample if needed.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 30,000× g at 4°C with an ultracentrifuge to further clarify the lysates.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 100,000× g with an ultracentrifuge for four hours at 4°C to pellet the ribosomes.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the pelleted ribosomes.\n## Ribosome Dissolution\nAdd 200-500~ul Buffer A1 to the centrifuge tube containing the pelleted ribosomes.\nLeave the samples on ice overnight to allow the ribosomes to dissolve in the buffer.\n## Ribosome Quantification\nDetermine the absorbance at 260 n m (A_260) of the dissolved ribosomes.\nAdjust all the samples to the same concentration.\n## Analyze rRNA by Electrophoresis and Northern Blot\n## RNA Purification\nPurify RNA following either a QIAzol-based method or the commercially available protocol for the miRNeasy Mini Kit.\nUse an RNA ScreenTape System to get a snapshot of the rRNA profile.\n## Electrophoresis\nMix 1 µg total RNA with 2× loading dye and heat at 70~^°C for 10 min.\nAnalyze the sample on an agarose gel with a running buffer of 1x TBE buffer.\n## RNA Transfer\nImmerse the gel in 20× SSC twice, each time for 10 min.\nAssemble the transfer apparatus and set up the capillary transfer system.\n## Northern Blot Detection\nCross-link the membrane by placing it 1-2 cm from a shortwave UV light.\nFollow commercially available protocol for DIG system for Northern blot.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Microbiology & Virology"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1316","title":"Reference-free Association Mapping from Sequencing Reads Using k-mers","text":"Reference-free Association Mapping from Sequencing Reads Using k-mers\n\n# Abstract\n\nAssociation mapping is the process of linking phenotypes with genotypes. In genome wide association  studies  (GWAS),  individuals  are  first  genotyped  using  microarrays  or  by  aligning sequenced reads to reference genomes. However, both these approaches rely on reference genomes which limits their application to organisms with no or incomplete reference genomes. To address this, reference free association mapping methods have been developed. Here we present the protocol of an alignment free method for association studies which is based on counting K -mers in sequenced reads, testing for associations between k -mers and the phenotype of interest, and local assembly of the k -mers of statistical significance. The method can map associations of categorical phenotypes to sequence and structural variations without requiring prior sequencing of reference genomes.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe overview of the procedure of association mapping from sequencing reads with k-mers using HAWK is shown in Figure 1. The steps are described in more details below. More information on the process is available at https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK/blob/master/README.md.()Figure 1. Overview of association mapping from sequencing reads with k-mers using HAWKA.  Counting and sorting k-mers1.  Count k -mers in each sample by running Jellyfish or Jellyfish 2. To do this, modify the example scripts available at https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK/tree/master/supplements.2.  countKmers_jf2 or countKmers_jf1 can be used to count and sort k-mers using Jellyfish 2 or Jellyfish respectively when the reads from each sample are in a separate folder whereas countKmers_jf2_sra or countKmers_jf1_sra can be used when reads first need to be downloaded from the sequence read archive (SRA).3.  The scripts will write the names of the sorted k-mer count files in sorted_files.txt and t he total k-mer counts in each sample in total_kmer_counts.txt.# B.  Running HAWK1.  Create a file named gwas_info.txt containing three columns separated by tabs in each row giving a sample ID, male/female/unknown denoted by M/F/U and Case/Control status of the sample for each sample.2.  Copy the files sorted_files.txt and total_kmer_counts.txt into a folder as well as the file gwas_info.txt3.  Copy the scripts runHawk and runAbyss into the folder, edit the variables hawkDir, eigenstratDir and isDiploid, and run ./runHawk This will complete the following steps: a.  Identifying k-mers associated with cases and controls. This will be done by running ‘hawk’ and will generate the initial lists of k-mers associated with cases and controls in files ‘case_out_w_bonf.kmerDiff’ and ‘control_out_w_bonf.kmerDiff’ respectively as well as the files to be used by Eigenstrat to determine population structure.b.  Determining  population  structure.  Population  structure  will  be  detected  by  running Eigenstrat. Optionally, the population structure can be investigated by running the R script pca_plot.R. This will read the ‘gwas_eigenstrat.evec’ file generated by Eigenstrat and output the principal component analysis (PCA) plot in ‘pca_plot.eps’. Adjust the variables PC1 and PC2 to select along which principal components the data will be plotted.c.  Correcting for population structure. The p-values for the k-mers identified in Step B3a will be adjusted for confounding factors such as population structure, total number of k-mers and sex. The k -mers found significantly associated with cases and controls will be in files case_kmers.fasta and control_kmers.fasta. Additional information about the k -mers will be in ‘pvals_case_top_merged.txt’ and ‘pvals_control_top_merged.txt.’C.  Assembling k-mers1.  Edit the variable ‘abyssDir’ in the script ‘runAbyss’ and run ./runAbyss This will assemble the k-mers to generate one sequence for each associated region and the sequences  associated  with  cases  and  controls  will  be  in  ‘case_abyss.25_49.fa’  and ‘control_abyss.25_49.fa’ respectively.# D.  Downstream analysisOnce the k-mers or the assembled sequences are obtained, they can be analyzed in a number of ways.1.  To obtain summary stats such as average p-values, average counts of constituent k-mers and average number of times they are present in cases and controls edit the HAWK directory, input filename, and whether the sequences are from case or control in the script ‘runKmerSummary’ (at https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK/tree/master/supplements) and run ./runKmerSummary (see https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK for details).2.  If no reference genome is available, BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) the sequences to check for hits to sequences in related organisms and analyze the matched sequences.3.  If a reference genome is available, the k -mers can be mapped to the reference using a tool such as Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and their positions and p-values can be visualized  using  Manhattan  plots.  Edit  the  shell  script  ‘runBowtie2’  and  the  R  script ‘manhattan_plasmid.R’, available at https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK/tree/master/ecoli_analysis  to  align  the  k-mers  to  areference and generate Manhattan plots respectively.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Overview of Association Mapping\nThe overview of the procedure of association mapping from sequencing reads with k-mers using HAWK is shown in Figure 1.\n## Counting and Sorting K-mers\nCount k-mers in each sample by running Jellyfish or Jellyfish 2.\n## Counting K-mers using Jellyfish\nModify the example scripts available at https://github.com/atifrahman/HAWK/tree/master/supplements.\nUse countKmers_jf2 or countKmers_jf1 to count and sort k-mers using Jellyfish 2 or Jellyfish respectively.\nUse countKmers_jf2_sra or countKmers_jf1_sra when reads first need to be downloaded from the sequence read archive (SRA).\n## Output Files\nThe scripts will write the names of the sorted k-mer count files in sorted_files.txt.\nThe total k-mer counts in each sample will be written in total_kmer_counts.txt.\n## Running HAWK\nCreate a file named gwas_info.txt containing three columns separated by tabs in each row giving a sample ID, male/female/unknown denoted by M/F/U and Case/Control status of the sample for each sample.\nCopy the files sorted_files.txt and total_kmer_counts.txt into a folder as well as the file gwas_info.txt.\n## Running HAWK and Eigenstrat\nCopy the scripts runHawk and runAbyss into the folder, edit the variables hawkDir, eigenstratDir and isDiploid, and run./runHawk.\nIdentifying k-mers associated with cases and controls will be done by running ‘hawk’.\nDetermining population structure will be done by running Eigenstrat.\nOptionally, the population structure can be investigated by running the R script pca_plot.R.\n## Correcting for Population Structure\nThe p-values for the k-mers identified in Step B3a will be adjusted for confounding factors such as population structure, total number of k-mers and sex.\nThe k-mers found significantly associated with cases and controls will be in files case_kmers.fasta and control_kmers.fasta.\n## Assembling K-mers\nEdit the variable ‘abyssDir’ in the script ‘runAbyss’ and run./runAbyss.\nThe k-mers will be assembled to generate one sequence for each associated region.\nThe sequences associated with cases and controls will be in ‘case_abyss.25_49.fa’ and ‘control_abyss.25_49.fa’ respectively.\n## Downstream Analysis\n## Obtaining Summary Statistics\nEdit the HAWK directory, input filename, and whether the sequences are from case or control in the script ‘runKmerSummary’.\nRun./runKmerSummary to obtain summary stats such as average p-values, average counts of constituent k-mers and average number of times they are present in cases and controls.\n## BLAST Analysis\nIf no reference genome is available, BLAST the sequences to check for hits to sequences in related organisms.\nAnalyze the matched sequences.\n## Mapping to Reference Genome\nIf a reference genome is available, the k-mers can be mapped to the reference using a tool such as Bowtie 2.\nTheir positions and p-values can be visualized using Manhattan plots.\nEdit the shell script ‘runBowtie2’ and the R script ‘manhattan_plasmid.R’ to align the k-mers to a reference and generate Manhattan plots respectively.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Bioinformatics Methods"}}

At every step of the protocol you should wear nitrile/latex gloves to avoid RNase contamination.A.  Total RNA purification using the hot phenol method and RNA quality control by electrophoresis1.  Prepare a pre-culture by inoculating 5ml of TSB medium with a single colony of S. flexneri 5a M90T from a Congo red tryptone soy agar plate and grow overnight (negeta h) at 37~^°C with agitation (150 RPM). Note: Ensure that the colonies used are secretion-competent (forming red colonies on the plate due to Congo red absorption) (Sharma and Puhar, 2019).2.  Subculture by diluting 100ul of the pre-culture in 10m of TSB (1:100 dilution).3.  Grow to O D_600=0.3 with shaking. This will take approximately 2 h if the medium is pre-warmed.4.  Mix the culture with ^2m of cold stop solution.5.  Incubate the mixed culture with the stop solution on ice for 30m i n . Note: To stabilize the RNA and prevent degradation, incubate it for at least 30 min, but not longer than _2h on ice.6.  Transfer the culture into a 15m tube.7.  Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,200xg at 4^°C .8.  Remove the supernatant by decanting. Keep 2ml of supernatant to resuspend the pellet in it.9.  Transfer the resuspended cells into two 1.5m tubes.10. Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,200× g at 4^°C .11. Discard the supernatant by decanting. Note: At this point the samples could be frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at - -80^°C Samples are stable for months.12. Purify the total RNA using the hot phenol method as follows.13. Resuspend cell pellets in 500ul of lysis solution at room temperature.14. Under the chemical hood add 500~ul of phenol pH 4 pre-warmed to 65~^°C . Mix by inversion at least 20 times. Note: Pre-warm in a heat block the phenol before starting the RNA purification.15. Vortex vigorously for _20s .16. Incubate 5 min at 65^°C in the heat block.17. Centrifuge 3 min at 13,800× g at room temperature. Note: If the centrifugation step is done at 4~^°C the SDS is going to precipitate and the solution turns white, which does not affect the efficacy of the process but makes it difficult to differentiate the two phases. After this centrifugation time you should see two phases, the upper one should be whitish (when the SDS is cooling down it becomes insoluble). RNA is in the aqueous phase(upper phase), while in the clearly white disk interphase there are protein layers and DNA,whereas lipids and some other cellular components are dissolved in the lower transparent phase that is the organic phase.18. Transfer the upper phase (500u1) to a new RNase-free tube under the chemical hood.19. Add 1ml of cold (4^°C) absolute ethanol.20. Mix thoroughly by vortexing for 5 s until you see a homogeneous mixture.21. Centrifuge at 16,200xg for 5 min at 4^°C .22. Discard supernatant that contains the ethanol solution by decanting. Note: At this step you can see a white/transparent pellet on the bottom.23. Add 1 ml of 80% ethanol at room temperature. Shake the tube vigorously for 10s . Note: Do not use the vortex, it can detach the pellet from the bottom.24. Centrifuge at 16,200xg for 2 min at 4^°C .25. Discard the supernatant by decanting.26. Centrifuge (short spin) the tubes and discard the remaining liquid by pipetting.27. Dry samples at room temperature by leaving the tubes uncapped on the bench. Note: Once that the sample is completely dry ddotcal I turns transparent. It can take 10 min to obtain a completely dry sample.28. Resuspend the RNA sample in 100ul of nuclease free water.29. Check the quality of the purified RNA in a 1% agarose gel in TAE 1× as follows.30. Prepare the sample to be analyzed in a 1.5m tube. Add 1ul of sample plus 5ul of RNA loading buffer 2x and 4ul of nuclease free water.31. Heat the sample for 5 min at 65^°C for secondary and tertiary structures denaturation.32. Cool down the tube in ice for 5 min.33. Spin down for 2 s and load the gel.34. Run the gel in TAE 1× buffer for 40 min at 100or35. Stain the gel with 3× -concentrated Gel Red for 10m i n .36. Wash the gel with ^20ml of nuclease free water for 10 min shaking at room temperature.37. Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 3A). If the total RNA purification was successful, the 23S and 16S are visible as clear, heavy bands, while in the lower part of the gel weaker tRNA bands are observed. It is not possible to see mRNAs. In case of RNA degradation, bands appear as smear.38. Quantify the RNA in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Figure 3B). Note: At least 20 μg (10 μg for each of two conditions) of total RNA are necessary to continue with the protocol. Typical concentrations should be around 500-900 ng/ml. Very successful purifications yield up to 1,500 ng/ml RNA.()()Figure 3. Total RNA quality control. A. Separation of total RNA from three replicates in a 1% agarose gel in TAE of Shigella flexneri 5a M90T as total RNA quality control. B. Examples of typical values obtained from total RNA quantification in a NanoDrop. The 260/280 ratio should be around 1.88-2.00.39. Freeze the RNA samples at -20~^°C . The RNA samples are stable for months.B.  DNase treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA from total RNAProtocol volumes are for one reaction, but every step is scalable to two or more reactions.1.  Dilute 10u of total RNA to a final volume of 30ul using nuclease free water.2.  Denature RNA in nuclease free water for 5 min at 65~^°C in the heat block.3.  Cool down in ice for 5 min.4.  Prepare a reaction mix containing the components listed in Table 1. The indicated quantities aresufficient for one sample containing 10u of RNA.Table 1. DNase reaction mix for one reactionNote: 1 Unit of DNase I for 1 μg of total RNA.()5.  Add the reaction mix to the RNA sample tube on ice.6.  Incubate the reaction mix for 60m i n at 37^°C in the heat block. Note: Be sure that the heat block is at the correct temperature, DNase works efficiently at 37^°C .7.  Add to the reaction tube 60ul of nuclease free water to obtain 100ul final volume.C.  RNA clean-up by chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation1.  Add 100ul of CHISAM to the reaction tube under the chemical hood.2.  Mix with the vortex vigorously for 15:s .3.  Centrifuge the tube for 2 min at 13,800× g,4^°C .4.  Under the chemical hood transfer 100~ul from the aqueous phase (upper) that contains the RNA to a new 1.5m tube. Discard the organic phase (lower), proteins and salts from the buffer are dissolved in this phase.5.  Repeat Steps C1-C4.6.  Add 300~ul of cold absolute ethanol (3 sample volumes), 10~ul of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 1~ul of glycogen (20m g/m l) .7.  Vortex the mix vigorously for 5s .8.  Incubate the tube at -20~^°C for 30m i n . Note: This step is optional, but it is good to do it to decrease the loss of RNA in the next steps.9.  Centrifuge at 16,200xg (or maximum speed) for 30 min at 4^°C . Note: Centrifugation step can be for longer time. The minimum is 30 min, but it could be for 2 to ^4h .10. Discard the supernatant carefully by decanting. Note: On the bottom of the tube there should be a white pellet. Discard the supernatant without detaching the pellet.11. Add 1~ml of 80% ethanol at room temperature to wash the RNA.12. Mix the tube by inverting 20 times.13. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 13,800× g,4^°C .14. Discard the supernatant by decanting.15. Centrifuge (short spin) and discard the remaining liquid with a 100ul pipette.16. Keep the tubes open on ice to dry the samples. Note: The time required to dry the samples depends on how well the liquid phase was removed (usually it takes 10-15 min). The pellet is completely transparent once it is completely dry.17. Resuspend the total RNA in 23ul of nuclease free water.18. Check the integrity of the DNase-free RNA by visual inspection of the 23S and 16S band on 1% agarose gel as performed after the total RNA extraction.19. Prepare the running sample as in Steps A30-A37.20. Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 4A).21. Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop sp1e ctrophot2o meter (t3h e final RNA concentration should be 600–1,000 n g/m l) (Figure 4B). It is normal to detect lower concentrations after the process, asthe presence of DNA increase the absorbance of the sample.()()Figure 4. Total RNA quality control after DNase treatment. A. Separation of total RNA from three replicates in a 1% agarose gel in TAE of Shigella flexneri 5a M90T as total RNA quality control. B. Examples of typical values obtained from total RNA quantification after DNase treatment in a NanoDrop.22. Freeze the RNA samples at -20~^°C . The RNA samples are stables for months.D.  PCR to verify the removal of genomic DNATo be sure that there is no trace of DNA in the RNA samples it is extremely important to check the absence of genomic DNA by PCR.1.  Use 1 ul (1 u) of the DNase treated RNA sample as a template to check for the absence of genomic DNA.2.  As a positive control use 10 ng of genomic DNA from S. flexneri 5a M90T. Genomic DNA can be extracted using the phenol-chloroform protocol as described in (He, 2011).3.  As a negative control use a reaction without any template.4.  Prepare the PCR mix (Table 2). The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample. Note: The oligos used here amplify a ~909 bp long product of the hfq gene (303 nt) from S.flexneri 5a M90T including 300 bp upstream and 300 bp downstream of the hfq gene.Table 2. Reaction mix for the PCR control()5.  PCR reaction settings (Table 3).Table 3. Settings for control PCR()6.  Check the product in a 1% agarose gel as follows.7.  Prepare the sample to be analyzed. Add 6ul of sample plus 2ul of DNA loading buffer 6x.8.  Run the 1% agarose gel in TAE 1x buffer for 40m i n at 100or9.  Stain the gel with Gel Red 3x for 10m i n .10. Wash the gel with nuclease free water.11. Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 5).()Figure 5. Control PCR to verify the absence of genomic DNA with the hfq gene plus 300 pb upstream and downstream of Shigella flexneri 5a M90T as target using genomic DNA as a positive control. Agarose gel 1% in TAE 1x. The absence of a PCR product seen as a 909 bp band in lanes 2-4 indicates that the purified RNA is devoid of DNA contaminations.# E.  rRNA depletionRibosomal RNA is the most abundant RNA species. If rRNA is not removed, most reads from sequencing will originate from rRNA. As a consequence, samples which are compared need to all either have or be devoid of rRNA, or else the sequencing depth will be very different and statistical analysis cannot be performed. The TEX treatment described in the next section to enrich for primary RNA removes all RNA that is not tri-phosphorylated including rRNA, making this library rRNAdepleted. Therefore, to allow the comparison of TEX-treated with mock-treated samples, rRNA needs to be specifically depleted first from total RNA before splitting the RNA into two for further treatment.rRNA depletion is carried out using a commercial kit, which specifically depletes bacterial rRNA, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Specific depletion of bacterial rRNA generally relies on hybridization with tagged pan-bacterial probes that recognize conserved sequences in rRNA, followed by removal of captured rRNAs, for example by precipitation with magnetic beads that bind the tag of the probes.We have used the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria from Illumina, but unfortunately it is not available anymore on the market. However, it can be replaced with any hybridization-based kit of your choice. We provided some suggestions in the Material section.F.  Terminator exonuclease (TEX) treatment to enrich for primary transcripts1.  Prepare two (TEX- and T E X+ ) 1.5ml reaction tubes with 10ug(10uI) each of DNase I treated RNA (from the same sample) in nuclease free water.2.  Denature RNAs for 2 min at 90~^°C .3.  Cool down on ice for 5 min.4.  Add to each tube the reaction mix described in Table 4. The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample containing 10u of RNA:Table 4. Reaction mix for TEX treatment()Note: The final reaction volume is going to be 20 μl after adding the enzyme for the TEX+ sample or water for the TEX- sample.5.  Add 1~ul of nuclease free water to the TEX- sample.6.  Add 1 μl of TEX (1 U/ml) to the T E X+ sample.7.  Incubate for 60m i n at 30~^°C in the thermo cycler. Note: This step could be carried in a heat block, but the temperature variation and liquid evaporation are important factors that hamper good results, and these effects are stronger in a heat block.8.  Add 80~ul of nuclease free water to obtain 100ul final volume.9.  Add 100ul of Phe-CHISAM to the reaction tube under the chemical hood.10. Mix with the vortex vigorously for 15:s .11. Centrifuge the tube for 2 min at 13,800× g,4^°C .12. Transfer 100~ul of the upper phase that contains the RNA to a new tube under the chemical hood.13. Repeat Steps F9 to F12.14. Add 300~ul of cold absolute ethanol (3 sample volumes), 10~ul of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 2ul of glycogen (20m g/m l) .15. Vortex the sample vigorously.16. Incubate the tube at -20~^°C overnight (around 16h ), but could be longer, for example over the weekend. Note: This step is very important. It helps complete recovery of the RNA.17. Centrifuge at 16,200xg for 1h at 4^°C . Note: The centrifugation step could be for longer time. Minimum 1 h, but could be for 2-4 h.18. Discard the aqueous phase carefully by decanting. Note: On the bottom of the tube there should be a white pellet. Discard the aqueous phase without detaching the pellet. In the case that you do not see any pellet before discarding the supernatant, just add 10 μl of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 2 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml) and repeat Steps FI6 to F18 ).19.  Add 1~ml of cold 80% ethanol at room temperature to wash the RNA.20.  Centrifuge for 5 min at 13,800× g,4^°C .21.  Discard the aqueous phase by decanting.22.  Centrifuge (short spin) and discard the remaining liquid with a 100ul pipette.23.  Keep the tubes open on ice to dry the samples. Note: The time required to dry the samples depends on how well the liquid phase was removed. It can take around 10-15 min. The pellet will be completely transparent once it is completely dry.24. Resuspend the RNA in 13ul of nuclease free water.25. Check the integrity of the TEX- and T E X+ treated RNA by visual inspection on 1% agarose gel.26. Prepare the running sample as in Steps A29-A36.27. Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 6).()Figure 6. Shigella flexneri 5a M90T RNA treated (T E x+) and untreated (TEX-) with TEXNote: It is normal not to see clear bands in this gel for the mRNA, which is a mix of different transcripts of variable length. To see a smear in the gel means that the treatment was successful. If you do not have a high quantity of RNA maybe you will see only tRNAs.28. Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (final RNA concentration should be 20 ng/ml).29. Freeze the RNA samples at -20~^°C . The RNA samples are stables for months.G. RNA 5’ Pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) treatment of RNA to remove terminal phosphates In the following steps, the 5^. -ends of the RNA prepared in Procedure F is modified with a linkerRNA-adaptor of known sequence, which allows the identification of TSS with single nucleotide precision. This is necessary because the sequence of adaptors added during library preparation for sequencing can be a trade secret (the full sequence of Illumina adaptors was only revealed recently and other platforms using adaptors of unknown sequence exist). During bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results, the sequence of adaptors is occasionally incompletely removed from reads and the remaining nucleotides could be confused for transcribed bases if they happened to align with the DNA sequence. However, this problem can be avoided by introducing the RNA adaptor of known sequence between the adaptors and the TSS. Moreover, the linker-RNA-adaptor allows to univocally identify 5^ ends present before RNA shearing during library preparation. To allow the ligation of adaptors to the 5' end of the linker-RNA-adaptor during library preparation, the linkerRNA-adaptor must have a triphosphate in the 5^ end.1.  Denature remaining 10ul of T E X+ and TEX- treated RNA for 1 min at 90~^°C .2.  Cool down on ice for 5 min.3.  Prepare RppH mix as described in the Table 5. The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample:Table 5. Reaction mix for RppH reaction of TEX treated RNA()4.  Incubate at 37^°C for 30 min in the thermocycler.5.  Add 80ul of nuclease free water and follow the Steps F8-F23.6.  Resuspend the RNA sample in 13ul of nuclease free water.7.  Check the integrity of the RppH treated RNA by visual inspection on 1% agarose gel. Note: This step it not strictly necessary, and with every step you are losing some RNA. The gel should look similar as the one shown in Figure 6.8.  Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop spectrophotometer.H.  Linker-RNA-adaptor phosphorylation prior to ligation to T E X+ and TEX- libraries1.  Denature 100 pmol 10~ul) of the linker-RNA-adaptor per sample dissolved in nuclease free water for 5 min at 90~^°C .2.  Cool down on ice for 5 min. Note: You can keep the oligo on ice for longer time while you prepare the reaction.3.  Prepare the T4 PNK mix according the Table 6.4.  Incubate at 37^°C for 30 min in the thermo cycler.5.  Add 80ul of nuclease free water, follow the Steps F8-F23.6.  Resuspend the RNA sample in 10ul of nuclease free water. Note: After this step the RNA adaptor can be frozen at -20~^°C and used later.Table 6. Reaction mix for T4 PNK phosphorylation of the linker-RNA-adaptor()I.  Linker-RNA-adaptor ligation to T E X+ and TEX- samplesThe efficiency of linker-RNA-adaptor ligation is around 80-90% .1.  Denature the phosphorylated RNA adaptor (10ul) and RNAs treated with RppH ( (10u//) at 65^°C for 5 min.2.  Cool down on ice for 5 min.3.  Prepare the T4 RNA ligase mix as described in Table 7 (quantities described on the table are for only one sample, if you are processing more samples just scale them up).Table 7. Reaction mix for linker-RNA-adaptor ligation()4.  Incubate at 25^°C for 16h in the thermo cycler.5.  Add 60ul of nuclease free water.6.  Stop the reaction and precipitate the reaction following Steps F9-F23.7.  Resuspend the RNA sample in 23ul of nuclease free water. Note: Resuspension volume is defined by the sequencing facilities that you have decided to use. The RNA concentration in our case was 150 ng in 23mu l. .8.  Quantify the RNA adaptor by NanoDrop spectrophotometer.J.  Library preparation for Illumina sequencingLibrary preparation for sequencing and RNA-sequencing is performed at the service platform or company of your choice. Stranded libraries must be prepared to identify the coding DNA strand. Paired-end sequencing with 150 nt read length should be performed. We used a TrueSeq library on a HiSeq 2000 platform. For microbial genomes, 10-20 M reads per sample will provide appropriate sequencing depth, but 5 M it is enough for an acceptable coverage.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation for RNA Purification\nClean pipets, centrifuges, bench, chemical hood, equipment for gels, and marker pen with RNaseZap to ensure everything is RNase-free.\nWear nitrile/latex gloves to avoid RNase contamination throughout the protocol.\n## Total RNA Purification using Hot Phenol Method and RNA Quality Control by Electrophoresis\nPrepare a pre-culture by inoculating 5ml of TSB medium with a single colony of S. flexneri 5a M90T and grow overnight at 37°C with agitation (150 RPM).\n## Subculture and Growth\nSubculture by diluting 100ul of the pre-culture in 10ml of TSB (1:100 dilution).\nGrow to OD_600=0.3 with shaking.\n## Cell Harvesting and RNA Stabilization\nMix the culture with 2ml of cold stop solution.\nIncubate the mixed culture with the stop solution on ice for 30 minutes.\n## Cell Pellet Collection and Washing\nTransfer the culture into a 15ml tube and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 16,200xg at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by decanting, keeping 2ml to resuspend the pellet.\n## RNA Extraction\nResuspend cell pellets in 500ul of lysis solution at room temperature.\nAdd 500ul of phenol pH 4 pre-warmed to 65°C, mix by inversion, and vortex vigorously for 20 seconds.\n## Phase Separation and RNA Precipitation\nIncubate for 5 minutes at 65°C, then centrifuge for 3 minutes at 13,800xg at room temperature.\nTransfer the upper phase to a new RNase-free tube, add 1ml of cold absolute ethanol, and mix thoroughly.\n## RNA Washing and Drying\nCentrifuge at 16,200xg for 5 minutes at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and add 1ml of 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge again, discard the supernatant, and dry the samples at room temperature.\n## RNA Resuspension and Quality Control\nResuspend the RNA sample in 100ul of nuclease-free water.\nCheck the quality of the purified RNA in a 1% agarose gel in TAE 1×.\n## DNase Treatment to Remove Contaminating Genomic DNA from Total RNA\nDilute 10ul of total RNA to a final volume of 30ul using nuclease-free water.\n## DNase Reaction\nDenature RNA in nuclease-free water for 5 minutes at 65°C.\nPrepare a reaction mix containing the components listed in Table 1 and add it to the RNA sample tube on ice.\n## RNA Clean-up\nIncubate the reaction mix for 60 minutes at 37°C, then add 60ul of nuclease-free water.\nPerform chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation as described.\n## PCR to Verify the Removal of Genomic DNA\nUse 1ul of the DNase-treated RNA sample as a template to check for the absence of genomic DNA.\n## PCR Reaction\nPrepare the PCR mix according to Table 2.\nPerform PCR reaction settings as described in Table 3.\n## rRNA Depletion\nPerform rRNA depletion using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nSpecific depletion of bacterial rRNA generally relies on hybridization with tagged pan-bacterial probes.\n## Terminator Exonuclease (TEX) Treatment to Enrich for Primary Transcripts\nPrepare two reaction tubes with 10ug of DNase I treated RNA in nuclease-free water.\n## TEX Reaction\nDenature RNAs for 2 minutes at 90°C, then cool down on ice for 5 minutes.\nAdd the reaction mix described in Table 4 to each tube.\n## RNA 5’ Pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) Treatment of RNA to Remove Terminal Phosphates\nDenature remaining 10ul of TEX+ and TEX- treated RNA for 1 minute at 90°C.\n## RppH Reaction\nPrepare RppH mix as described in Table 5.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 minutes in the thermocycler.\n## Linker-RNA-Adaptor Phosphorylation Prior to Ligation to TEX+ and TEX- Libraries\nDenature 100 pmol (10ul) of the linker-RNA-adaptor per sample dissolved in nuclease-free water for 5 minutes at 90°C.\n## T4 PNK Reaction\nPrepare the T4 PNK mix according to Table 6.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 minutes in the thermocycler.\n## Linker-RNA-Adaptor Ligation to TEX+ and TEX- Samples\nDenature the phosphorylated RNA adaptor and RNAs treated with RppH at 65°C for 5 minutes.\n## Ligation Reaction\nPrepare the T4 RNA ligase mix as described in Table 7.\nIncubate at 25°C for 16 hours in the thermocycler.\n## Library Preparation for Illumina Sequencing\nPerform library preparation for sequencing and RNA-sequencing at the service platform or company of your choice.\nStranded libraries must be prepared to identify the coding DNA strand.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Genomics Technologies"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1405","title":"Isolation and Quantification of Extracellular DNA from Biofluids","text":"Isolation and Quantification of Extracellular DNA from Biofluids\n\n# Abstract\n\nExtracellular DNA is studied as a diagnostic biomarker, but also as a factor involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases due to its pro-inflammatory properties. Extracellular DNA can be extracted from plasma, urine, saliva or other biofluids using standard DNA isolation procedures and specialized commercial kits. Sample preparation for isolation is important, freezing and thawing may affect the amount of extracellular DNA extracted. Subsequent centrifugations remove cells and cell debris from the samples to obtain true extracellular DNA. Small volume of samples especially from animal experiments is often an issue and it affects the DNA yield. Very short fragments (<100b p) can be lost during isolation and are difficult to quantify using PCR. Fluorometric methods asses all stained DNA fragments. Selecting the method for quantification of extracellular DNA is crucial and combination of at least two methods is ideal. Standardization of procedures or at least their reporting in research papers is of utmost importance for comparison of results.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. Tubes for sample collection\n\na.

Collect samples for the measurement of extracellular DNA into appropriate tubes. Collect blood in the EDTA-containing tube (purple). Collect urine and saliva into sterile Falcon tubes or Eppendorf tubes. Notes: a. The processing of samples is important and is the main source of technical variability. Serum collection tubes induce blood clotting and enable the release of DNA from blood cells during the coagulation process. Heparin-containing tubes prevent coagulation, but do not inhibit activity of deoxyribonucleases that are likely able to cleave extracellular DNA. EDTA inhibits activity of deoxyribonucleases and is the preferred anticoagulant. The ratio of anti-coagulant and blood should be consistent. This is easy to achieve in blood collection from human probands but can be difficult when blood from experimental animals is collected.b. Hemolysis increases the concentration of extracellular DNA in plasma. Hemolysed samples should  be  excluded  from  the  final  analysis of  experiments.  Both,  stimulated and unstimulated saliva can be collected for the assessment of concentration of extracellular DNA. Saliva should be collected over the same amount of time, e.g., 10 min to assess saliva production. Urine with a low pH likely degrades extracellular DNA that is not protected.2. Centrifuge samples at 1,600xg for 10 min at 4^°C .Note: Centrifugation of samples should be done immediately after sample collection. Samples should not be frozen before centrifugations to prevent additional cell lysis. Processing fresh samples may lead to different isolated DNA than using stored frozen samples. Ideally, samples should be processed without freezing. When analyzin g fresh samples prolonged storage in fridge or at room temperature can also affect the DNA yield. Freezing and thawing of samples likely affects the integrity of vesicles containing DNA and complexes of extracellular DNA with proteins. In addition, samples should be warmed up to 37~^°C before isolation to decrease the viscosity and improve pipetting accuracy.3. Pipette supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube. Be careful not to take cells in the pellet at the bottom of the tube. Note: Pipetting of some types of samples can be harder after the first centrifugation. One needs to be mindful that plasma may not be completely separated, and pellet easily disturbed. Similarly, some saliva samples are more viscous than other. The issues with disturbing the pellet can be avoided by pipetting small volumes of liquid (50~mu l) and controlling the speed at which the mechanic pipette sucks up the liquid. This is especially true for low volume samples, e.g., mouse blood or saliva.4. Centrifuge samples at 16,000xg for 10 min at 4^°C . This centrifugation removes larger vesicles and apoptotic bodies from the samples.5. After the second centrifugation there should be a small pellet visible at the bottom of the tube. Be careful not to take the pellet when pipetting into the new tube. Carefully pipette the supernatant into a new tube.6. The supernatant can be used for the isolation of extracellular DNA using various commercially available kits.B. Isolation of extracellular DNA (QIAmp DNA Blood mini kit manufacturers protocol)1. Isolation is carried out according to the instructions in the protocol from the manufacturer.2. Pipette 20ul of protease at the bottom of clean tube.3. Add 200~ul of sample. The volume can be adjusted depending on the sample material.Generally, urine contains very little extracellular DNA. The volume of sample can be increased.4. Add 200ul of AL buffer.5. Pulse-vortex the samples for 15 s. Briefly centrifuge to remove droplets on the lid.6. Incubate samples at 56~^°C for 10 min. Briefly centrifuge samples again.7. Add 200ul of 96% ethanol. Pulse vortex samples for 15s .# bio-protocol8. Briefly centrifuge all samples again to remove droplets from the lids.9. Pipette sample solution into spin columns included in DNA Blood mini kit.10. Centrifuge samples at 6,000× g for 60s .11. Discard the flow through in the small reservoir below column.12. Add 500ul of AW1 solution to wash DNA bound to column.13. Centrifuge at 6,000× g for 60s . Again, discard the flow through.14. Add 500ul of AW1 solution.15. Centrifuge at maximum speed, up to 20,000× g for 3m i n .16. Discard the flow though and change the collection tube of column for a new one. Centrifuge again to remove residual wash buffers from column membrane. Note: We highly recommend the optional centrifugation (Step B16). This helps to remove remaining buffer and ethanol from the column.17. Transfer column into Eppendorf tube and add Millipore water to the column to elute the DNA. To concentrate the little extracellular DNA which is found in the samples use elution volume 50~ul to 100ul . Note: The concentration of extracellular DNA is usually very low. Contamination introduced during sample processing and DNA isolation can, thus, easily affect the outcomes. To assess potential contamination DNA should be isolated also from a negative control, e.g., millipore water as one of the samples. After the isolation there might be traces of carrier DNA even in the negative control if measured using sensitive fluorometry. PCR should not be affected by this DNA traces. To minimize contamination sources, PBS should not be added as requested in the original DNA isolation protocol if sample volume is below 200 µl.18. Centrifuge tubes with columns at 6,000× g for 60:s .19. After discarding the columns, tubes cC. Quantification of total extracellular DNA using single tubes (Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit, other fluorescence quantification options)1. Prepare the working solution and mix it with samples as stated in the protocol of the manufacturer. Working solution can be premade by the manufacturer or prepared by mixing buffer and fluorescent dye (both provided by manufacturer). This depends on the kit which is used.2. Avoid prolonged storage in light. Vortex the tubes but avoid measuring immediately after vortexing. Let the samples stand for at least one minute. Note: Samples should not be measured right after vortexing because this leads to random spikes of fluorescence. It is important to mix the tubes well and avoid droplets sticking to the lid. Droplets can be removed by gentle shaking.3. For the measurement the Qubit fluorometer or the DeNovix system can be used. Select correct settings on the reader. Select the correct kit which is used for the measurement on the reader.# bio-protocol4. Measure standards. These are usually provided by kits. One standard being negative control (buffer or distilled water) and the high standard which contains known concentration of DNA.5. Measure the fluorescence in samples and record the relative fluorescent units (RFU).6. Measure samples 3 times to avoid errors (Note a). Calculate the concentration based on a calibration curve from the raw RFU values. Recalculate the concentration of DNA in samples based on the calibration curve, the used dilution and the elution volume (Note b). Notes:a. There are rarely errors displayed by the machine measuring the concentration of DNA. However, in some cases after prolonged storage DNA in high standard provided by manufacturer may degrade. It is important to note the RFU obtained throughout the time when using the machine and kit. Similarly, blank can be contaminated when repeatedly used. This can be prevented by aliquoting the standards.b. The calibration curve is calculated in the same manner as one would calculate calibration curve for protein quantification. In this case, only two calibration points are used. Fluorescence has linear relationship with the concentration of DNA. Linear regression is used to recalculate concentration of DNA based on the RFU.7. For the determination of sensitivity of measurement please see notes below. Notes:a. Sensitivity of the kit and measurements can be tested by determining limit of detection and limit of quantification. In most of cases, these are already provided by kit manufacturer as the suggested rage where fluorescence and DNA have linear relationship. The limit of detection is calculated by multiplying standard deviation of the blank by 3, and the limit of quantification is calculated by multiplying standard deviation of the blank by 10. This also applies to testing sensitivity of measurement using plate reader (Procedure D).b. If we wanted to test it sensitivity further, we could prepare for example, five 10-fold dilution from DNA with starting concentration of 1,000 ng/ml. This would provide us with tubes with 100 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 0.1 ng/ml and 0.01 ng/ml. If we would use the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit we would be able to measure RFU higher thank blanks for first two dilutions. The dilutions of DNA with concentration 1 ng/ml, 0.1 ng/ml and 0.01 ng/ml would be at the level of blank.D. Quantification of total extracellular DNA using a plate reader1. Prepare a working solution based on the protocol of the manufacturer.2. Prepare a calibration curve from the DNA standards and first test the sensitivity of the available fluorescence plate reader as this can vary considerably from instrument to instrument. Use white or black microplates to modulate sensitivity if needed. Note: If measuring very low concentrations of extracellular DNA use a more sensitive kit that includes enhancers of fluorescence such as DeNovix ultra-high sensitivity kit or AccuBlue Highsensitivity dsDNA kit. If measuring extracellular DNA in high concentration, e.g., from saliva, the less sensitive quantification options can be used.3. Add samples to the working solution and mix by pipetting up and down several times with a multichannel pipette without forming bubbles. Note: Slow careful pippeting up and down of samples helps to ensure that bubbles will not form. Bubbles can be prevented by avoiding the pipette tip to suck up air. Reverse pipetting or ideally dispensing can be used when pipetting working solution into wells.4. Measure fluorescence using the fluorescence plate reader. The excitation wavelength is485~n m and the emission wavelength is 530~n m . Measure each plate at least three times to check the stability of the fluorescence in each well.E. Quantification of nuclear and mitochondrial extracellular DNA using real-time PCR1. Prepare PCR master mix for all planned reactions. Always include positive and negative controls. Note: The positive control is a template of either nuclear of mitochondrial DNA of known concentration. These can be obtained from isolation and PCR reaction. Concentration is determined using the fluorescence quantification methods, e.g., Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit. The serial dilutions can be prepared from the isolated sample. Purified PCR products can be sequenced to further prove the specificity and can be used as standards for the calibration curve. The resulting calibration should consist of 2-fold to 10-fold dilutions depending on the sample range which should be determined beforehand by analysing several samples. Negative control and diluent of the DNA is the molecular grade Millipore water.2. Pipette PCR master mix, primers and samples in hood to avoid contamination. Note: The PCR reaction can be decreased in volume if desired. It can be decreased in up to 15 to 10 µl. Different real-time master mixes can used for the quantification. There is need for the standardization of the assay. We have mentioned two master mixes which we have used, and they worked with this type of analysis.3. Run the real-time PCR targeting single copy genes in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Sequences of suggested primers for human extracellular DNA can be found in the materials section. Be aware of the presence of mitochondrial sequences in the nuclear DNA.4. Check the presence and absence of bands on gel electrophoresis to determine the specificity of the PCR (Note a). Troubleshooting options are discussed in Notes b and c below. Notes: a. Quantification of extracellular DNA using real-time PCR is a sensitive and powerful method. Contamination  introduced  in  the  process  of  isolation  affects  the  final  measured concentration of extracellular DNA. Ideally, all samples should be isolated at the same time with identical conditions. The real-time PCR should be done on all samples at the same time. Using triplicates can help to achieve reproducible results. b. Further troubleshooting is sometimes necessary to achieve best results. The specificity and sensitivity of reaction are crucial. Usually, there is only few copies of DNA isolated from bodyfluids. Most of the DNA is in cells or vesicles which are removed in centrifugation. The free DNA fragments are typically short. Specificity of reaction can be assessed based on melting curves from real-time PCR and from gel electrophoresis. If primer dimers are present or melting curves do not have characteristic peak, reaction need to be adjusted. This is usually done by adjusting annealing temperature.c. Sensitivity of reaction can be determined similarly as for the fluorescence measurement described in Step C7 Note b. The real-time PCR can detect DNA at low concentration, it is extremely sensitive. The detection of few copies of DNA are possible with this method.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Sample Processing\n## Sample Collection\nCollect samples for the measurement of extracellular DNA into appropriate tubes.\nCollect blood in the EDTA-containing tube (purple).\nCollect urine and saliva into sterile Falcon tubes or Eppendorf tubes.\n## Notes on Sample Collection\nThe processing of samples is important and is the main source of technical variability.\nSerum collection tubes induce blood clotting and enable the release of DNA from blood cells during the coagulation process.\nHeparin-containing tubes prevent coagulation, but do not inhibit activity of deoxyribonucleases that are likely able to cleave extracellular DNA.\nEDTA inhibits activity of deoxyribonucleases and is the preferred anticoagulant.\n## Sample Centrifugation\nCentrifuge samples at 1,600xg for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Centrifugation of samples should be done immediately after sample collection.\n## Sample Preparation\n## Supernatant Pipetting\nPipette supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube.\nBe careful not to take cells in the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n## Second Centrifugation\nCentrifuge samples at 16,000xg for 10 min at 4°C.\nThis centrifugation removes larger vesicles and apoptotic bodies from the samples.\n## Final Supernatant Pipetting\nAfter the second centrifugation, there should be a small pellet visible at the bottom of the tube.\nBe careful not to take the pellet when pipetting into the new tube.\n## Isolation of Extracellular DNA\n## QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit Protocol\nIsolation is carried out according to the instructions in the protocol from the manufacturer.\nPipette 20ul of protease at the bottom of clean tube.\nAdd 200ul of sample.\n## Sample Incubation and Centrifugation\nIncubate samples at 56°C for 10 min.\nBriefly centrifuge samples again.\nAdd 200ul of 96% ethanol.\n## DNA Binding and Washing\nPipette sample solution into spin columns included in DNA Blood mini kit.\nCentrifuge samples at 6,000×g for 60s.\nDiscard the flow through in the small reservoir below column.\n## DNA Elution\nAdd 500ul of AW1 solution to wash DNA bound to column.\nCentrifuge at 6,000×g for 60s.\nDiscard the flow through.\n## Quantification of Total Extracellular DNA\n## Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit Protocol\nPrepare the working solution and mix it with samples as stated in the protocol of the manufacturer.\nAvoid prolonged storage in light.\n## Fluorescence Measurement\nVortex the tubes but avoid measuring immediately after vortexing.\nLet the samples stand for at least one minute.\nMeasure the fluorescence in samples and record the relative fluorescent units (RFU).\n## Quantification of Total Extracellular DNA using Plate Reader\n## Working Solution Preparation\nPrepare a working solution based on the protocol of the manufacturer.\nPrepare a calibration curve from the DNA standards.\n## Sample Measurement\nAdd samples to the working solution and mix by pipetting up and down several times.\nMeasure fluorescence using the fluorescence plate reader.\n## Quantification of Nuclear and Mitochondrial Extracellular DNA\n## Real-time PCR Master Mix Preparation\nPrepare PCR master mix for all planned reactions.\nAlways include positive and negative controls.\n## Real-time PCR\nRun the real-time PCR targeting single copy genes in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.\nCheck the presence and absence of bands on gel electrophoresis to determine the specificity of the PCR.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Molecular Biology Techniques"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1417","title":"Microtubule Seeded-assembly in the Presence of Poorly Nucleating Nucleotide Analogues","text":"Microtubule Seeded-assembly in the Presence of Poorly Nucleating Nucleotide Analogues\n\n# Abstract\n\nMicrotubule dynamic instability is driven by the hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the  -subunit of the alpha- tubulin heterodimer. Nucleotide analogues are commonly used to mimic the different steps of the tubulin GTPase cycle, but most of them are poor microtubule nucleators. Usually, microtubule assembly is seeded by guanylyl-(α, β)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP) or glycerol that can be limiting factors in monitoring the effect of other nucleotide analogs on their polymerization. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the assembly of microtubules in the presence of nucleotide analogues without the need of heterogeneous seeds and at a low final glycerol concentration. Microtubules are first assembled in the presence of the analogue of interest and glycerol to promote assembly. These microtubules are then sonicated to produce seeds that will be used to assemble microtubules in the absence of glycerol. This strategy produces homogeneous nucleotide-bound microtubules that can be further analyzed by biochemical or structural methods such as cryo-electron microscopy.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Switch on the spectrophotometer and make sure that it uses the UV lamp at 350n m . Note: The default value to switch from the UV (D2) to the halogen lamp is 340 nm on the Uvikon XS. This value must be changed to, e.g., 360 nm, since the UV lamp must be used with the Ultra-Micro-cell quartz cuvettes at 350 nm.2.  Select the autorate mode at 350n m .3.  Switch on the warm water bath, set the temperature to 35^°C and let equilibrate for 15m i n . Note: The temperatures of the warm and cold circulating baths must be adjusted using a small thermocouple inside the quartz cuvette filled with water. The goal is to reach 35^°C and 4^°C for polymerization and depolymerization conditions, respectively. Variations in ambient temperature (e.g., between summer and winter) may require periodic control and adjustment of these settings. Do not exceed 35^°C during polymerization, since tubulin denaturates easily above this temperature (Weis et al., 2010).4.  Switch on the cold water bath, set the temperature to _2°_ and let equilibrate for 30 min.5.  Circulate the 35^°C fluid inside the spectrophotometer thermostated cell holder (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Temperature control of the spectrophotometer. A. Two water baths regulated at 35^°C and _2°_C are connected to the thermostated 6+6 cell changer of the spectrophotometer. Threeways valves allow rapid switch of the temperature from 35~^°C (bottom) to 4~^°C (top). The temperature of the cold water bath must be set below 4~^°C due to warming up of the fluid in the tubing system. The actual warm and cold temperatures must be checked regularly inside the cell holder using a small thermocouple. B. Warm (left) and cold (right) bather baths. C. Three-way valves. These must be switched simultaneously.B.  Microtubule seeds preparation (for 30ul )1.  Thaw rapidly between fingers a 10ul aliquot of tubulin (initial concentration 22m g/m l) and keep at 4^°C until use. Note: Tubulin was purified from porcine brains by two cycles of assembly in a high-molarity buffer (Castoldi and Popov, 2003), followed by a cycling step to obtain tubulin liganded with GDP at the E -site (Ashford et al., 1998). Cycled tubulin is commercially available, e.g., from PurSolution (https://puresoluble.com/cycled-tubulin/).Tubulin at a final concentration of 22 mg/ml was aliquoted in 100 µl and 10 µl aliquots, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 80~^°C until use. Once tubulin has been defrost, try to minimize all steps until polymerization since it will rapidly denaturates if kept in its unassembled form, even at 4^°C .2.  Add 5.5ul of the tubulin solution to 24.5ul of G-BRB80-BeF3- in a polypropylene centrifuge tube.3.  Centrifuge the tube in the Airfuge at 141, 000× g (A-110 rotor, 22 psig), 5 min, 4^°C (Figure 2). Note: The airfuge is not regulated in temperature. It must be placed in a cold room, or alternatively in a freezer such as in Figure 2. In both cases, the incoming air flow must also be cooled, otherwise the rotor will warm up (see manufacturer’s instructions if installed in a cold room).4.  Incubate the supernatant in the dry block heater, 1 h, 35^°C .5.  Sonicate the microtubules in the ultrasonic cleaner, 1 min.6.  Keep microtubule seeds at 35^°C until use in the following step.()Figure 2. Temperature control of the Airfuge. The Airfuge is maintained at 4~^°C inside a refrigerator. The incoming compressed air must also be cooled before reaching the centrifuge to avoid warming-up of the rotor during centrifugation.C.

Assembly of GDP-BeF 3^ -microtubules in the presence and absence of seeds. The OD decreases below zero after cold depolymerization of the microtubules assembled in the presence of seeds (plain line), since these latter contributed to the initial turbidity of the specimen. In the absence of seeds (dotted line), the OD remains almost stable after switching to 4~^°C . This indicates that the small increase in OD was essentially due to the formation of tubulin aggregates.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Spectrophotometer Preparation\nSwitch on the spectrophotometer and make sure that it uses the UV lamp at 350 nm.\nSelect the autorate mode at 350 nm.\n## Temperature Control\nSwitch on the warm water bath, set the temperature to 35°C and let equilibrate for 15 minutes.\nSwitch on the cold water bath, set the temperature to 4°C and let equilibrate for 30 minutes.\nCirculate the 35°C fluid inside the spectrophotometer thermostated cell holder.\n## Microtubule Seeds Preparation\nThaw rapidly a 10 ul aliquot of tubulin (initial concentration 22 mg/ml) and keep at 4°C until use.\n## Tubulin Solution Preparation\nAdd 5.5 ul of the tubulin solution to 24.5 ul of G-BRB80-BeF3- in a polypropylene centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube in the Airfuge at 141,000 x g (A-110 rotor, 22 psig), 5 minutes, 4°C.\n## Microtubule Seeds Incubation\nIncubate the supernatant in the dry block heater, 1 hour, 35°C.\nSonicate the microtubules in the ultrasonic cleaner, 1 minute.\nKeep microtubule seeds at 35°C until use.\n## Microtubule Seeded Assembly and Spectrophotometry\nThaw rapidly a 20 ul aliquot of tubulin (initial concentration 22 mg/ml).\n## Tubulin Solution Preparation\nAdd 18 ul of this tubulin solution to 82 ul of BRB80-BeF3- in a polypropylene centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube in the Airfuge at 141,000 x g (A-110 rotor, 22 psig), 5 minutes, 4°C.\n## Microtubule Assembly and Spectrophotometry\nIncubate the supernatant in the dry block heater, 5 minutes, 35°C.\nPipet 90 ul of the pre-warmed tubulin solution and add 10 ul of pre-warmed seeds.\nTransfer the mix to the quartz cuvette and place it inside the spectrophotometer.\nPress autozero and start recording at 2 points/min.\nAfter about 1 hour of polymerization, switch the fluid to the 4°C thermostated bath to induce microtubule depolymerization.\nStop recording when the OD baseline trace remains stable.\nSave data in Excel format (.xls) and plot the variation in optical density at 350 nm (∆OD 350 nm, a.u.) versus time (min) in Excel.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Biochemical & Molecular Functional Analysis"}}

Functional assays produce read outs which can be used to measure responses to selected stimuli, such as pathogen exposure, antigen loading, and cytokine stimulation. Integration of these results with high quality in vivo models allows for the development of therapeutics which target these cell populations. Current methodologies to quantify phagocytic function of monocytic cells in vitro either measure phagocytic activity of individual cells (average number of beads or particles/cell), or a population outcome % cells that contain phagocytosed material). Here we address technical challenges and shortcomings of these methods and present a protocol for collecting and analyzing data derived from a functional assay which measures phagocytic activity of macrophage and macrophage-like cells. We apply this method to two different experimental conditions, and compare to existing work flows.

For evaluation of phagocytosis, total number of cells, and number of cells with internalized beads are counted. The images are further analyzed by counting the number of beads per cell, and measuring cell area and the integrated density of sum-projected pixels from the fluorescent bead channel.

The development of new protocols towards the manipulation of biochemical processes is still a major challenge in the field of metabolic engineering. On this background, the FENIX (functional engineering of SsrA/NIa-based flux control) system allows for the post-translational regulation of protein levels, providing both independent control of the steady-state protein amounts and inducible accumulation of target proteins. This strategy enables an extra layer of control over metabolic fluxes in bacterial cell factories (see Graphical abstract below).

Rationale and construction of the FENIX system for one-step cloning and tagging of individual target proteins. The gene encoding the target polypeptide (gene of interest, goi) is amplified by PCR with specific oligonucleotides that include NheI and BsrGI restriction sites. The resulting amplicon can be directly cloned into plasmid pFENIX·gfp* (which contains a nia/ssrA tagged version of the green fluorescent protein, see Table 1 and Supplementary file) upon digestion with these two restriction enzymes. The NheI restriction site is located between the RBS and the ATG of gfp gene so the N-terminal region of goi will keep without any modification, and the Cterminal region will contain eight extra bp (in red) between goi and nia sequences, translated as XYK amino acids (X could be L, M or V amino acid depending on the last bp of the goi). After ligation, the new plasmid pFENIX·goi is transformed into competent E. coli DH10B cells. In all pFENIX plasmids, the expression of the nia/ssrA-tagged variant of the goi depends on the constitutive PtetA promoter.Table 1. Bacterial strains and plasmids()A.  Construction of pFENIX plasmids for one-step cloning and tagging of individual target proteins1.  Select the gene encoding the target polypeptide (gene of interest, goi).2.  Design specific oligonucleotides to amplify the goi, including NheI (5'-GCTAGC-3') and BsrGI (5'-TGTACA-3') restriction sites in the 5^ and 3^ termini, respectively.3.  Set up a 100-μl PCR reaction using proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). Standard reaction conditions can be used as described in the provider manual’s for Pfu DNA polymerase. In most cases, thermal cycling conditions are as follows: after heating at 98~^°C for 5 min, set 30 cycles of 98^°C for 30s (denaturation), 57^°C for 30s (annealing, temperature varies depending on the actual Tm of the oligonucleotides used), and 72~^°C for 1 min (elongation, time varies depending on the size of the goi to be amplified, typically 2 min/kb).4.  Purify the PCR product by using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit (Q-BIOgene). Note: When the PCR amplification yields non-specific bands, the target product is cut from an agarose gel after electrophoresis by loading the total volume of PCR and the amplicon is gelpurified by means of the Gene-Clean Turbo kit.5.  Digest plasmid pFENIX and the PCR product of the goi with the restriction enzymes NheI and BsrGI, and then purify both DNA fragments using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit.6.  Clone the goi in the pFENIX backbone by the T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), adding a goi concentration 5-10 times higher than the plasmid pFENIX in a final volume of 20ul .B.  Cell transformation with the pFENIX-goi plasmid1.  Keep competent E. coli DH10B cells on ice. This protocol has been carried out with strain DH10B taking into account its high competence skills, but any E. coli strain routinely used for cloning (e.g., DH5α) could be likewise used.2.  Take the 20-ul ligation mixture from the step before and add it into 0.1ml of the cell suspension of competent E . coli DH10B (see Recipes), and then incubate the mixture on ice for 30m i n .3.  Heat-shock the cells at 42^°C for 45s , and immediately add 0.9m of LB broth to the mixture.4.  Incubate 1m of the suspension of E. coli DH10B transformants at 37^°C for 60 min.5.  Spread 0.1 ml and/or the rest of the suspension of E. coli DH10B transformants onto LB agar plates with 30ugim/ml chloramphenicol, and then incubate the plates at 37~^°C overnight.6.  Isolate a transformant of E. coli DH10B harboring the cloned candidates on the LB agar with 30 ugimel/m l chloramphenicol.7.  Inoculate a single colony into 10ml of LB broth containing 30u/ml chloramphenicol in a 50mI conical tube, and incubate the culture in an orbital shaker at 37~^°C with shaking (180 rpm) overnight.8.  Isolate the plasmid from the transformant cells of 10m overnight culture by means of the HighPure plasmid isolation kit (Roche).9.  Check the DNA sequence of the tagged goi cloned into the pFENIX plasmid with an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), using the universal primers R24 ( ^5^- AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3') and F24 (5'-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3').10. Compare the sequence of the clones with that of the reference sequence to ensure the absence of mutations. An alignment software such as Bioedit or ApE-A could be used.11. Long-term storage of bacterial strains transformed with these plasmids is routinely done as 15% glycerol stocks according to well-established procedures (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).C.  Electroporation of pFENIX recombinants with the plasmid encoding the NIa protease1.  Incubate a _20-ml culture of E. coli DH10B harboring plasmid pFENIX·goi in LB medium overnight at 37^°C with shaking (180 rpm) in an orbital shaker.2.  Distribute the whole culture in a 50mI sterile conical tube and centrifuge at 2,300× g and 4^°C for 10m i n .3.  Remove supernatant, resuspend the pellet gently in 10-ml of cold sterile water (4~^°C) and centrifuge at 2,300× g and 4^°C for 10m i n .4.  Discard supernatant, add 1~ml of sterile cold water, resuspend the pellet and transfer the suspension to a _2-ml microcentrifuge tube.5.  Centrifuge at 3,800× g and 4^°C for 5 min. Repeat this step 2 times. Note: The cells are ready to be electroporated when they form a very soft and loose pellet after the centrifugation with cold water.6.  Dispose of the supernatant and add 300~ul of cold sterile water, resuspend and distribute 100ul of the resulting suspension into _2-m m gap width electroporation cuvettes.7.  Add 200 ng of the plasmid pS238·NIa to the electroporation cuvette containing 100~ul of the suspension of E. coli DH10B cells harboring the plasmid pFENIX·goi, mix gently and proceed to electroporate in an electroporator (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad). Note: The parameters of electroporation are resistance, 200 Ω; capacitance, 25mu F_ ; and voltage, 2.5k V.8.  Add 0.9 m of LB medium to the cell suspension and incubate for °leddashh at 37~^°C with shaking (180r p m) in an orbital shaker.9.  Plate the whole culture onto LB medium plates added with 30 u/m l chloramphenicol and 50u/m l kanamycin.10. Streak a few colonies and check for the presence of both plasmid pFENIX·goi and pS238·NIa in the transformant bacteria by plasmid extraction (High-Pure plasmid isolation kit, Roche).11. Digest the mixture of both plasmids extracted with SpeI ( 5^ -ACTAGT-3') and run an agarose gel electrophoresis to check the relevant sizes. Expect a band of approximately 3.6k b plus the size of the corresponding goi with pFENIX·goi, and a band of approximately 5.8~k b of the empty pS238·NIa vector.D.  Protocol for activation of the protease NIa in the FENIX native system with GFP* (Figure 2)1.  Select a single colony of the E. coli transformants harbouring the plasmids listed below (Table 1): pS238·NIa (negative control) pS341T·gfp (positive control) pSEVA238 and pFENIX·gfp* (control strain without the protease NIa) pS238·NIa and pFENIX·gfp*2.  Individually inoculate the four recombinant strains in 50mI conical tubes with 10mI of LB medium containing 30ugim/ml chloramphenicol (for the positive control), 50u/m l kanamycin (for the negative control), or both antibiotics (for strains containing both plasmids).3.  Incubate the pre-culture overnight at 37 ^°C with shaking (180r p m) .4.  Inoculate 4ul of each overnight pre-culture in a 96-well microtiter plate containing 200ul of fresh LB medium per well, including 30 u/ml chloramphenicol and/or 50 u/m l kanamycin, and in presence or absence of 1 mM 3-methylbenzoate as the inducer of nia expression (in the case of strains harbouring the pFENIX·gfp* plasmid). Each experiment should be carried out in three independent wells as technical replicates.5.  Incubate the 96-well microtiter plate at 37~^°C with shaking in a plate reader during ^24~h~ , till the stationary phase.6.  Measure the OD600 and the GFP fluorescence in the plate reader at the endpoint of the growth curve (Figure 2). GFP is excited at 488n m , the fluorescence signal is recovered at 511~n m , and it was used the bottom reading mode.()Figure 2. Performance of the FENIX system with GFP fluorescence as the readout. A. Scheme of NIa and SsrA-dependent post-translational control of GFP with the FENIX system. The gene encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP) is added with a synthetic, hybrid nia/ssrA tag, resulting in a tagged GFP variant in which the C-terminus displays the GESNVVVHQADER·AANDENYALAA  amino  acid  sequence.  The  SsrA  tag  is  directly recognized by the ClpXP and ClpAP proteases of the bacterial proteasome in vivo, thus degrading the protein. Upon action of the specific potyvirus NIa protease (the recognition site in the synthetic nia/ssrA tag is indicated with an inverted red triangle in the diagram), the SsrA tag is released and GFP can be accumulated, resulting in the appearance of G F P^+ cells. B. Evaluation of the FENIX system in recombinant E. coli using GFP protein. Plasmid pFENIX·gfp*, which contain the nia/ssrA-tagged version of GFP (indicated with blue and orange strips in the first row of the table), were transformed into E. coli DH10B carrying either plasmid pS238·NIa or the empty pSEVA238 vector (indicated as ^+ and −, respectively, in the second row of the table). The first two columns represent a negative and positive control, respectively, carried out with E. coli DH10B transformed either with the empty pFENIX vector (i.e., no GFP protein) or with a plasmid constitutively expressing the gene encoding g t p^( p S3417g t p^; Table 1). Strains indicated in the next four columns contain the nia/ssrA-tagged GFP. These experiments were done in 96-well microtiter plates containing LB medium with the necessary antibiotics and additives (1 mM 3-methylbenzoate as the inducer of nia expression, as indicated in the third row of the table), and were inoculated with a culture of the corresponding strain previously grown in LB medium with the necessary antibiotics overnight. Cells were incubated at 37~^°C with rotary agitation, and fluorescence and bacterial growth (expressed as the optical density measured at 600~n m , OD600) were recorded after ^24~h~ The specific (Sp) activity of the fluorescent proteins under study was calculated as the arbitrary fluorescence units (a.f.u.) normalized to the OD600. Each bar represents the mean value of the Sp activity ± standard deviation calculated from at least three independent experiments. The lower panel shows bacterial pellets harvested from shake-flask cultures after 24~h~ of incubation under the same growth conditions indicated for the microtiter-plate cultures as observed under blue light.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to the FENIX System\nThe FENIX system is used for one-step cloning and tagging of individual target proteins.\nThe system involves the use of a plasmid called pFENIX, which contains a nia/ssrA tagged version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP).\n## Construction of pFENIX Plasmids\nSelect the gene encoding the target polypeptide (gene of interest, goi).\n## Design of Oligonucleotides\nDesign specific oligonucleotides to amplify the goi, including NheI and BsrGI restriction sites in the 5' and 3' termini, respectively.\nThe NheI restriction site is located between the RBS and the ATG of the gfp gene, allowing for the N-terminal region of the goi to remain unmodified.\n## PCR Amplification\nSet up a 100-μl PCR reaction using proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega).\nStandard reaction conditions can be used as described in the provider manual for Pfu DNA polymerase.\nThermal cycling conditions typically involve heating at 98°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute.\n## Purification of PCR Product\nPurify the PCR product using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit (Q-BIOgene).\nIf non-specific bands are present, cut the target product from an agarose gel and gel-purify using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit.\n## Digestion and Ligation\nDigest plasmid pFENIX and the PCR product of the goi with the restriction enzymes NheI and BsrGI.\nPurify both DNA fragments using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit.\nClone the goi in the pFENIX backbone using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs).\n## Cell Transformation with the pFENIX-goi Plasmid\nKeep competent E. coli DH10B cells on ice.\nAdd the ligation mixture to the cell suspension and incubate on ice for 30 minutes.\n## Heat Shock and Incubation\nHeat-shock the cells at 42°C for 45 seconds.\nAdd LB broth to the mixture and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.\n## Selection and Verification\nSpread the cell suspension onto LB agar plates with chloramphenicol and incubate overnight.\nIsolate a transformant of E. coli DH10B harboring the cloned candidates.\nVerify the DNA sequence of the tagged goi cloned into the pFENIX plasmid using an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer.\n## Electroporation of pFENIX Recombinants with the Plasmid Encoding the NIa Protease\nIncubate a 20-ml culture of E. coli DH10B harboring plasmid pFENIX-goi in LB medium overnight.\n## Preparation of Competent Cells\nDistribute the whole culture in a 50-ml sterile conical tube and centrifuge at 2,300 × g and 4°C for 10 minutes.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend the pellet gently in cold sterile water, and centrifuge again.\n## Electroporation\nAdd 200 ng of the plasmid pS238-NIa to the electroporation cuvette containing the cell suspension.\nElectroporate in an electroporator (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) using specific parameters.\nAdd LB medium to the cell suspension and incubate at 37°C with shaking.\n## Selection and Verification\nPlate the whole culture onto LB medium plates with chloramphenicol and kanamycin.\nStreak a few colonies and check for the presence of both plasmid pFENIX-goi and pS238-NIa in the transformant bacteria.\n## Protocol for Activation of the Protease NIa in the FENIX Native System with GFP\nSelect a single colony of the E. coli transformants harboring the plasmids listed in Table 1.\n## Inoculation and Incubation\nIndividually inoculate the four recombinant strains in 50-ml conical tubes with 10 ml of LB medium containing necessary antibiotics.\nIncubate the pre-culture overnight at 37°C with shaking.\n## Measurement of OD600 and GFP Fluorescence\nInoculate 4 μl of each overnight pre-culture in a 96-well microtiter plate containing fresh LB medium per well.\nIncubate the 96-well microtiter plate at 37°C with shaking in a plate reader during 24 hours.\nMeasure the OD600 and the GFP fluorescence in the plate reader at the endpoint of the growth curve.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Synthetic Biology & Bioengineering"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1471","title":"Genomic Edition of Ashbya gossypii Using One-vector CRISPR/Cas9","text":"Genomic Edition of Ashbya gossypii Using One-vector CRISPR/Cas9\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system is a novel genetic tool which allows the precise manipulation of virtually any genomic sequence. In this protocol, we use a specific CRISPR/Cas9 system for the manipulation of Ashbya gossypii. The filamentous fungus A. gossypii is currently used for the industrial production of riboflavin (vitamina B2). In addition, A. gossypii produces other high-value compounds such as folic acid, nucleosides and biolipids. A large molecular toolbox is available for the genomic manipulation of this fungus including gene targeting methods, rapid assembly of heterologous expression modules and, recently, a one-vector CRISPR/Cas9 editing system adapted for A. gossypii that allows marker-free engineering strategies to be implemented. The CRISPR/Cas9 system comprises an RNA guided DNA endonuclease (Cas9) and a guide RNA (gRNA), which is complementary to the genomic target region. The Cas9 nuclease requires a 5^ -NGG- acute° trinucleotide, called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), to generate a double-strand break (DSB) in the genomic target, which can be repaired with a synthetic mutagenic donor DNA (dDNA) by homologous recombination (HR), thus introducing a specific designed mutation. The CRISPR/Cas9 system adapted for A. gossypii largely facilitates the genomic edition of this industrial fungus.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nNote: Materials and reagents can be purchased from different suppliers.

The design and assembly of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids has been previously described in Jiménez et al., 2019. See Figure 3A for a schematic design of the synthetic gRNA-dDNA.A. gossypii transformation. In this section, a detailed method for A. gossypii transformation is provided.Isolation and screening of engineered homokaryotic strains. The methodology for the screening of positive clones depends on the phenotype produced by the corresponding genomic edition. Phenotypes such as colored mycelia can be followed directly by visual observation (Jiménez et al., 2019). Alternatively, the genomic editions can be confirmed by analytical PCR (see Figure 3B for a typical three primer PCR strategy) using the corresponding primer pair for each modification (Jiménez et al., 2019). Figure 3. CRISPR/Cas9 design and analysis. A. Schematic design of the synthetic gRNA-dDNA.B. Analytical three primer PCR strategy.()Figure 2. Workflow of the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic edition in A. gossypii()Note: Perform all steps involving microbial culture under sterile environment in laminar airflow.A. Isolate the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid from the corresponding E . coli strain1. Inoculate the corresponding E. coli strain harboring the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid in 4~m of LB plus 50u/m l kanamycin and 100u/m l ampicillin.2. Incubate at 37^°C in a shaker incubator overnight.3. Collect the cells and extract the plasmid DNA using the FavorPrep Plasmid Extraction Mini Kit.B.  A. gossypii transformation gossyplNote: Perform Steps B8 to B20 strictly on ice.1. Inoculate 750ul of spores (approx. 10^8 spores) of the target strain of A. gossypii in a flask with 100ml of liquid MA2 medium. Note: A counting chamber such as Neubauer/Thoma can be used for calculation of spore number.2. Incubate at 28~^°C for 10-12h at 180 rpm.3. After this time, check the status of the spores under a microscope. The spores must be in a germination state called “germlings” for the optimal transformation efficiency (Figure 4A) (Jiménez et al., 2005).4. Collect the spores by vacuum filtration using a sterile paper filter. Note: Use an autoclave sterilized sentino magnetic filter funnel.5. Prepare the transformation buffer (see Recipes).6. Introduce the paper filter with the spores in a tube with transformation buffer and resuspend the spores by inversion. Note: Remove the paper filter after resuspending the spores.7. Incubate the tube with the spore suspension at 28~^°C for 30 min with agitation at 180 rpm. Note: Pre-chill liquid MA2 medium, STM buffer, electroporation cuvettes and Eppendorf tubes on ice.8. Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000× g at 4^°C .9. Carefully discard the supernatant without resuspending the spores.10. Gently wash the spores with ^20ml of ice-cold STM buffer.11. Repeat Steps B8-B10.12. Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000× g at 4^°C .13. Resuspend the spores in ^2m of ice-cold STM buffer and aliquot the spores in Eppendorf tubes.14. Centrifuge for 1 min at 17,000× g at 4^°C .15. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores to a final volume of 400ul with ice-cold STM buffer.16. Mix 190ul of the spore suspension and 5-10u of DNA (15-20 µl approx.) in an electroporation cuvette. Notes: a. Use cut pipette tips to avoid clogging of the spore suspension. b. For the negative control use the same volume of water instead of DNA.17. Use the following settings in the Gene-Pulser: 1,500 V, 200 W and 25 mF.18. Pulse the mixture and immediately add 1~ml of ice-cold MA2 medium to resuspend the spores. Transfer the spores to a new Eppendorf.20. Discard 1~ml of the supernatant and plate 200ul of the spores onto an MA2 agar plate. Note: Use a sterile glass handle to plate the spores.21. Incubate at 28~^°C for 6h for the regeneration of spores.22. After this time, the transformation plates must be covered with an upper agarose layer containing G418. Add 6~ml of 0.4% agarose, previously melted at 95~^°C and cooled to 42^°C , with 200ul of G418 at 50 u/m l (stock concentration).23. Incubate the plates at 28~^°C for 2 days.C. Isolation and screening of primary heterokaryotic transformants1. Isolate G418-resistant heterokaryotic clones from the transformation plates using fresh MA2- G418 plates (Figures 4B and 4C). Incubate the heterokaryotic transformants at 28^°C for 2 days.()Figure 4. A. gossypii germlings and transformation isolates. A. Micrograph of A. gossypii germling. B. Transformation plate. C. Isolated heterokaryotic transformants.2. Extraction of genomic DNA for analytical PCR of the heterokaryotic clones:a. Prepare DNA extraction buffer (Recipe 6).b. Pick approximately 2m m^2 of mycelia from the isolated G418-resistant heterokaryotic clones and put into 20~ul of DNA extraction buffer.c. Incubate at 100~^°C for 10m i n .d. Centrifuge for 2 min at 17,000× g .e. Keep the supernatant at 4^°C for analytical PCR. The pellet can be discarded.Notes:a. Perform a reaction for each primary heterokaryotic transformant.b. If possible, a three primer PCR (TP-PCR) strategy should be followed (Figure 3B) (Jiménez et al., 2019): design a pair of primers for the amplification of the same region in both edited and non-edited nuclei/genomes/DNAs. Additionally, design a third primer that exclusively aligns in edited genome templates for the amplification of the edited amplicon.3. Analytical PCR.a. Set up the following reaction using PCR microtubes:15ul of DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (2×)1 µl of each PCR primer ( 10uM)1~ul of the supernatant from DNA extraction (50-100n g/ul)dH2O up to 30ulb. Set up the following conditions in the thermal cycler: A denaturation step at 95^°C for 3 min 35 cycles of: Denaturation: 95~^°C for 30 s . Annealing: 50-65~^°C (adjust to the primers Tm) for _30s . Elongation: 72^°C for 1 minute (adjust to the amplicon length by 1 kb/min). Final elongation step at 72^°C for 10m i n . Store at 4^°C .4. Run a 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis with RedSafe (0.5u/ml) .a. Use 5ul of the PCR product.b. Prepare TBE 1× Buffer from TBE 20× buffer (Recipe 5).c. Expose the agarose gel under a UV transilluminator (e.g., Gel Doc EZ System, Bio-Rad).D. Sporulation of the primary heterokaryotic positives transformantsNote: The mycelium of A. gossypii is organized as multinucleated cells that are separated by septa along the hyphae. Only a limited number of nuclei within each syncytium are recipients of the transforming DNA. Sporulation of the primary heterokaryotic transformants is a required step for the isolation of homokaryotic clones, which are derived from uninucleated spores.1. Spread mycelia from the positive G418-resistant clones onto SPA plates lacking G418 and incubate at 28~^°C for 2 days. This step promotes the loss of the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid, since episomic plasmids are not fully stable in A. gossypii.2. After two days on SPA medium, confirm the presence of spores under a microscope.3. Prepare a 1 m/m zymolyase-20T buffer to isolate the spores. Sterilize by filtration through a 0.45um filter.4. Collect 1~c m^2 of mycelia and transfer into an Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of 1m g/m l of zymolyase buffer.5. Incubate at 37^°C for 50 min with gentle agitation at 850 rpm.6. After this time, check the mycelial lysis under a microscope.7. Centrifuge for 2 min at 17,000× g .8. Discard the supernatant carefully by pipetting and wash the spores with 1 ml of 0.03% Triton X100.9. Repeat Steps D7 and D8.10. Centrifuge for 2 min at 17,000× g .11. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores with 1 ml of MA2.12. Finally, make appropriate dilutions of the spore suspension and plate approx. 10^2 spores onto MA2 solid medium lacking G418. Note: Use a sterile glass handle to plate.13. Incubate at 28~^°C for 2 days.E. Isolation and screening of homokaryotic transformants:1. Isolate homokaryotic clones using fresh MA2 plates lacking G418. Incubate the homokaryotic transformants 28~~^°C for 2 days. Use MA2 plates plus G418 to confirm the loss of the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid.2. Repeat Steps C2, C3 and C4 to verify the presence of the designed mutation in the genome.3. Sequence the amplicons with appropriate primers to further confirm the presence of the desired genomic edition.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Isolation of the CRISPR/Cas9 Plasmid\nInoculate the corresponding E. coli strain harboring the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid in 4ml of LB plus 50µg/ml kanamycin and 100µg/ml ampicillin.\nIncubate at 37°C in a shaker incubator overnight.\nCollect the cells and extract the plasmid DNA using the FavorPrep Plasmid Extraction Mini Kit.\n## A. gossypii Transformation\nInoculate 750µl of spores (approx. 10^8 spores) of the target strain of A. gossypii in a flask with 100ml of liquid MA2 medium.\nIncubate at 28°C for 10-12h at 180 rpm.\n## Spore Germination and Collection\nCheck the status of the spores under a microscope.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1485","title":"Preparation of Yeast tRNA Sample for NMR Spectroscopy","text":"Preparation of Yeast tRNA Sample for NMR Spectroscopy\n\n# Abstract\n\nTransfer RNAs (tRNAs) are heavily decorated with post-transcriptional modifications during their biosynthesis. To fulfil their functions within cells, tRNAs undergo a tightly controlled biogenesis process leading to the formation of mature tRNAs. In addition, functions of tRNAs are often modulated by their modifications. Although the biological importance of post-transcriptional RNA modifications is widely appreciated, methods to directly detect their introduction during RNA biosynthesis are rare and do not easily provide information on the temporal nature of events. To obtain information on the tRNA maturation process, we have developed a methodology, using NMR as a tool to monitor tRNA maturation in a non-disruptive and continuous fashion in cellular extracts. By following the maturation of a model yeast tRNA with time-resolved NMR, we showed that modifications are introduced in a defined sequential order, and that the chronology is controlled by cross-talk between modification events. The implementation of this method requires the production for NMR spectroscopy of tRNA samples with different modification status, in order to identify the NMR signature of individual modifications. The production of tRNA samples for the analysis of modification pathways with NMR spectroscopy will be presented here and examplified on the yeast tRNAPhe, but can be extended to any other tRNA by changing the sequence of the construct.

Small scale tRNA in vitro transcription The optimal in vitro transcription conditions depend greatly on the MgCl2 and NTPs concentrations. The MgCl2/NTP ratio should be adjusted to optimize the yield of the RNA of interest (Figure 1). It is recommended to test small-scale reactions (e.g., 40 ul) before large-scale production of RNA ^15-20 m1 . In practice, the concentration of M g C l_2 is varied in small-scale reactions as described in Table 1. The yield of tRNA transcript is then analyzed by Urea-PAGE (Step A2). The conditions of Table 1 are first starting points to determine best MgCl2 concentration. Concentrations of T7 RNA polymerase, DNA template and the addition of GMP at 2-6mM can also be further optimized in a second step. a.  Prepare small scale reaction tests of 40ul as described in Table 1 in PCR microtubes. b.  Incubate the reactions in a water bath for 3h at 37~^°C . After 1 h , the appearance of a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate is the sign of a working transcription reaction. c.  Stop the reaction by adding 5ul of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 to each small scale reaction. d.  Store at -20~^°C or analyze the reactions by Urea-PAGE (Step A2).Table 1. Small scale reaction tests of 40~ul to determine best M g c l_2 concentration()2.  Transcription analysis by denaturing Urea-PAGE a.  To analyze the products of transcription, prepare a Urea-PAGE gel using the same materials as those used for protein SDS-PAGE analysis. For tRNA of 75 nts, prepare a gel mix with 7M Urea and 14% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide 19:1 by mixing 16.8~ of urea, 14ml of 40% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide 19:1, 4m of 10× TBE and adjusting the volume to 40 mI final with H_2O . (Note that this mix can be stored at room temperature for several months). Take 6ml of this mix and add 60~ul of 10% APS and 6~ul of TEMED just before placing the gel between the glass plates and put the comb immediately.b.  Take an aliquot of each small-scale reaction (typically 2.5~ul ) and add 2.5~ul of _2× RNA loading dye (Recipe 2). Load your samples in the wells and run the gel for 1 h at 200~V in 1x TBE buffer.c.  The visualization is then done by toluidine blue staining. Carefully remove the gel from the glass plates and let it stain in the toluidine-blue staining solution (Recipe 3) for 5-10~m i n . Pour the staining solution back into the stock bottle, and destain with water. Destain several times with fresh water until the background color of the gel is clear.d.  Take a picture with a regular camera. The gel corresponding to the assays described in Table 1 and revealed by toluidine-blue staining is shown in Figure 1. The best yield for the yeast tRNAPhe is obtained for conditions #5 and #6 with M g C l_2/N T P s=1.7–2.0 , i.e., M g C l_2 = 34–40m M and N T P s=20 m M . These concentrations are thus used for large-scale preparation of this tRNA.The yield of RNA produced by in vitro transcription is sometimes very sensitive to the concentration of MgCl2. We recommend to perform these small-scale assays each time that a new DNA template is used and each time new NTPs are used, indeed, best MgCl2 concentration might be slightly different with different sources of NTP. Especially, best M g C l_2 concentration might differ slightly for ^15N. -labeled nucleotides and must therefore be determined with the actual NTPs that will be used in large scale transcription reaction.()Figure 1. Sensitivity of T7 polymerase in vitro RNA production to the magnesium concentration. Urea-PAGE revealed by toluidine-blue staining showing the analysis of small-scale transcription assays of Table 1 corresponding to the production of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe. The M g C l_2 concentration is varied from 6~m M to 60~m M . Numbers above the gel correspond to the conditions #1 to #8 in Table 1.3.  Large scale in vitro transcription of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe For large scale in vitro transcription, up-scale the best conditions as determined in Step A1 with small scale reactions. In our hands, a concentrated NMR sample of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe ^15N -labeled on Us and Gs can be obtained from a 10 ml transcription reaction prepared as described below.a.  Prepare the large scale transcription reaction of 10m in a 50ml tube as follow: 40ul of DNA template pre-mixed with the T7 promotor primer at a 1:1 ratio (stock at 50uM ) 500ul of 20× T7 transcription buffer (TB). 500ul of non-labeled ATP (stock at 100m M_, ) 500ul of non-labeled CTP (stock at 100m M_, ) 500ul of ^15N -labeled UTP (stock at 100m M_. ) 500ul of ^15N -labeled GTP (stock at 100m M_, ) 1,300ul of MgCl2 (stock at 280m M_Omega ) 500ul of GMP (stock at 80m M ) 250~ul of T7 RNA polymerase (stock at 1 m g/m l_ RNase-free water to 10mb.  Incubate the reactions in a water bath for 3-4h at 37 ^°C .c.  Stop the reaction by adding 1.1.5~m of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0.d.  Store at -20^°C until purification or purify readily as described in Step A4.4.  Purification and NMR sample preparation of unmodified yeast tRNAPheThe purification is performed on a ÄKTA Purifier (or other FPLC purification system) at 4~^°C . Transcribed tRNAs are sensitive to RNases, one should therefore be careful to operate the purification in RNase free conditions. For that, wash the purification system and the columnsCopyright  2020 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.with 0.5 M NaOH and rinse them extensively with water before equilibrating the MonoQ HR 10/100 column in buffer A.a.  Filter the large scale transcription sample of Step A3 with 0.22um filters.b.  Load 5-6ml of the transcription sample on the MonoQ column previously equilibrated with buffer A. Remark: It is not recommended to load larger quantities of tRNAs onto the column. The purification indeed becomes difficult due to a broadening of the elution peaks. Perform Steps A4b to A4d as many times as needed for large scale transcriptions of more than 5m.c.  The purification of the tRNA transcript is achieved using a gradient from 20% to 80% of buffer B with a length of 10 column volumes (CV) and a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Collect 1~ml fractions. Transcribed yeast tRNAPhe is usually eluted between 50% and 55% of buffer B.d.  Analyse the content of the fractions with denaturing Urea-PAGE as described in Step A2, and pool the fractions containing the tRNA of interest (usually 5 fractions of 1~m ). Do not add fractions of tRNAPhe eluted after 55% of buffer B, since they usually contain longer RNA transcripts originating from non-templated nucleotide addition at the z^ -end of the transcript.e.  Dialyze extensively the pooled fractions of yeast tRNAPhe in a dialysis sack against 1 mM Na-phosphate p H6.5 . For that one usually dialyzes the sample against a ^2~L~ dialysis solution for at least ^2h and changes it with a fresh solution 3 times.f.  Recover the dialyzed tRNAPhe in a 50ml plastic tube and refold it by heating the sample at 95^°C for 5 min and letting it cool down slowly at room temperature.g.  Add concentrated buffer stock solutions (e.g., 0.5 M Na-phosphate p H6.5 and 1 M MgCl2) to place the refolded sample in the final NMR buffer (i.e., 10~m M Na-phosphate p H6.5 , 10 mM MgCl2).h.  Concentrate the unmodified yeast tRNAPhe sample in the NMR buffer to 1.5-2.0 mM using Amicon 3,000 MWCO. In our hands, with a 10ml transcription with ^15N -labeled on Us and Gs, one usually obtains a final NMR sample of 300ul at 1.8m M (i.e., 0.5-0.6 µmol).i.  Store the sample at -20~^°C or use it directly for NMR spectra measurements (see Note 2).B  Production of modified yeast tRNAPhe by in vivo recombinant expression in E. coli1.  Modified yeast tRNAPhe recombinant expression and extraction a.  Transformation of E. coli with the tRNA expression plasmid and ^15N -labeled expression The volumes and quantities mentioned below refer to a 1 L culture. We recommend to grow several liters of culture (i.e., 2-4 L) to increase the quantity of modified yeast tRNAPhe purified following this protocol. We also recommend to grow 500~m of culture in 2 L flasks to get enough oxygenation or ideally to use a fermenter to optimize certain parameters (e.g., pH of the medium, oxygenation…).i.  Use a 100ul aliquot of electrocompetent E. coli JM101Tr strain. Add 2ul of the plasmid (at 50200n g/ul) .ii.  Put the mix in an electroporation cuvette. Electroporate the cells, with the machine set according to the electroporation cuvette and organism that is used (namely set the electroporator to “Ec2” meaning x . coli 0.2 cm cuvette”). Then add 1~ml of LB medium and incubate for 30m i n at 37^°C .iii.  Divide the 1.1ml of transformation product in two and pour each half directly into a 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 0.5~L of ^15N -labeled rich growth media (i.e. Spectra 9) supplemented with 0.5 of ^15N -labeled celtone base powder and 50 u/ml of ampicillin (total culture volume of 1 L).iv.  Grow the bacteria for 20h at 37^°C .v.  Recover the bacteria by centrifugation at 5,000× g for 20m i n .Total small RNAs extractioni.  Resuspend the pellets with 10m of extraction buffer in a 50ml conical tube.ii.  Add 10m of water-saturated phenol. Mix gently for 1h at room temperature on a tube rotator.iii.  Centrifuge at 8,000×g for 30 min at 20~^°C . Carefully recover the aqueous phase, which corresponds to the upper phase lying above the phenol phase.iv.  Do a counter-extraction with the addition of 1 m of extraction buffer to the phenol phase. Mix gently for 15min , centrifuge at 8,000× g for 30m i n at ^20^°C , and carefully recover the aqueous phase.v.  Add 0.1 volume of 5 M NaCl and 2 volumes of ethanol absolute to the pooled aqueous phases of Steps B1biii and B1biv.vi.  Vortex vigourously and then centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 20 min at 4~^°C . Discard the supernatant.vii. Resuspend the pellet in 5ml of 1 M NaCl. Centrifuge at 8,000× g for 30m i n at 4^°C .viii. Recover the supernatant, and add 2.5 volume of ethanol absolute.ix.  Centrifuge again 30 min at 8,000× g at 4^°C . All the small RNAs are now precipitated. Discard the supernatant.x.  Resuspend the pellet in ^2 ml of 2 M Tris-HCl p H 8.0 and incubate 3h at 37~^°C to completely deacylate the z^ extremity of the tRNAs.xi.  Precipitate the deacylated RNAs by adding 2 volumes of ethanol absolute, vortex vigourously and centrifuge at 8,000× g for 30m i n at 4^°C .xii. Dissolve the pellet in 5m of purification buffer C. The sample is ready for the purification step (Step B2).2.  Modified yeast tRNAPhe purification and NMR sample preparation a.  Before starting the purification, wash the purification system, the loops and the columns with 0.5 M NaOH and rinse them extensively with water in order to work in RNase free conditions.b.  Gel-filtration chromatographyi. Load the 5~m sample (obtained at the end of Step B1) at 0.5ml/min on a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 75 pg column previously equilibrated with purification buffer C. ii.  Elute at 0.5ml/min , collect 3.5ml per fraction.Gel-shift assay to identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPhei.  Design a DNA oligonucleotide sequence that is specifically complementary to the overexpressed yeast tRNAPhe and not conserved in the other E. coli tRNAs. In our hands, it works well when the complementary DNA oligonucleotide includes the anticodon arm and parts of the D- and TC -arms (see Figure 2A).ii.  In 0.2 ml. -microtubes, mix 5~ul of each fraction with 1~ul of the complementary DNA oligonucleotide (stock at 100uM_s ), or with 1~ul of water (negative control).iii.  Heat the samples at 95^°C for 2 min in a dry bath incubator, and cool them down on ice.iv.  Add 6ul of the _2× Laemmli loading buffer to the samples.v.  Prepare a 14% SDS polyacrylamide gel: For the separating gel, mix 1.75~m of 40% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (19:1) solution, 1.875ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 25ul of 20% (w/v) SDS and adjust to 5m with water. Add 40ul of 10% APS and 5ul of TEMED just before pouring the gel between the glass plates at ^2/3 of the total height. For the stacking gel, mix 500~ul of 40% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (19:1) solution, 630~ul of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 50 μl of 20% (w/v) SDS and adjust to 5m with water. Add 40ul of 10% APS and 5~ul of TEMED just before pouring the gel on top of the polymerized separating gel. Put immediately the 10-well comb.vi.  Load the samples on the 14% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Migrate in 1x TGS buffer at 200V for 1 h 30 min .vii. Visualize the RNAs in the fractions with the toluidine-blue staining (as described in Step A2c). Fractions containing the tRNA of interest can be easily identified with the appearance of an additionnal band at higher molecular weight in the presence of the complementary DNA oligonucleotide (Figure 2B).d.  Ion exchange chromatographyi.  Pool the fractions from Step B2b. that contain the yeast tRNAPhe as identified in Step B2c.ii.

Identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPhe with a gel-shift assay as described in Step B2c and pool the fractions of interest.()()Figure 2.

Hydrophobic interaction chromatographyi.  Add ammonium sulfate to the pooled fractions of Step B2d to reach a final concentration of 1.7M . Dissolve the salt by vortexing.ii.  Load this sample at 0.5ml/min on a Phenyl superose HR 10/10 column previously equilibrated with purification buffer E.iii.  Apply a gradient from 20% to 45% of buffer C over 15 CV at 0.5ml/min . Collect fractions of 2.5ml .iv.  Identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPhe with a gel-shift assay as described in Step B2c and pool the fractions of interest.f.  Desalting the sample Desalt the sample with a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column previously equilibrated with the NMR buffer or dialyze the sample extensively against the NMR buffer. For that, one usually dialyzes the sample against a 2 L dialysis solution for at least ^2h and changes it with a fresh solution 3 times.g.  Sample concentration Concentrate the modified yeast tRNAPhe sample in the NMR buffer to 0.2–0.5 mM using Amicon 3,000 MWCO. In our hands, with a ^2~L~ culture in ^15N. -labeled rich media, one usually obtains a final NMR sample of 250~ul at 0.4m M (i.e., 0.08–0.12umol_.^. .h.  Store the sample at -20~^°C or use it directly for NMR spectra measurements (see Note 2).# Notes1.  The cloning step is not described in the present protocol since the approach and the protocol have been previously detailed in Dégut et al. (2016). Briefly, five DNA oligonucleotides are designed to create after a phosphorylation and a hybridization step a DNA insert which corresponds to the yeast tRNA gene flanked by overhangs corresponding to EcoRI and PstI restriction sequences at the 5^ and z^ -ends, respectively (see Figure 3). The pBSTNAV vector is  linearized  with  EcoRI  and  PstI  and  classical  ligation  protocol  is  performed.  A counter-selection step with SmaI can be performed to increase the number of positive clones bearing the yeast tRNAPhe gene as described in Dégut et al. (2016). Positive clones are checked by sequencing.Oligonucleotides for yeast tRNAPhe gene cloning in pBSTNAV: oligo #1: 5^ AATTCGCGGATTTAGCTCAGTTGGGAGAG 3′ oligo #2: 5′ CGCCAGACTGAAGATCTGGAGGTCCTG 3′ oligo #3: 5′ TGTTCGATCCACAGAATTCGCACCACTGCA 3′ oligo #4: 5′ GTGGTGCGAATTCTGTGGATCGAACACAGGACCTCCAGA 3′ oligo #5: 5′ TCTTCAGTCTGGCGCTCTCCCAACTGAGCTAAATCCGCG 3′()Figure 3. Schematic representation of the cloning region of pBSTNAV vector and sequence coding for the yeast tRNAPhe inserted between the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. In pBSTNAV, the strong constitutive lpp promoter upstream of the tRNA gene leads to high levels of recombinant transcripts production. The five oligos used to generate the yeast tRNAPhe coding sequence (oligos #1-#5) are labeled on the figure and displayed with different colors for clarity.2.  For the yeast tRNAPhe samples produced as described in the current protocol, we measured NMR spectra on Bruker AVIII-HD 600 MHz and AVIII-HD 700 MHz (equipped with TCI 5-mm cryoprobes) with 5-mm Shigemi tubes. Measurements were conducted at 38~^°C in the NMR buffer (10 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 5% (v/v) D_2O .

The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment. We generated Drosophila models of IBMPFD in adult flight muscle in vivo. Here we describe a variety of assays to characterize disease pathology and dissect disease mechanism, and the consequences of in vivo feeding of VCP inhibitors.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Fix the thoraces in 4% paraformaldehyde/Schneider’s Buffer for 45 min at room temperature in either a microcentrifuge tube or PCR tube.3. Transfer the post-fix thoraces into a dissection dish containing 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Triton X-100 helps to break the surface tension over the cuticles and facilitates muscle piece dissection in the following steps.4. Indirect flight muscles (IFM, indicated by red arrows in Figures 1A and 1B) are located in the middle of the thoraces. IFMs can be dissected out using either 30-gauge needles or tweezers. Use needles or tweezer to gently open up the thorax from either the dorsal or ventral midline and expose the IFM. The IFMs are two large groups of muscles that run anterior-posterior in themiddle of the thorax (Figure 1C). Each group of IFMs contains 5 large muscles that lie parallel to each other and are located at the dorsal surface of the half-dissected thorax. Carefully isolate each muscle by cutting at the ends that attach the muscle to the cuticle. One well-fixed wildtype thorax can generate 5-10 fragments of intact muscle (Figure 1C). Flies that carry an IFM targeted GFP marker can be used to further confirm that the correct muscle has been dissected (Figure 1C).()Figure 1. Indirect Flight Muscle (IFM) Dissection. A. The location of IFM in intact thorax (red arrows). B. The sagittal plane of a fixed thorax, red arrow indicating where the IFM are located. C. Dissected muscle pieces in the dissection dish. The genotype of the flies used is IFMGal4>UASt-mitoGFP. Scale bar: 0.5:m m .B. In situ cell death detection/TUNEL Assay for IBMPFD flies1. Fix the thoraces and dissect the IFMs from WT, VCP WT, RH and AE flies as described above and collect into PCR tubes.2. Introduce TUNEL Blocking buffer into the tubes containing muscle for 30 min. The TUNEL Blocking buffer contains 0.2% Triton X-100 that permeabilizes and blocks the muscle sample at the same time.3. Add TUNEL Enzyme (4ul) and 10x Reaction Buffer (36u//) from the in-situ Cell Death Detection Kit and incubate for ^2-3h at 37^°C in a water bath. Use a pipette to gently mix the sample every 30min .4. Wash the samples with PBS twice.5. Replace PBS with Fluoromount-G mounting solution. Mount IFMs on a microscopic slide using either a glass pipette or 200ul pipette tip and visualize the muscle with a confocal microscopeusing an excitation wavelength of 546 nm. In 6 days old flies, VCP RH and AE expression leads to significant cell death (Zhang et al., 2017). This is observed as extensive red nuclear staining.C. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy imaging1. Dissect the fixed muscle as described above. Then wash with PBS and permeabilize muscles with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 3-4h on the rocker at room temperature followed by 5 min wash with 1x PBS.2. For myofibril staining, add Rhodamine Phalloidin (1:500 dilution) and stain for ^2~h~ at room temperature or 4^°C overnight.3. For immunofluorescence staining, fixed muscle fragments are incubated with primary antibody diluted to the desired concentration (1:100 or 1:200) in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS at 4^°C overnight. We used anti-TARTAR Binding Protein or anti-TDP43 at a concentration of 1:100.4. Wash 3× each for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS.5. Incubate muscle fragments with a goat anti-rabbit/mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 secondary antibody (1:200 in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS) for ^zh at room temperature or 4^°C overnight.6. Wash three times (10 min each time) with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and mount samples on a microscope slide with Fluoromount-G. Samples are visualized under a confocal microscope with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm or 546 nm corresponding to the secondary antibodies. In 6- day old flies, TDP43 localizes both in the nucleus and sarcoplasmic/cytosolic area of the IFM in wildtype flies; the nucleus localization pattern is lost and more aggregates are observed in the sarcoplasmic/cytosolic region in VCP RH and AE mutants (Zhang et al., 2017).D. Protein lysates and Western blot1. Anesthetize flies with C O_2 , isolate thoraces as above, and put them in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. Note: The thorax is not fixed.2. Add RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, 10-15ul for each thorax, 5-10 thoraces for each genotype.3. Homogenize the thoraces in the lysis buffer with prechilled the polypropylene pellet pestles 5-6 times, followed by spinning the pestle with the mortar at the highest speed for 10-15 s. Incubate lysate on ice for 30 min to fully lyse the tissue.4. Centrifuge protein lysates at 10,000xg for 15 m i n and transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.5. Boil the supernatant with 6× SDS sample buffer with  -mercaptoethanol at 95^°C for 5 min.6. Load proteins and let them separate in 8% SDS-PAGE Gels in Tris/SDS running buffer and run it at 80 volts.7. Transfer proteins to PVDF membrane for ^zh in Tris/Glycine Buffer with 15% methanol.8. Incubate transfer membrane with 3% BSA/PBS for 1~h~ .9. Incubate the membrane with primary antibody diluted in 1% B S A/0.01% Tween-PBS at 4^°C overnight.10. Wash the membrane in 0.01% Tween-PBS for three times (10 min each) and incubate with antimouse/rabbit IgG HRP linked secondary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk /0.01% TweenPBS for ^2h at room temperature.11. Develop the membrane with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate Kit. We expressed VCP WT, VCP RH and AE at comparable levels in the thoraces (Zhang et al., 2017).E. Toluidine blue staining and electronic microscopy for IBMPFD flies# Fixation and EmbeddingNote: Perform Step E4 and subsequent steps in a safety fume hood.1. Anesthetize flies and cut the thoraces, quickly dip in 95% ethanol (this helps to break the surface tension so as to facilitate subsequent immersion in the EM fixative buffer). Then transfer thoraces to 0.5ml ice-old EM Fixative Buffer (below) in a microcentrifuge tube.2. Fix for a minimum of 2 h on ice with rocking. If fixation is carried out for longer or the protocol needs to be paused, samples may be left in fixative after the ^2h time point and placed at 4^°C overnight or until ready to proceed. Thoraces will sink to the bottom of microcentrifuge tube.3. Rinse each sample with 0.1 M phosphate buffer for three times (10 min each time) at room temperature. Note: All subsequent steps should be carried out in a Bio-safety hood.4. Post-Fix samples in 1%0s0_4 in ddH2O (freshly prepared) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples should not be fixed with O s O4 for more than ^zh or the samples will become brittle.5. Rinse sample with ddH I_2O for three times (10 min each) at room temperature.6. Dehydrate samples in 70% and 95% ethanol for 5 min each at room temperature.7. Dehydrate samples in 100% ethanol twice (10 min each) at room temperature.8. Dehydrate samples in 100% propylene oxide twice (7 min each) at room temperature.9. Infiltrate samples in 1:1 mixture of 100% propylene oxide and Epon mix for 30 min at room temperature.10. Incubate samples in 100% Epon Mix ( 1.5% BDMA added) overnight at room temperature.11. Introduce samples in 100% Epon Mix ( 1.5% BDMA added) into an embedding mold. In the bottom right of each well, put a piece of paper with sample name/number (Figure 2A).12. Polymerize Epon at 60-70~^°C overnight.()Figure 2. Drosophila thorax embedding and section position. A. Two individual samples embedded and blocked with labels. B. Properly embedded fly thorax (red arrow) in the Epon Resin. The sagittal plane of the thorax (white dotted lines) should be parallel to the edge of the resin block so as to facilitate the section. C. A well-trimmed resin block with a thorax sample after thick section. Glass knife or Diamond knife blades should run parallel to the sagittal plane of the thorax. Scale bar: 1 mm.# Sectioning and Staining1. Toluidine Blue Staininga. Well-embedded thorax samples are positioned in the resin block as shown (Figure 2B). The sagittal midline of the thorax is parallel to the edge of the resin block.b. Use a razor blade to cut away the Epon around the sample as much as possible (Figure 2C). Decreasing the section surface will increase the section quality.c. Cut thick sections (1.5-2 um) for Toluidine Blue staining and to determine the area within which thin sections will be taken for electron microscopy imaging. i. Use a microtome with glass knife to cut thick sections. Transfer sections to water drops on the glass slide using a toothpick. ii. Evaporate the water by putting the slide on a 70~^°C heat block. This will flatten the section samples. iii. Apply 1% Toluidine Blue to fully cover the section sample area and put the slide on the 70~^°C heat block until the edge of the Toluidine Blue liquid starts to dry (2-5 min). Do not over dry the Toluidine Blue solution or the section will become contaminated by the dry solute in the staining buffer, which results in degradation of image quality. iv. Rinse the slide in ddH2O until non-bound stain is removed. v . Let the section dry completely before applying the Permount mounting solution.d. A well-aligned thick section sample of a wildtype thorax is shown in Figure 3A (Indirect flight muscle pieces can be easily observed). Higher magnification images of the tissue samples can be utilized (Figure 3B) to assay muscle tissue integrity. In 6-day old flies, VCP RH and AE expressing flies have disrupted muscle tissue integrity as compared to WT and VCP WT controls (Zhang et al., 2017).()Toluidine BlueEMFigure 3.

Mitochondrial size quantification using ImageJ. Scale bar: 1~um (119 pixels). Cross-section area of selected mitochondrion is 2.92um^2 (Red square).# 2. Electronic microscopy sample preparationa. Select well-aligned samples from the Toluidine Blue staining to be used in thin sectioning (80-90 nm).i. Use a microtome with a Diamond knife (with sterilized ddH2O) to cut thin sections. The sections should appear silver to gold color.ii. Use a fine needle to position 1-4 sections in a line on the water surface for grid mounting.iii. Pick up an empty slot grid that is not coated with formvar with tweezers. Gently touch the grid to sections floating on the surface. The sections will attach to the middle of the slot within the water drop.iv. Use a pair of self-closing tweezers to hold a new formvar-sealed slot grid or mesh grid with the shiny-side up. Place the section-attached slot grid onto the shiny side of the new formvar grid.v. Remove the water drop between two grids by placing the sharp corner of a triangleshaped filter paper at the edge between the grids. Sections will attach to the formvarsealed new grids and flatten.vi. Remove the empty grid and reuse it to pick up additional sections. The section-attached grid can be stored in the grid box for further staining as described below.b. Prepare the uranium acetate (UA) solution and filter through a 0.22um filter system. Float the section side of the grid on the UA solution for 15min at room temperature. Wash the grid five times (1 min each) in a ddH2O water drop or three times (1 min each) in 3 separate beakers containing ddH2O.c. Put the grid section with shiny side down on a drop of the lead citrate solution and stain for 5-10 min at room temperature. Wear a mask to prevent breathing on to the sections as excess C O_2 will affect staining quality. Keep the staining dishes covered with the plastic cover that comes with the staining dish.d. Wash the grid with ddH2O as above.e. Transfer the stained grid to the grid box for further imaging.f. Figure 3C shows an image of wildtype muscle visualized using TEM at 10,000× . In 6-day old flies, VCP RH and AE expressing flies display disrupted actin and mitochondrial structure as compared with wildtype and VCP WT flies (Zhang et al., 2017).3. Mitochondrial cross-section size quantificationa. Import an ultrastructural electron microscopy image (10,000x magnification) into ImageJ Software (National Institute of Health), Figure 3D.b. After setting the scale (analyze textgreater set scale: 119 pixels =~1~um; , using Polygon selection (Yellow line) trace out each mitochondrion on the image and measure its area (analyze > measure), Figure 3D. All the mitochondria on the image are individually measured.c. At least three images are analyzed for each thorax and 3 thoraxes of each genotype were examined.d. An independent Student’s t-test is used to test for statistical significance between different genotypes.F. In vivo VCP inhibitor treatment1. Dissolve powdered forms of NMS-873 ( 19.2m M , stock concentration) and ML240 (25.2 m M , stock concentration) in DMSO as stocks.2. Dilute Stock solution in ethanol/ddH2O ( 100~ul Ethanol ^+ -~600~ul ddH2O) to the desired concentration. Ethanol can help keep the compound in solution. Heat Drosophila food in a microwave for 20 s until it fully melts, and then let it cool down to <50~^°C . Add the chemical in DMSO/ethanol H_2O to the food along with 10ul of food dye per 4ml of fly food, and hand-mix it until the color appears homogenous. Vials with cotton plugs can be dried at room temperature if food seems wet. DMSO/ethanol in comparable amounts is used as a vehicle control.3. Put Drosophila parents of desired genotypes in food containing DMSO/ethanol or inhibitors for 3 days to lay eggs and then remove them. Progeny growth then occurs in the presence of vehicle control or test compound.4. Immediately after eclosion of adults (hatch from their pupal case), transfer these adults to freshly prepared food containing the same concentration of DMSO or inhibitor, and feed the flies for the desired number of days before assaying them.5. VCP inhibitors feeding significantly reversed the muscle disintegration, muscle cell death and ultrastructural mitochondrial defects in VCP RH and AE flies (Zhang et al., 2017).# Recipes1.

PCC 6803 Using FLAG-affinity Chromatography","text":"Purification of Protein-complexes from the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Using FLAG-affinity Chromatography\n\n# Abstract\n\nExploring the structure and function of protein complexes requires their isolation in the native state–a task that is made challenging when studying labile and/or low abundant complexes. The difficulties in preparing membrane-protein complexes are especially notorious. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a widely used model organism for the physiology of oxygenic phototrophs, and the biogenesis of membrane-bound photosynthetic complexes has traditionally been studied using this cyanobacterium. In a typical approach, the protein complexes are purified with a combination of His-affinity chromatography and a size-based fractionation method such as gradient ultracentrifugation and/or native electrophoresis. However, His-affinity purification harbors prominent contaminants and the levels of many proteins are too low for a feasible multi-step purification. Here, we have developed a purification method for the isolation of z x FLAG-tagged proteins from the membrane and soluble fractions of Synechocystis. Soluble proteins or solubilized thylakoids are subjected to a single affinity purification step that utilizes the highly specific binding of FLAG-affinity resin. After an intensive wash, the captured proteins are released from the resin under native conditions using an excess of synthetic z x FLAG peptide. The protocol allows fast isolation of low abundant protein complexes with a superb purity.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Cell culture and harvesting1. Working in a laminar flow hood, inoculate Synechocystis cells using a metallic inoculation loop into five, 500~ml Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 200~m BG-11 medium. Grow the cells at 28~^°C and 40 um o l/m^2/s photosynthetic photon flux density on a rotary shaker set to 150 rpm until the culture reaches mid/end of logarithmic growth phase. Note: When the optical density of the culture at 750 nm reaches 0.6-0.8, which corresponds to 9-12×10^7 Synechocystis cells/ml.2. Collect your cultures (O D_7500.8) into a 10 L flask and dilute it to 4k final volume to gain O D_750 0.2 density. Grow the culture until mid/end of logarithmic growth phase with magnetic stirrer (240 rpm) and air bubbling in the same conditions as above.3. Divide the cell culture into 500ml centrifuge bottles and pellet the cells by centrifuging at 10,000 xg in a cooling centrifuge (Sigma 8KS, rotor 12505-H) at 4^°C for 20m i n .4. Suspend the cell pellets into a total of 30ml of MES buffer.Notes:a. All media and equipment used for the preparation of the cell culture should be sterilized. Use the gas burner to sterilize the metal inoculation loop, and autoclave all glassware and growth media prior to use.b. Cyanobacterial cultures have negligible absorbance at 750 nm; therefore, the OD at this wavelength is primarily dependent on light scattering (turbidity). Different spectrophotometers differ greatly in their various optical properties, and hence the light scattering value by O D_750 may vary. Therefore, it is important to establish the OD at which your culture is at the mid/end of logarithmic growth phase by measuring a growth curve a priori. Under our standard conditions, the doubling time of Synechocystis is approximately 12h_: ; hence, a culture with O D_750=0.2 will reach desirable OD750 in about a day.c. In our experience, larger volumes of cyanobacterial cultures (i.e., 4 L) tend to grow slower, probably due to limitations in gas exchange. Therefore, an intensive bubbling of the culture by air is desirable.d. At Step A4 you may freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen and store them at -8O~^°C until use.B. Cell lysis and thylakoid isolation1. Pellet the cells in 80ml centrifuge tubes at 10,000× g (Sigma 3K30, rotor 12155-H) at 4^°C for10 min.2. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells into 5ml of MES buffer using a wet paint brush. Add 30m MES buffer to the centrifuge tube and pellet the cells as above.3. Resuspend the cells into 12~m of MES buffer and add protease inhibitor: dissolve 1 tablet into 1 ml of deionized water to obtain a 50× stock solution and pipet accordingly to obtain 1x working concentration. You may store the rest of the inhibitor at -20~^°C for later use.4. Add 3 ml of glass beads and 3ml of cell suspension into four 7ml screw cap vials (Figure 1A), close the lids and seal them with parafilm (Figure 1B). There should be approximately 1 cm of free space in the tube, you may add some buffer to reach the desired volume.5. Break the cells for 60~s by Mini-Beadbeater-16. Allow the tubes to cool on ice protected from light for 5 min and repeat the breaking cycle 5 times.6. After lysis, spin down the beads at 500xg for ^10s at 4^°C , (Sigma 3K30, rotor 12155-H equipped with adapters for 15~ml conical tubes). Collect the supernatants into a ^27m centrifuge tube. Wash the beads (Figure 1C) with one bed volume of MES buffer three-to-four times, until the supernatant and the beads appear light green (Figures 1D-1E).7. Pool all supernatants from Step B6 and pellet the thylakoids by centrifuging at 35,000xg (Sigma 3K30, rotor 12158-H) at 4^°C for 20m i n .8. At this point, if you are only interested in the isolation of membrane proteins, you may discard the supernatant. Otherwise, collect the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube (marked: SP, ‘soluble proteins’), and resuspend the pellet into 10~ml of MES buffer using a wet paint brush (mark the tube: TM, ‘thylakoid membranes’). Centrifuge the tubes as above.9. Collect the supernatant from the ‘SP’-tube into a 50ml conical tube and store it on ice. Discard the supernatants from the ‘TM’-tube and resuspend the pellets from both tubes (‘SP’ and ‘TM’) into 1/3 of soluble fraction volume of MES buffer. If you are continuing only with the membrane fraction use a total of 10ml MES buffer and combine the pellets into a 50ml conical tube.10. Freeze a 300~ul aliquot of soluble proteins and a 100~ul aliquot of thylakoids in liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C for further analysis by gel electrophoresis.Notes:a. After pelleting the cells, the supernatant may appear slightly bluish due to partial breaking of cells after freezing and thawing.b. From Step B5 onwards it is important to keep the sample cooled (4-10~^°C) and protect it from light to prevent the excitation of chlorophyll molecules and the consequent formation of reactive oxygen species. We recommend working under dim green light.c. Thylakoids are easier to resuspend first into few ml volume, before adding the rest of the buffer.d. At Step B10 you may also freeze the rest of the soluble protein and thylakoid samples in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80~^°C until subsequent solubilization and purification.()Figure 1. Breaking of Synechocystis cells. A. Screwcap tubes are filled with _3ml of glass beads and 3ml of cyanobacterial suspension; B. The tubes are sealed with parafilm and cells lysed using a bead beater. C. After breaking cells, the beads are spun to the bottom and the supernatant is collected. D. The beads are washed with MES buffer; E. After each washing step, the supernatant is collected.C. Thylakoid solubilization1. Adjust the chlorophyll concentration of the thylakoids to 0.5u/ul with MES buffer.2. Add 1% n-dodecyl  -D-maltoside (DDM) to the thylakoid suspension and incubate the tube for 1h at 10~^° in the dark (for example, you may cover the tube with aluminum foil) on a rotator mixer set to 10r p m .3. Transfer the suspension into a ^27m centrifuge tube and pellet insoluble material at 46,000× g (Sigma 3K30, rotor 12158-H) at 4^°C for 30m i n .4. Collect the supernatant into a 50ml conical tube and discard the pellet.5. Freeze 100~ul of the solubilized thylakoids in liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C for further analysis, particularly for the identification of a potential problem with protein solubility.D. FLAG-affinity purification1. Wash the purification column with 1ml of RO-water followed by 1 ml of deionized water. 2. Close the column, then add 1~m of MES buffer and 600ul of 1:1 Anti-FLAG-M2 agarose resin using a cut pipette tip (Video 1).()Video 1. Column preparing3. Open the column and allow the buffer to flow through. Wash the resin with an additional 1 ml of MES buffer (pipet the buffer gently on top of the resin and allow it to flow through; Figure 2A; Video 2).()Video 2. Gentle washing of column4. Load the protein suspension into the column and collect the flowthrough into a glass beaker (Figure 2B; Video 3).()Video 3. Sample loading5. Wash the column with 1 ml of MES buffer. Discard the flowthrough.6. Load the flowthrough from Step D4 to the column for the second time and collect the flowthrough. Repeat the binding once more.7. Take a 0.5m sample from the final flowthrough, freeze it in liquid nitrogen and store at -80~^°C for further analysis Figure 3, flowthrough (FT).8. Wash the column with 1 ml of MES buffer Figure 2C; Figure 3, first wash (W1).9. Close the column and add 1 ml of MES buffer: pipet the buffer with high enough speed to mix it thoroughly with the resin (Figure 2D; Video 4) (you may mix the buffer with the resin gently by pipetting up and down with a cut pipette tip, but some resin may stick to the tip and be lost). Open the column and allow the buffer to drain out Figure 3, second wash (W2).()Video 4. Vigorous washing of the resin10. Wash the column with 1 ml of MES buffer without mixing the resin. Repeat this washing step 3 times. In total, the resin is washed by 20 column volumes of MES buffer (Figure 2E).()Figure 2. Isolation of 3x FLAG-tagged proteins from Synechocystis using affinity chromatography. Individual purification steps for soluble proteins and detergent-solubilized membrane proteins are shown in upper panels and lower panels, respectively. A. Anti-FLAG resin is packed into a plastic chromatography column. B. Soluble protein fraction (upper panel) or detergent solubilized thylakoids (lower panel) are loaded to the column. C. Sample is allowed to flow through the column and the flowthrough is collected. Loading can be repeated several times. D. First wash (W1) is performed by gently pipetting buffer on top of the resin. E. Washing is continued as in panel D until the column is completely washed from excess pigment-proteins. FLAG resin is indicated with a black bar in panels A and E.11. Resuspend the resin into one bed volume of MES buffer and transfer it into a Proteus Clarification Mini Spin Column.12. Add z x FLAG-peptide into a final concentration of 300 u g/m l . Seal the top of the tube with parafilm and cover the whole tube with aluminum foil. Mix in a rotator mixer set to 10 rpm for 30 min at 10~^°C .13. Spin the column at 600× g (Eppendorf 5415 R) at 4^°C for 3 min. Collect elution 1 into a 1.5ml microtube and store on ice.14. Repeat the incubation with FLAG-peptide and centrifuge as above to yield elution 2.15. The obtained elutions can be pooled and the total elution volume (typically 800~ul) can be immediately concentrated using microconcetrators (e.g., Amicon Ultra-0.5, Sigma-Aldrich) with a desired cut-off to achieve higher concentration for downstream analysis (protein gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting see Figure 3, eluate (E), protein mass spectrometry, singleparticle analysis, size-exclusion chromatography, etc.).# Notes:a. When working with solubilized thylakoids, use buffers supplemented with 0.04% DDM at all steps. Use buffers without detergent when working with soluble proteins.# bio-protocolb. FLAG-resin should never be allowed to dry out during the purification.c. Thaw the FLAG resin on ice and mix thoroughly before use.d. The FLAG resin is stored in buffer as a 50% solution, which means that pipetting 600 µl of the well mixed solution will result in 300 µl resin bed volume.e. For low abundant proteins, the number of binding steps (Step D6) can be increased.f. The stringency of the purification can be altered by increasing the number of washing steps.()()Immunodetection (α-FLAG)Figure 3. Immunoblot analysis following the purification of geranylgeranyl reductase enzyme tagged with 3x FLAG-tag (FLAG-ChlP). The purification of FLAG-ChlP from Synechocystis was performed according to this protocol. Protein suspension that was loaded in Step D4 (L; solubilized thylakoid membranes of 0.5ug chlorophyll), the first flowthrough in Step D4 (FT; equal volume to L), the first wash in Step D5 (W1; 1/25 volume of the wash fraction), the second wash in step 6 (W2; 1/25 volume of the wash fraction), and the eluate gained in Step D15 (E; 1/250 volume of total, non-concentrated eluate) were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (A) and by a subsequent immunoblot (B). Prior to Western blotting on a PVDF membrane the gel was stained with SYPRO Orange (Sigma) to detect total proteins (A). Proteins blotted on the membrane were probed with the a. -FLAG antibody (Merck) (A); the protein band, representing the isolated FLAG-ChlP, is indicated.# Notes1. The MES buffer system pH 6.5 containing M g^2+ and Ca^2+ ions used in this procedure has been optimized to maximize the stability of PSII complexes (Dobáková et al., 2009). A different buffer composition may be required for the stability of different protein complexes.2. The protein concentration in soluble fraction can be assessed e.g., by BCA assay or other standard methods. However, for assessing the concentration of the membrane fraction, it is more convenient to relate to its chlorophyll content the protein concentration (u/ul) in Synechocystis thylakoids is roughly ten times higher than that of chlorophyll.3. Measurement of chlorophyll concentration: Pipet 10ul of thylakoids into a 1.5m microtube and add 990 µl methanol using a Hamilton syringe. Vortex and incubate the tube in the dark at room temperature for 5 min. Pellet cell debris by centrifuging at 16,800xg (Eppendorf 5418) at room temperature for 5 min. Measure the chlorophyll absorbance at 665.2 nm and sample turbidity at 750n m , and calculate the chlorophyll a concentration (u/ul) of the thylakoids: ((A_665.2-A_750)/a) × 100×1 cm^-1 (a=79.95L^-1cm^-1 ; Porra et al., 1989).4. Always perform a control purification with a wild-type strain to exclude contaminants from your analysis of results. For example, a small amount of Synechocystis trimeric photosystem I and tryptophanyl-tRNA  synthetase  are  typical  contaminants  of  our  FLAG-tag  purifications (Knoppová et al., 2014; Bučinská et al., 2018; Skotnicová et al., 2018).5. In case the purification fails or the protein yield is very low, make sure that your protein of interest is expressed and not degraded in vivo or during the preparation of cellular fractions (perform SDS-PAGE and immunodetection using commercially available anti-FLAG antibody (Merck). A representative SDS gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblot analysis of purification (Steps D7-D9) and elution (Step D15) are presented in Figure 3. In the case of membrane proteins, compare the unsolubilized and solubilized fractions to check protein solubility (a detergent with different properties than DDM may be required for the solubility or stability of the desired protein complex). In addition, compare your original SP and/or solubilized TM samples with the obtained flowthrough in Step D7 (Figure 3). The relative amount of your protein in flowthrough should significantly decrease when compared with the loaded material; otherwise it signifies a problem with binding to the resin. For the purification of proteins requiring metal cofactors an EDTA-free protease inhibitor should be used.# Recipes1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1531","title":"Sequence Alignment Using Machine Learning for Accurate Template-based Protein Structure","text":"Sequence Alignment Using Machine Learning for Accurate Template-based Protein Structure\n\n# Abstract\n\nTemplate-based modeling, the process of predicting the tertiary structure of a protein by using homologous protein structures, is useful when good templates can be available. Indeed, modern homology detection methods can find remote homologs with high sensitivity. However, the accuracy of template-based models generated from the homology-detection-based alignments is often lower than that from ideal alignments. In this study, we propose a new method that generates pairwise sequence alignments for more accurate template-based modeling. Our method trains a machine learning model using the structural alignment of known homologs. When calculating sequence alignments, instead of a fixed substitution matrix, this method dynamically predicts a substitution score from the trained model.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe primary purpose of the training phase is to generate k -NN model that will be used for substitution score prediction in the prediction and alignment generation phase. The prediction phase consists of score prediction and alignment generation. Figure 1 shows the overview of the method.

They can be responsible for more serious pathology or treatment failure. For the detection of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), sequence-dependent and -independent methods are available, such as quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence, dot blot, ELISA or sequencing. The technique presented here is sequenceindependent and is well detailed in the following protocol, taking the example of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) in Leishmania guyanensis (Lgy) species. To summarise, the protocol is divided into four major steps: RNA extraction from the parasites, RNA purification, enzymatic digestions with DNase I and Nuclease S1, and visualization by gel electrophoresis. This method can be used to detect other viral dsRNA in other parasites. It provides an additional tool, complementary to other techniques previously cited and it is easy and quite fast to achieve.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Certain illustrations are from Servier Medical Art, licensed under a Creative Common Attribution 3.0 Unported License. https://smart.servier.com/.A. Total RNA extraction (not DNA-free) from Leishmania parasites (see Figure 1)Note:  The  strains  are  not  available  commercially.  They  are  derived  from  Lgy  M4147 (MHOM/BR/75/M4147).1. Under a laminar flow hood, collect 5~ml of a 10~ml stationary phase parasite culture (day 6 of culture, for a detailed protocol of culture, see pages 3 and 4 of the Bio-protocol by Reverte and Fasel, 2019) in a 50ml tube. Note: The authors recommend to use a 50 ml tube even for 5 ml parasites, as discarding the medium from the pellet (at Step A3) is easier with a 50 ml tube.2. Centrifuge at 2,000× g for 10m i n at 24~^°C .3. Under a laminar flow hood, discard the medium and resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of DPBS 1x.4. Under a laminar flow hood, transfer to a 1.5ml tube.5. Centrifuge at 2,500× g for 10m i n at 4^°C .6. Under a laminar flow hood, discard the supernatant.7. Resuspend and homogenize the pellet with 1 volume of T Rl^°leddash reagent (1ml) under chemical hood, in order to extract RNA from the parasites. At this step, the sample can be kept for a few weeks at -80~^°C .B. Total RNA purification (not DNA-free) from Leishmania parasites (see Figure 1)Note: The following protocol is adapted from the protocol of tau R/^scriptscriptstyle reagent provided by the manufacturer.1. Clean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAYTM reagent.2. If kept at -80~^°C , thaw the sample and let equilibrate to room temperature (RT) for 5 min.3. Under chemical hood, add 1/5 volume of chloroform (200ul) .4. Mix vigorously and wait for 2 min at room temperature.5. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4^°C .6. Transfer the upper aqueous phase (approximately 500ul ) into a new 1.5m tube.7. Add the same volume of isopropanol (here 500ul ) and mix, wait for 5 min at room temperature. Note: At this step, the purification procedure can be stopped and the tube can be stored at - 20~^°C overnight.8. Centrifuge at 12,000× g , for 20m i n , at 4^°C .9. Discard the supernatant and add 1 volume of Ethanol 75% (1 ml) to the pellet.10. Centrifuge at 7,500× g , for 10m i n , at 4^°C and discard the supernatant.11. Let the pellet dry at room temperature under the chemical hood for approximately 10m i n . Note: Do not over dry the pellet as it may be difficult to dissolve.12. Add 25ul UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water and vortex briefly to dissolve the pellet at room temperature.13. Put the tube on ice and measure RNA concentration with 1.5ul RNA with NanoDropTM. Check that the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios are of good quality (not contaminated).Note: Make the blank of the NanoDropTM with 1.5 µl of UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water. 14. RNA can be kept at -80~^°C for long storage. Note: Repeated freeze and thaw can decrease the concentration of the RNA and fresh RNA can give better results.C. Enzymatic digestion of total RNA (not DNA-free) from Leishmania parasites: degradation of DNA by DNase I, and single-stranded DNA or RNA by Nuclease S11. Clean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAYTM reagent.2. Warm up the water bath to 37^°C .3. Thaw parasite-isolated total RNA (if frozen) and keep on ice. Note: If the RNA is frozen, measure RNA concentration with NanoDropTM after it thaws.4. In a new 1.5m tube, add between 5 and 50ug of RNA, on ice.5. For 1 reaction, digest the total RNA (not DNA-free) with 60~U of Nuclease S1 in Buffer S1 1x and with 10U of DNase I in UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water. Note: In a new 1.5 ml tube on ice, prepare the enzymatic mix for several reactions: mix DNase I, Nuclease S1, Buffer S1 diluted to 1x and UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water. Then dispense on RNA. This enzymatic mix has been tested on the range: 5 to 50 µg of RNA.6. Prepare an undigested negative control for each sample: in a new 1.5~m tube, on ice, add between 2 and 5u of RNA and dilute in UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water (final volume of 10ul ). Note: Different quantities of RNA between digested and undigested samples have been used to avoid huge differences of exposure times between them when acquiring pictures of the gel electrophoresis.7. Vortex briefly and spin down.8. Incubate the tubes containing RNA and enzymatic mix, and negative control (without enzymatic mix), in the water bath at 37 ^°C for 1h . Note: During this incubation time, the agarose gel can be prepared.9. At the end of the incubation, transfer the tubes with the digested RNA and the undigested negative control on ice. Note: At this step, the samples can be kept at -8O~^°C for several weeks.D. Visualization of viral dsRNA by migration on mini-gel electrophoresis1. Rinse the autoclaved glass bottles needed with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water, type Ultra ClearTM.2. Prepare 1x TBE solution (Recipe 5) in an autoclaved glass bottle.3. Prepare 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution (Recipe 6) in an autoclaved glass bottle.4. Clean the material for mini-gel electrophoresis (tank, spacers and comb) with 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution, then rinse very well with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water, type Ultra ClearTM and with RNase AWAYTM reagent.5. Prepare 0.8% agarose gel.a. Weigh agarose powder in an autoclaved glass bottle: 0.4 for 1 mini-gel.b. Add 1x TBE: 50ml for 1 mini-gel.c. Heat with a microwave until agarose is homogeneously dissolved. Note: Monitor the aspect of the mixture and be careful of the high temperature.d. Cool down at room temperature for a few min.6. Mount the mini-gel electrophoresis (see Figure 2).()Figure 2. Mini-gel migration system “home-made” for gel electrophoresis. This figure represents the different pieces to assemble before putting the agarose gel.7. Add SYBRTM Safe to agarose gel (0.5u1 for 1 mini-gel), shake well but without making bubbles and fill the electrophoresis tank.8. Remove potential bubbles with a tip and let the agarose gel polymerize for 30-45 min at room temperature.9. Pour 1x TBE in the electrophoresis tank ( 75m for 1 mini-gel) and carefully remove the spacers and the comb.10. Add 6x Gel Loading Dye to the samples: the digested RNA and the undigested negative control in order to have Gel Loading Dye at 1× .11. Load the wells with 10-25~ul of each sample and 2-4~ul of 1 kb DNA Ladder (50 u/ml) .12. Connect the electrophoresis tank to the power supply with cables: the top electrode is connected to the negative pole and the bottom electrode to the positive pole.13. Switch on the power supply: run the gel at 80-100 volts for 45-60 min, until the Gel Loading Dye has reached the % of the mini-gel.14. Switch off the power supply and disconnect the electrophoresis tank. 15. Transfer the gel to a transilluminator coupled to camera and printer, adjust the zoom, the focus and the exposure time, then take a picture of the mini-gel (see Figure 3). 16. Observe and analyse the picture of the gel electrophoresis (see Data analysis).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Total RNA Extraction\nCollect 5~ml of a 10~ml stationary phase parasite culture in a 50ml tube under a laminar flow hood.\nCentrifuge at 2,000× g for 10 minutes at 24~°C.\nDiscard the medium and resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of DPBS 1x under a laminar flow hood.\nTransfer to a 1.5ml tube under a laminar flow hood.\nCentrifuge at 2,500× g for 10 minutes at 4~°C.\nDiscard the supernatant under a laminar flow hood.\nResuspend and homogenize the pellet with 1 volume of TRizol reagent under a chemical hood.\n## Total RNA Purification\nClean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAY reagent.\nThaw the sample and let equilibrate to room temperature for 5 minutes if kept at -80~°C.\n## Chloroform Addition and Mixing\nAdd 1/5 volume of chloroform.\nMix vigorously and wait for 2 minutes at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000× g for 15 minutes at 4~°C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase into a new 1.5ml tube.\n## Isopropanol Addition and Precipitation\nAdd the same volume of isopropanol and mix.\nWait for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000× g for 20 minutes at 4~°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 volume of Ethanol 75% to the pellet.\nCentrifuge at 7,500× g for 10 minutes at 4~°C and discard the supernatant.\nLet the pellet dry at room temperature under the chemical hood for approximately 10 minutes.\nAdd 25ul UltraPure DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water and vortex briefly to dissolve the pellet at room temperature.\nMeasure RNA concentration with 1.5ul RNA with NanoDrop and check the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios.\n## Enzymatic Digestion of Total RNA\nClean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAY reagent.\nWarm up the water bath to 37~°C.\nThaw parasite-isolated total RNA and keep on ice.\nAdd between 5 and 50ug of RNA to a new 1.5ml tube on ice.\n## Enzymatic Mix Preparation and Digestion\nPrepare the enzymatic mix with Nuclease S1, DNase I, Buffer S1, and UltraPure DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water.\nAdd the enzymatic mix to the RNA and vortex briefly.\nPrepare an undigested negative control by adding 2-5ul of RNA to a new 1.5ml tube and diluting with UltraPure DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water.\nIncubate the tubes at 37~°C for 1 hour.\nTransfer the tubes to ice after incubation.\n## Visualization of Viral dsRNA by Migration on Mini-Gel Electrophoresis\nRinse the autoclaved glass bottles with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water.\nPrepare 1x TBE solution and 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution in autoclaved glass bottles.\n## Mini-Gel Electrophoresis Preparation\nClean the material with 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution and rinse with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water and RNase AWAY reagent.\nPrepare 0.8% agarose gel by weighing agarose powder and adding 1x TBE, then heating until dissolved.\nMount the mini-gel electrophoresis and add SYBR Safe to the agarose gel.\nFill the electrophoresis tank with 1x TBE and remove the spacers and comb.\n## Sample Loading and Electrophoresis\nAdd 6x Gel Loading Dye to the samples.\nLoad the wells with 10-25ul of each sample and 2-4ul of 1 kb DNA Ladder.\nRun the gel at 80-100 volts for 45-60 minutes.\nTransfer the gel to a transilluminator and take a picture.\nObserve and analyze the picture of the gel electrophoresis.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Microbiology & Virology"}}

The strength and nature of these interaction modes can be determined by different experimental approaches. Among those, Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) offers certain advantages by providing binding constants and thermodynamic parameters from titration series without a need to label or immobilize one or more interaction partners. Furthermore, second messenger homeostasis involving Ca^2+ -ions requires in particular knowledge about stoichiometries and affinities of Ca^2+ -binding to Ca^2+ -sensor proteins or Ca^2+ -dependent regulators, which can be obtained by employing ITC. We used ITC to measure these parameters for a set of neuronal  C a^2+ -sensor proteins operating in photoreceptor cells. Here, we present a step wise protocol to (a) measure Ca^2+ interaction with the Ca^2+ - sensor guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1, (b) to design an ITC experiment and prepare samples, (c) to remove Ca^2+ nearly completely from  C a^2+ binding proteins without using a chelating agent like EGTA.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Workflow summary of experimental steps for determination of  c a^2+ -binding to bGCAP1 by ITC# A.  Protein expressionNote: Protein expression and purification is not in the main focus of this report, see some steps below for a general understanding.1.  Use E. coli cells (BL21-CodonPlus, Stratagene) containing plasmid with bovine GCAP1 (bGCAP1) sequence for overnight culture (v=5m l) ).2.  Put 5ml culture in 500ml of LB medium to express protein in cells for up to 4h after induction.3.  Harvest the cells by centrifugation ^5,000×g, 10 min, 4^°C_. ). Resuspend cell pellet in 50~m M Tris Buffer with p H7.5 ( ^20 m l for pellet resulting from a bacterial culture of 500ml ).4.  The protein was purified as described previously (Hwang and Koch, 2002; Koch and Helten, 2008) using a two-step chromatography protocol (size exclusion chromatography and anion exchange chromatography).B.  bGCAP1 dialysis1.  Run polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 12% polyacrylamide gel to confirm the protein purity (see image of gel below, Figure 2).2.  Prepare (activate) the dialysis membrane with 5 mM EGTA using the following steps:a.  Cut the membrane if necessary (10 cm should be sufficient) and put in a glass beaker filled with double-distilled water ( d d H_2 O) and boil in microwave until water is boiling.b.  Remove the hot water and fill with fresh water and add 5 mM EGTA and boil again.c.  Remove the EGTA containing water and repeat the Step B2b twice.d.  Store this activated membrane in a glass beaker with EGTA free water in a cold room at 4^°C . Storage under this condition is possible for a maximum of one month. Note: Never store the activated dialysis membrane without water. Never touch the dialysis membrane without gloves.3.  Prepare dialyzing buffer (from now until ITC buffer, see below under “Recipes”) with pH 7.5.4.  Take one fraction of freshly purified bGCAP1 protein after anion exchange chromatography (maximum volume 10ml ). See fraction the gel image (Figure 2).()Figure 2. SDS-PAGE analysis of bGCP1 fractions. Fractions obtained by anion exchange chromatography are analyzed, “wash” indicates the non-bound fractions, 1-5 are eluted bGCAP1 fractions. Sample #2 was of highest purity (95%) and was used in ITC experiments.5.  Put on gloves and take the activated membrane. Put the knot at one side of the membrane (you can also use stoppers to avoid protein leakage during dialysis but doing a knot is more effective), fill the membrane with 10 ml bGCAP1 protein using a pipette. Now put another knot to the other side of the membrane and then add the stoppers to both ends (see Figure 3).6.  Place the protein filled membrane into ITC buffer for overnight (minimum 3 L buffer for 10ml of bGCAP1 solution).()Figure 3. Assembling of dialysis membrane. Positions of knots and stopper are indicated.C.  Prepare chelex columns (anion exchange material for removing cations)1.  Before use, the chelex material must be regenerated, regardless whether it was used before or freshly obtained from the supplier. For this purpose, a solvent filtration device is best suited. The device contains a filter holder and a chamber on top of it. The filtration device is commonly used for filtration of solutions via a pump. Further, a polypyro 0.2um membrane filter is needed. It is placed on a holder (part of the commercial filtration device) and keeps the chelex resin on top of it, when a vacuum pump is turned on and a washing solution is sucked through the filter. Thereby, it prevents the chelex material flowing into waste. The steps of the regeneration and washing procedure are as follows: a.  Fill the chamber on top of the filter holder with chelex and wash with 500~ml of doubledistilled water. b.  Wash the chelex with _200ml of 1 M HCl. c.  Wash chelex with 500ml of double-distilled water. d.  Wash chelex with _200ml of NaOH. e.  Wash chelex with 500ml of double-distilled water again. Suspend in double-distilled water and transfer the chelex material to a plastic bottle.2.  Prepare a plastic bottle for chelex storage. Wash the bottle with a solution of 5 mM EGTA. Rinse with water before storing regenerated chelex.3.  Adjust the pH of the chelex suspension, it should be neutral (around 7). Otherwise it might harm the protein function of bGCAP1. Adjusting the pH of the chelex material can be a very difficult and time consuming. See Notes for some tips.4.  Take a used PD10 column and remove the column material (normally a gel filtration resin) and discard it. There is a small bed at the bottom of the PD10 column. Leave it inside the column. Use 6 M urea to clean the column in case the flow is slow. Fix the column to the column holderand fill it with chelex that is stored in water now (Figure 4). Let the water flows out and all chelex material stays inside the column. Your chelex bench column is ready to use.()Figure 4. Filling chelex material into a used (“old”) PD10 column. A. The PD 10 column is fixed by a conventional column holder. Chelex can be seen as white material in the pipette tip. It is filled into the PD10 column. B. Chelex is settling by gravity flow. Water or buffer will pass the bed or small platform at the bottom, which retains the chelex material. Any kind of tube can be used for collecting the flow-through.# D. Remove  C a^2+ from bGCAP1 (decalcify)1.  Use a pipette for removing bGCAP1 out of the dialysis membrane after overnight dialysis and transfer it to  a 15~ml Falcon tube. Check protein concentration with Bradford protein quantification  method  (Bradford,  1976).  Be  aware  that  Coomassie  dye-based  protein determination methods depend on the nature of the protein used for calibration.Tip: Use a protein specific calibration curve. Create this curve by using your protein of interest as standard. Prepare standard concentrations (1-10 µg/ml) by using a second independent method of protein determination for example measuring the UV absorbance. Determine the molar extinction coefficient (Pace and Schmid, 1997) and employ it by using the Lambert-Beer law; see below Step E4.2.  Take the chelex bench column and apply bGCAP1 (If the total column volume is 10 ml , 5 ml should be the bGCAP1 solution and 5~ml be the chelex material). Mix chelex with bGCAP1 inside column with slight hand rotations. Either leave the column in a cold room for half an hour or place it for end to end rotation in a cold room keeping bGCAP1 in direct contact with chelex. Note: It is necessary that bGCAP1 is in direct contact with the chelex material for removing C a^2+ .3.  Collect bGCAP1 from the column in Eppendorf tubes (2 m) and label the tubes with protein concentrations after measurement.E.  Decalcify the ITC buffer1.  Prepare another chelex bench column with fresh chelex and fix the column in a column holder.2.  Prepare plastic bottle (  C a^2+ -contamination might also originate from plastic material) to collect decalcified ITC buffer as following: a.  Take any 100-200ml plastic bottle and wash it with 1 M HCl. b.  Rinse the bottle with water. c.  Wash bottle again with 5 mM EGTA. d.  Rinse the bottle with double-distilled water.3.  Position the  C a^2+ -free plastic bottle under the column and pass 50~ml of ITC buffer (to avoid buffer mismatch prepare a larger stock of dialysis/ITC buffer).4.  Check how much Ca^2+ is left in decalcified buffer by determining free  C a^2+ in the buffer using BAPTA as indicator. Install WinASPECT spectroanalytical software or use any other running software for a spectrophotometer. Open the program and initialize the program by turning on the UV-lamp. Set the lamp wavelength at 254nm . Start absorbance measurement with reference sample that contains only buffer. Afterwards, measure absorbance of buffer mixed with BAPTA for three times (separate replicates) and calculate the average.5.  Buffer preparation for BAPTA measurements: a.  Take 500ul of decalcified ITC buffer for reference measurement. b.  Take 495ul buffer and mix with 5ul of BAPTA from 1 mM stock. c.  vortex the sample.6.  Calculate free  C a^2+ in buffer with equations listed below: Tota B A P T A=B A P T A_I+C a B A P T A C a B A P T A=C a^2+tB A P T A/K_D(C a) K_D(C a)=107n M ; dissociation constant of Ca^2+ binding to BAPTA under conditions of the ITC buffer (room temperature 22pm2^°C ; Tsien, 1980).As a first step, determine the concentration of Ca^2+ -free BAPTA (BAPTAf by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm. According to Lambert-Beer's law A=g×c×I , calculate c, concentration of BAPTAf; the other parameters are extinction coefficient varepsilonin1.6×10^4M^-1×c m^-1 and l= length of cuvette (e.g., 1 cm). With BAPTAf and the known concentration of total BAPTA (e.g., 20uM_. ) one can calculate CaBAPTA.For example, the average value of absorbance might be 0.095. With A=g×c×I we obtain0.095=1.6×10^4M^-1×c m^-1×1c mand for concentration 0=5.9uMThe concentration of Ca^2+ -bound to BAPTA isCaBAPTA = total BAPTA - BAPTAf=10uM-5.9uMC a^2+f=0.107u M×4.1u M/5.9u M C a^2+f=0.074u Mo r74n MA concentration of Ca^2+f of 74 nM might be the lower limit, which can be achieved. A concentration of Ca^2+f below 80~n M in the absence of  C a^2+ -chelating reagents like EGTA might be sufficient for most titrations. One can repeat the whole buffer decalcifying process to achieve this lower limit.F.  Prepare the ITC system1.  Wash the sample cell (the cavity for GCAP1 protein inside ITC instrument, Figure 5) with 5% Decon (system cleaning detergent). Start with 100ml of 5% Decon followed by 400ml of doubledistilled water. Remove residual water from the sample cell by inserting the loading syringe (Figure 6) and wash the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer. Afterwards, fill the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer and leave it until protein sample is ready. This helps to equilibrate the sample cell and also removes free  C a^2+ .2.  Wash the ITC sample syringe that is part of the ITC system (Figure 5) and automatically controlled by software. It contains the ligand or Ca^2+ in our case. Attach a 5 ml small syringe piston (an Omnifix small 5~ml syringe or reciprocating pump, see materials) to the sample syringe port with small plastic tube (Figure 5A). Fill a special ITC tube that comes with the ITC instrument with 5% Decon and fix it in holder under the ITC sample syringe (during titrations the ITC tube carries water to wash the syringe). Use the syringe piston to catch the 5% Decon after passing through the sample syringe. Repeat the same process with at least 30ml of water to remove any remaining detergent inside.3.  Dry the ITC sample syringe. Remove the ITC tube from the syringe holder and let syringe tip stay in air. Use the small syringe piston to pull air through the sample syringe. Remove all drops of waters by repeating the process several times.Tip: Click purge and refill button from software, this process will bring all the water at syringe tip and place a kim wipe at the tip to catch all water.()Figure 5. ITC system. A. The ITC sample syringe is connected to the Omnifix small syringe for the washing step (see text).The red arrow indicates top of the cavity that contains the sample and reference cells. For the titration, the whole sample syringe is moved to the opening of the cavity and positioned in a way that the long metal tip (blue arrow in right panel) is inserted. B. The sample tube for filling the  C a^2+ -solution into the sample syringe.()Figure 6. Image of the loading syringeG. Prepare protein sample for sample cell, syringe and reference cell1.  Sample cell: Calculate how much bGCAP1 is required for one measurement ( ^20uM final concentrations; see Note #17 for calculation of optimal ratio of ligand to protein), add the rest of decalcified ITC buffer to reach final concentration. Prepare another chelex column with at least _2ml of chelex material inside. Add the protein sample to the column and leave it on ice.2.  Prepare the sample for filling the ITC sample syringe (Ca^2+ in our case): use calcium standard solution, which is 10~/L (WTW D-82362 Weilheim) and dilute with decalcified ITC buffer to prepare a Ca^2+ solution with a final concentration of 0.5m M .3.  Collect the bGCAP1 sample from the chelex column in a tube (Tip: every time wash the tubeswith decalcified buffer before collecting a bGACP1 sample from the column to avoid any contamination of free calcium that might come from the tube walls). Put small magnet stir bars in the tubes and degas both samples (  C a^2+ and bGCAP1 solution) for at least 10 min. Set the degasser temperature at _25°0 as the experiment is also performed at 25^°C . Degasser is also part of ITC system and provided by ITC suppliers.4.  Reference cell (second cavity inside ITC instrument to hold water or buffer as reference): Fill double-distilled water in a fresh tube and degas it for 10 min. Transfer the water to the reference cell with a loading syringe (the loading syringe is only used to load a protein solution into the sample cell and water or buffer into the reference cell). The syringe also comes with ITC instrument (be very careful to avoid adding air bubbles in cells).# H. Load samples1.  Fix the tube containing the  C a^2+ -solution under the ITC sample syringe and load sample very carefully (Figure 5B). Sometimes a few air bubbles are left inside the sample holder. To avoid trapping of air bubbles, click close port button in the software and pull the piston very carefully at the same time. (This saves sample and avoids adding air bubbles). Click purge and refill button in the software twice to release the entire sample back into the tube and let it slowly load again. This trick removes all small air bubbles.2.  Wash the loading syringe with water and remove the entire decalcified ITC buffer from the sample cell, which was used to wash the sample cell. Remove the buffer from the loading syringe and make sure there is no buffer left in the sample cell. Do not touch the loading syringe with anything at this moment and fill it with bGCAP1 sample after degassing. Insert the loading syringe needle into sample cell and release the sample slowly. (Tip: loading sample with the loading syringe can easily create small air bubbles that can affect the measurement. To avoid loading air bubbles proceed as follows: when the sample is visible in the sample reservoir, load back a small volume and release with a short pressure pulse so that all bubbles appear on the top, then remove them). Remove all excess sample from the sample reservoir.I. Start the titration experiment1.  Hold the ITC sample syringe in one hand and wash its tip with decalcified ITC buffer (the syringe tip was inside the Ca^2+ solution and we need to prevent any contamination of bGCAP1 sample with Ca^2+ before starting the experiment). Use a minimum of 1 ml decalcified ITC buffer to wash the syringe tip. Afterwards, remove extra buffer drops around the syringe tip with kimwipes and place the syringe to the sample cell. Note: Do it very slowly and be very careful not to hit the tip with anything that can bend the tip easily.2.  After loading to the sample cell, take a small volume (a few µl) of bGCAP1 to check the final protein concentration in case it might have been changed due to previous steps (GCAP1 sample might be diluted due to passing over the chelex column). It is important to mention the correctprotein concentration to the software before starting the experiment.3.  Set program parameters as following: Total number of injects =50 Cell temp ^°=25 reference power ig(muc a l/sig)= ideal is between 3-10 cell concentration (m M)=0.02 syringe concentrations (m M)=0.5 injection volume (ul)=5 Initial delay (s)=210 Injection space time (s)=60 Feedback mode/gain = High Stirring speed (r m p)=307See the following link for more details about ITC instrument. https://ctrstbio.org.uic.edu/manuals/vpitc_manual.pdf# J.  Measurement of reference experimentsReference experiments are necessary for data analysis to correct the any heat change by dilution. These can originate from diluting the ligand into buffer or from injecting a buffer solution into the macromolecule (bGCAP1) solution, whereby dilution of the ligand into the buffer solution is more significant, because ligand concentrations are typically 20 times larger than that of macromolecules.1.  Load  C a^2+ solution in ITC sample syringe with the same concentration as above (0.5m M) and load (fill) decalcified ITC buffer in the sample cell. Record the heat change of dilution from ligand injection into buffer.2.  Load protein solution in sample cell with same concentration of bGCAP1 (20~uM) and load decalcified buffer to the syringe. Record the heat change of dilutions from buffer into macromolecule titration as outlined above.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Protein Expression\nUse E. coli cells (BL21-CodonPlus, Stratagene) containing plasmid

Among the diverse applied photoreceptors, phytochromes are the only ones that can be actively and reversibly switched between the active and inactive photostate by the illumination with cell-compatible red and far-red light. In this protocol, we describe the production of a biotinylated variant of the photosensory domain of A. thaliana phytochrome B (PhyB-AviTag) in E. coli with a single, optimized expression plasmid. We give detailed instructions for the purification of the protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and the characterization of the protein in terms of purity, biotinylation, spectral photoswitching and the light-dependent interaction with its interaction partner PIF6. In comparison to previous studies applying PhyB-AviTag, the optimized expression plasmid used in this protocol simplifies the production process and shows an increased yield and purity.

Estimation of biotinylation efficiency (for representative results see Note 7):a  Transfer 400~ul of streptavidin agarose slurry (equivalent to 200~ul settled beads) into a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube and pellet beads by centrifugation at 500× g for 3 min.b  Wash beads by removing supernatant, resuspending beads in squigarrow beads buffer and pelleting beads again by centrifugation. Repeat this washing step 3 times.c  Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in 200ul beads buffer.d Dilute PhyB-AviTag in beads buffer to a concentration of 80u/ml and make 200ul aliquots into 6×1.5:ml microcentrifuge tubes.e  Add each 100~ul of beads suspension to 3 PhyB-AviTag containing tubes and each 100~ul of beads buffer to the 3 remaining tubes.f Incubate for 1 h while mixing tubes every 15 min.g Pellet beads by centrifugation and transfer 200~ul of the supernatants each into a new 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.h  Pellet remaining beads by centrifugation and transfer 100~ul of the supernatants each into a well of a black 96-well plate. Transfer 100~ul of the PhyB-AviTag samples without beads each into a well of the same plate.i Illuminate proteins in the plate for 3 min with 740n m light (intensity: 100umol/(m^2s)) .j Transfer the plate in the dark (only dim green safe light) into the microplate reader and measure phytochrome fluorescence of the 6 samples (excitation: 635nm , emission: 680 n m_~ ). Estimate the ratio of non-biotinylated PhyB-AviTag as the quotient of the fluorescence of the beads and the buffer samples.3.  Spectral analysis of PhyB-AviTag photoswitching (for representative results see Figure 3):a  Transfer 200~ul of PhyB-AviTag in protein buffer (concentration: 1 m g/ m l) into a well of a UV-transparent 96-well plate.b Illuminate protein for 3 min with 660 or 740n m light (intensity: 100um o l/(m^2s)) .c Transfer the plate in the dark (only dim green safe light) into the microplate reader and measure absorbance spectra (250-900 nm, step size: 1 nm).d  Repeat the measurement for the other illumination wavelength using the same sample.()A non-frozen PhyB-AviTagB  frozen and thawed PhyB-AviTag()()()Figure 3. Spectral analysis of PhyB-AviTag photoswitching. PhyB-AviTag ( 1 m g/ m l , never frozen A. and frozen and thawed B. was illuminated for 3 min with either 660 or 740~n m light (intensity: 100 ummm>/( m^2 s)) before acquisition of the absorbance spectra (left panels). The absorbance spectra in A. and B. were each normalized to 1 at 280 n m absorbance of the corresponding 740n m spectrum to compensate for slight protein concentration variations. The difference spectra (right panels) were calculated by subtracting the 660 nm spectra from the corresponding 740n m spectra. The peak wavelengths of the main peaks and of the isosbestic point are indicated. Freezing and thawing PhyB-AviTag once did not affect its absorbance spectra.4.  Analysis of light-dependent PhyB-AviTag/PIF6 interaction by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, for representative results see Figure 4): a  Produce and purify GFP-PIF6 as described for PhyB-AviTag with the following modifications:i.  Transform plasmid pHB111 (encoding GFP-PIF6(1-100)-His6 Beyer et al., 2018b) into E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS and select for transformed cells with 100 u/m l ampicillin and 34 u/m l chloramphenicol. ii.  After induction, incubate at 30^°C and 150 rpm for 6 h before harvesting.b  Determine protein concentration of PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6 by Bradford assay (see Procedure B).c  Mix PhyB-AviTag (final concentration: 2m g/m l) with an equimolar amount of GFP-PIF6 in protein buffer (total volume: 800 ul) and distribute solution equally into 2~x~1.5~m~l~ microcentrifuge tubes. For the molecular weights of both proteins, see legend of Figure 2.d  SEC analysis: i.  Protect SEC column from light with aluminum foil and connect it to an FPLC/Äkta system equipped with a 200ul sample loop. ii.  Equilibrate column with 30ml of protein buffer. iii.  Load protein solution from one microcentrifuge tube into a transparent syringe and illuminate the protein for 3 min with 660n m or 740n m light (intensity: 100umol/(um^2s)) . iv.  Inject the protein in the dark (only dim green safe light) into the sample loop and start SEC run. Use a flow rate of 1m l/m i n and monitor absorbance at 280n m , 488 nm (GFP) and 671 nm (PhyB-AviTag). Once the protein is completely on the light-protected column (usually after a few ml), the room light can be switched on again. v.  Calibrate the column by performing one run with a gel filtration standard.()A non-frozen PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6B frozen and thawed PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6()C non-frozen PhyB-AviTag()Figure 4. Analysis of light-dependent PhyB-AviTag/PIF6 interaction by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). A, B. 200ul of an equimolar mixture of PhyB-AviTag (2.2 m g/m l) and GFP-PIF6 .eginarrayl l1.2& m g/ m lendarray) was illuminated for 3 min with 660 or 740 nm light (intensity: 100 um o l/(m^2s)) and analyzed by SEC in the dark. Never frozen PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6 A. and frozen and thawed proteins B. were analyzed. Freezing and thawing PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6 once did not affect their light-dependent interaction. C. As control, 200~ul of never frozen PhyB-AviTag (2.2 m g/ m l) was analyzed alone. The absorbance was monitored at 280~n m (total protein), 488~n m (absorption maximum of GFP-PIF6) and at 671 nm (isosbestic point of PhyB-AviTag). Calibration of the column with a gel filtration standard is indicated by the dotted line.# Notes1.  Protect PhyB-AviTag (starting from induction of protein production in E. coli) from bright light such as direct sunlight. If possible, shade the lab, work under dim room light and protect PhyBAviTag from light (e.g., by covering with aluminum foil) whenever easily possible (e.g., during incubation times). Working under green safe light (absorption minimum of PhyB-AviTag) is only required when the photostate of PhyB-AviTag should not be changed. Regular room light switches PhyB-AviTag usually similar as 660~n m light in the Pfr state, in which it interacts with PIF6.2.  As each passage of the sample through a high pressure homogenizer/French press heats the sample, cool the lysate on ice before the next passage. As alternative to a high pressure homogenizer/French press, bacteria can also be lysed by sonication.3.  Instead of using an FPLC/Äkta system for IMAC and buffer exchange, gravity flow columns can be used for small volumes/amounts.4.  The reducing agent TCEP is not particularly stable in phosphate buffers. Therefore, always add TCEP from the stock solution to PBS directly before use. Although TCEP is more stable in HEPES buffer, it is still recommended to always add TCEP directly before use.5.  Using the described purification protocol, the typical yield for PhyB-AviTag is 4m g of purified protein per 1 L expression culture. If high amounts of PhyB-AviTag are required, the protein can be produced in the multigram scale per 10~L high-cell-density fermentation run (Hörner et al., 2019b).6.  PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6 can be stored at 4^°C in the dark for at least two weeks. At -80~^°C in the dark, the proteins can be stored for several years. Freeze the proteins in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol in aliquots and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Storing PhyB-AviTag and GFP-PIF6 at -80~^°C overnight did not affect their light-dependent interaction and the spectra of PhyB-AviTag (Figures 3 and 4).7.  The estimation of the biotinylation efficiency described in Procedure, section C2 revealed 80% biotinylation of PhyB-AviTag. If higher biotinylation is required, consider co-transformation of an additional plasmid encoding E. coli biotin ligase (BirA). Make sure to use a plasmid with a compatible origin of replication. The PhyB-AviTag plasmid pMH1105 is based on the commercial vector pCDFDuet (Novagen) with a CloDF13-derived CDF replicon (CDF ori) (Hörner et al., 2019b).# RecipesNote: If not stated otherwise, store all solutions at room temperature.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1658","title":"Isolation and Characterization of Live Yeast Cells from Ancient Clay Vessels","text":"Isolation and Characterization of Live Yeast Cells from Ancient Clay Vessels\n\n# Abstract\n\nAncient fermented food has been studied mainly based on residue analysis and recipes and reconstruction  attempts  were  performed  using  modern  domesticated  yeast.  Furthermore, microorganisms which participated in fermentation were studied using ancient-DNA techniques. In a recent paper, we presented a novel approach based on the hypothesis that enriched yeast populations in fermented beverages could have become the dominant species in storage vessels and their descendants could be isolated and studied today. Here we present a pipeline for isolation of yeast from clay vessels uncovered in archeological sites and transferred to the microbiology lab where they can be isolated and characterized. This method opens new avenues for experimental archeology and enables attempts to recreate ancient food and beverages using the original microorganisms.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Lab gloves\n2. 50ml Falcon tubes (MINIPLAST EIN SHEMER, catalog number: 835-050-21-111)\n3. Clean plastic container\n4. Aluminum foil\n5. Tube markers\n\n# Equipment\n\n1.  Folding table\n2.  Recording device/s including camera, tablet, laptop, and cellular phones\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nNote: In sites where containers intended for isolation of microorganisms are expected, do not allow any kind of food or beverage in the excavation area (primarily fruit, vegetables, beer, yogurt, bread, pickles, cheese but also others).A.  Before and while excavating1.  Define vessels that are to be collected for microorganisms’ isolation. For example:a.  Vessels that are clearly meant for storing, serving and drinking of beverages or food or, vessels carrying beverage-related specific features, such as strainers (Figure 1).b.  Vessels suggested to have been previously used for the preparation of fermented beverages and food such as dairy products (e.g., churns).c.  For more examples see also Aouizerat et al. (2019).2.  Increase the awareness of the team so that they are prepared to collect vessels for microorganisms’ isolation based on the context of the site. For instance, in the case of the discovery of a drinking set in situ, or a possible production site.3.  Make sure that no fermented food of any kind, including unfiltered beer, sourdough and wine are being consume in the site. In addition, it is recommended that workers wash their hands and faces before starting.()Figure 1. Putative beer jug. An example of a vessel thought to be a beer jug due to its shape and strainer.B.  Excavation and sample handling in the field1.  Identify vessels suitable for microorganisms’ isolation as soon as you can, in situ, before they are fully uncovered.2.  Visually record the excavation process, and fully document the vessel (drawing, photography, textual description) within its context, prior to its extraction from the soil.3.  Set up a folding table near the vessel and cover the table with clean aluminum foil.4.  From now on, work on this vessel using disposable lab or cotton gloves.5.  When the identified vessel is uncovered, decide if and how much of the vessel can be broken based on the policy of the excavators and government regulations.6.  Immediately after the initial uncovering, take small pieces (5.6~c m) of the vessel and transfer them to 50ml tubes using gloves at all times. Note: Try to minimize vessel exposure time before the initial sampling.7.  Label the tubes with a tube marker and record the time, place, specific context, excavator, and type of sherd.8.  Carefully, using laboratory gloves, excavate the vessels according to the excavation’s regular protocol. Note: Only dedicated and guided personnel, preferably only one, should touch the sherds to avoid possible contamination.9.  While uncovering, identify parts of the vessel that are more likely to hold microorganisms such as the base, strainer and the side of the curve towards the neck. These parts of the vessel will be the focus of efforts from now on.10. Transfer the collected fragments to the table, keep them in plastic containers and label them accordingly. Note: Do not wash the pieces meant for microorganisms’ isolation.11. Label the other fragments of the uncovered vessel that are not to be sent to the lab with the same ID, to keep them for restoration and other analyses.12. Always keep some fragments unwashed in case the lab would need more fragments.13. Transfer the plastic containers with the sherds for microorganism analysis to the microbiology lab (see below). Note: In specific cases, an entire vessel can be chosen to be taken to the lab. In that case, try to minimize the time of the vessel exposure and excavate it, record and transfer it to a plastic container as soon as possible.# Control vessels and control soil samples:Note: Non-related controls are a key component in the analysis, to ensure that the isolated microorganisms originated in the vessel and are not an environmental contamination. 14. Using gloves, collect as many samples as possible of: sediments, stones, plants, and roots from the vessel’s surroundings. Store them in 50ml plastic tubes.15. Identify vessels which in high probability are unrelated to microorganisms, such as burned cooking pots, small vessels/juglets (i.e., putative perfume containers), and other vessels, and process them as described above for the putative fermented food containers. Note: Containers suspected to have held oily products should not be considered as controls, since yeast are major inhabitants of oil (Aouizerat et al., 2019).# C.  Delivery to the lab1.  Using gloves at all times, transfer the tubes, containers and their documentation to the lab.2.

The beginning steps do not need sterile work conditions. However, after the initial isolation of the yeast, work in a laminar hood or near a burner.A.  Yeast isolation from vessels and control samples1.  Put the sherds in a plastic container and cover them with sterile liquid YPD medium.2.  Incubate at room temperature without shaking for 7 days.3.  Spread 0.1Omega^m samples from the medium on selective agar plates for fungal isolation and incubate at 30~^°C for 12 to 48h .4.  Inspect the plates frequently for the appearance of yeast colonies (Figure 2A). Note: Yeast colonies usually grow faster than molds and filamentous fungi. Do not wait for more than 48h or the plate will be covered by molds and filamentous fungi.()Figure 2. Yeast colonies and cells. Yeast have typical colonies and cell morphology both of which are distinct from molds and bacteria. A. several types of yeast colonies isolated from ancient vessels (Aouizerat et al., 2019). In general, yeast colonies are relatively large with a shiny white color in contrast to bacterial colonies which are usually small and matte. B. Yeast cells observed under light microscopy (60x). Note that yeast cells are usually bigger than typical bacteria and many kinds of yeast divide by budding rather than fission. C. Upper panel, a selective agar plate for fungal isolation was plated as described in the Procedure A of Part II. Note the low number of bacterial colonies due to the antibiotics (blue circle), structure of molds (green circle) and distinctive shiny colony of yeast (red circle). In the bottom panel, a yeast colony which was picked and re-streaked on a YPD plate (red arrow).5.  Collect any colony which seems to be a yeast colony, observe for typical yeast cells using light microscopy (Figure 2B) and plate it on solid YPD agar plates, containing 2% w/v Bacto-agar (Figure 2C).6.  Incubate the plates at 30~^°C for 24-48h until yeast colonies are clearly observed. Note: If a mixture of molds and yeast grow, re-pick a separate yeast colony to a new YPD plate and repeat Step A6.7.  Inspect the colonies visually and under light microscope (60x magnification) for typical yeast cells which are distinct from bacteria colonies (Figure 2).8.  To make a frozen stock of the yeast, pick a single colony to 5 ml YPD broth and incubate it for 24h at 30^°C , in a shaker incubator under aerobic conditions with agitation (250-300 rpm).9.  Mix 0.5m of the culture with sterile 0.5ml glycerol (50%) , vortex to mix, aliquot and store at   - 80~^°C .B.  Yeast CharacterizationYeast DNA isolationNote: Yeast cell DNA isolation was performed as previously described (Holm et al., 1986).a.  Select a yeast containing tube from the -80~^°C and allow to defrost at room temperature. When thawed, perform isolation streak on a YPD plate and incubate at 30^°C until colonies are observed (about 48h ).b.  Transfer a single colony to 10mI YPD broth in a sterile 100ml flask. Grow the yeast overnight at 30~^°C with 200 rpm shaking.c.  Transfer the culture to 50ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min. Pour out the supernatant, re-suspend the pellet in sterile water, re-centrifuge and discard the supernatant.d.  In a fume hood, add 200ul of Phenol:chlorophorm:Isoamyl alcohol, 0.3 acid washed glass beads and 200ul of Smash and Grab solution and vortex for 3 min in order to lyse the cells.e.  Add 0.2m TE buffer and centrifuge the cells at 1,000× g for 5 min at room temperature.f.  Transfer the aqueous layer containing the DNA to 1ml ethanol and incubate it for 20 min at -80~^°C .g.  Wash by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 5 min and re-suspend in 0.4ml TE buffer. Note: DNA pellet is transparent and can be difficult to see–avoid losing the pellet.h.  Add 1 µl of RNase A.i.  Incubate the solution at 37 ^°C for 5:m i n .j. Add 10~ul of ammonium acetate (4 M) and 1ml of 70% ethanol and incubate for 20 min at -80~^°C .k.  Centrifuge at maximal speed for 10m i n (at least 15Kxg) and discard the supernatant.l.  Re-suspend the pellet in 50~ul of TE buffer.m. Quantify the DNA using Qubit, it should be 10-20 u/ml .n.  Store the extracted DNA at -20~^°C .# 2.  Yeast identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)Note: For rapid and cheap identification you can use sanger sequencing of the ITS region. Keep in mind that the specific yeast species might not be represented in the database and thus full genome sequencing is preferable.a.  Amplify the ITS region using Standard PCR kit and program with Illumina’s primers: ITS1F; ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACACTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA and ITS2R; TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCTGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC.b.  Send the PCR fragments for Sanger sequencing.c.  BLAST  the  sequence  results  against  the  ISHAM  barcoding  database (http://its.mycologylab.org) and the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi).3.  Full genome sequencing and assemblyNote: DNA sequencing can be performed using any common NGS technology. Our libraries were prepared using a Nextera XT DNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and the DNA was amplified by a limited-cycle PCR followed by purification using AMPure XP beads. The DNA libraries were normalized, pooled, and tagged in a common flow cell at 2×250 base-paired-end reads using the NextSeq platform. For more detailed protocols see Aouizerat et al. (2019). The assembly also can be performed using numerous NGS analysis tools. Here we describe the analysis we performed (Aouizerat et al., 2019).a.  Remove Illumina adaptors using Trimmomatic 0.36.b.  Determine the quality of the reads using FastQC.c.  Perform De-novo assembly with the Celera assembler 8.3rc2.d.  Exclude non-target-species scaffolds using BlobTools V1.4.  Growth curve analysis (in wort)Note: This procedure is used for the comparison of various growth parameters of yeast or bacteria in liquid under various conditions such as varying media, temperatures and addition of different compounds. Here, the growth of yeast in beer wort was performed, in order to test whether the isolated yeast might have been selected for in the past under such conditions. As a positive control we used a modern beer-producing strain of S. cerevisiae which is commercially available and as a negative control the pathogen yeast Candida parapsilosois which does not produce beer.# Wort PreparationNote: The wort is prepared according to a standard recipe (Kunze and Manger, 2004).a.  Heat water (5 L) to a pasteurization temperature of 72^°C .b.  Add malt extract to a final concentration of 100/L , while thoroughly stirring, and allow to infuse together for 30 min in temperatures between 63 and 67~^°C .c. Increase the solution temperature to 100~^° .d. Add 1 /L of hops.e.  Boil the solution for 45m i n . f.  Meanwhile prepare 5L ice-cold water by mixing water with ice cubes.g. Add 1 /L of hops once more.h. Let boil for an additional minute.i. Add the previously prepared ice-cold water (from Section f) to the mixture.j. Transfer the wort to a sterile flask and keep at 4^°C .# Growth curve comparisona.  Perform isolation streak of yeast from frozen stock on YPD agar plate.b.  Incubate the plate at 30~^°C for 48h .c. Transfer a colony to ^20m liquid YPD and incubate it at 30^°C , under aerobic conditions with agitation (250-300 rpm).d.  Centrifuge the yeast at 1,000× g for 5 min, wash in sterile PBS buffer and re-suspend the pellet in wort.e.  Dilute the solution 1:100 in wort.f.  Add 200ul of the diluted solution/well of 96-well plate in triplicates or more repeats.g.  Incubate the plate in a plate reader at 30^°C with linear shaking of 5 s every 20 min followed by an optical density (OD600) reading for 48–96h .h. Export the results to a text file (Figure 3A).i. Fit a logistic equation using R package “growthcurver” (Figure 3B).j. Compare the statistical significance of the differences between the various parameters using Student's t-test.k.  Determine the relative distance between the samples using Principal Components Analysis (PCA, R prcomp () command) (Figure 3C).()Figure 3. Example of growth curve analysis. A. Growth curves were read as output from the plate reader. B. A logistic curve was fitted to each curve using R growthcurver. C. A PCA representation of the distance between the various parameters of the logistic equations of each sample.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1695","title":"Gallyas Silver Impregnation of Myelinated Nerve Fibers","text":"Gallyas Silver Impregnation of Myelinated Nerve Fibers\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn the nervous system of vertebrates, nerve impulse propagation is accelerated by the ensheathment of neuronal axons with myelin. Myelin sheaths are molecularly specialized, lipid-rich plasma membrane extensions of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). To visualize myelinated nerve fibers and to allow for the morphological analyses of myelin in the brain and the spinal cord, an efficient method for silver impregnation of myelin has originally been developed by Ferenc Gallyas in 1979, referred to as Gallyas silver impregnation. Gallyas’ method is based on the agyrophilic characteristic of myelin to form and bind silver particles, while this process is suppressed in tissues other than myelin. The silver particles are finally enhanced in a developing step (“physical developer”). The main advantage of this method is that it efficiently visualizes both large myelinated fiber tracts and individual myelinated axons. Here we provide our laboratory protocol that is suitable for paraffin embedded sections and the use of light microscopy based on Gallyas’ original protocol and subsequent modifications by Pistorio and colleagues.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Paraffin embedding and microtome sectioning1.  Carefully remove the brain or spinal cord and post-fix it in 4% PFA for tissue for one hour up to overnight at 4^°C in a 50ml Falcon. Note: Prior to paraffin embedding of the brain, mice were subjected to transcardial perfusion.2.  Embed the brain in paraffin by using an automated embedding machine for best results.3.  Use the recommended protocol of your embedding machine. If no particular protocol is recommended, use the following protocol: Reagent Duration 50% ethanol 1 h 70% ethanol 2x 2 h 96% ethanol 2x 1 h 100% ethanol 2x 1 h 2-propanol 1 h xylene 2x 2 hparaffin 2x 2 h4.  Cut 5 µm sections using a microtome and mount sections on microscope glass slides. Air-dry at room temperature (RT). Store at room RT for future use. Note: A thickness of 5 µm is optimal for subsequent light microscopy. Mounting on slides is most conservative to the integrity of the sections.B.  Gallyas silver impregnation (Overview of protocol see Figure 1)1.  De-paraffinize  sections  by  incubating  for  10  min  each  in  xylene,  again  xylene  and 2-propanol/xylene (1:1). Afterwards incubate sections in 100% , 90% , 70% , 50% ethanol and distilled water (d H_2O) for 5 min each. Note: Formalin-fixed sections are also suitable for subsequent Gallyas silver staining as described in Pistorio et al., 2005. The conservation of morphology in paraffin sections however is superior to crysections.2.  To suppress staining of non-myelin tissue, incubate sections in pyridine/acetic anhydride (2:1, e.g., 200 ml of pyridine and 100 ml of acetic anhydride) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Note: Prepare solution fresh, stored solution will turn yellow and needs to be discarded.3.  Wash 3 times with d H_2O , for 10 min each.4.  Submerge sections in incubation solution, microwave for 2 min at 440 W. The incubation solution must not come to boil. The temperature should reach approximately 50~^°C . Let it cool down for 10 min at RT until lukewarm.5.  Wash sections 3 times in 0.5% acetic acid for 5 min each.6.  Develop sections in physical developing solution for 3-15 min. After 1-2 min, start monitoring the reaction under the microscope by placing the sections in 1% acetic acid (  '= interrupts developing reaction). To determine if staining has reached the desired intensity, compare to the optimal result shown in Figure 2. The color of myelin should be dark brown and should display a good contrast as compared to the background. If too pale, the sections can be exposed once again to the physical developing solution. Repeat until optimal result is reached.7.  Stop the staining reaction by incubating sections 3 times in 1% acetic acid for 5 min each.8.  Wash twice in d H_2O for 3 min each.9.  Incubate sections in 2% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min to fix the stain.10. Wash twice with dH_2O for 5 min each.11. Dehydrate  section  in 50% , 70% , 90% , 100% ethanol  for  each  5  min,  followed  by 2-propanol/xylene (1:1), xylene and again xylene for 10 min each.12. Mount sections with Eukitt and cover slips. Note: Sections, stored in slides boxes at RT, have a shelf life of many years.13. Result: Myelin and erythrocytes are stained black, sometimes nuclei are stained too, background is pale yellow (Figure 2).()Figure 1.

Using the light microscope (phase contrast for unlabeled cells), verify the cell attachment and the presence of a circular cell-free zone in each well. Exclude the wells that have an excessive amount of cells in a cell-free zone or have uneven distribution of cells in cell growth area (approximately 5% of wells).

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1799","title":"A Radioactive in vitro ERK3 Kinase Assay","text":"A Radioactive in vitro ERK3 Kinase Assay\n\n# Abstract\n\nMitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine kinases that have an important role in signal transduction. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), also known as MAPK6, is an atypical MAPK. Here, we describe in detail an in vitro assay for the kinase activity of ERK3 using myelin basic protein (MBP) or steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) as substrates. The assay is carried out in the presence of γ- ^32P -ATP which results in radiolabeling of phosphorylated substrates. Separation of the reaction components by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography enables detection of the radiolabeled products, and hence determination of the kinase activity of ERK3. This assay can be used for several applications including identification of substrates, determination of the effect of molecules or mutations on kinase activity, and testing specific kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, the protocol outlined here can be adapted to measure the activity of other kinases by using their specific substrates.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. Pipette tips\n2.

ImageJ (National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, USA, imagej.nih.gov/ij)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nThis assay is performed by mixing ERK3 protein, purified substrate, 5~uCi γ- ^32P -ATP, and 30 uM non-radioactive ATP in a kinase reaction buffer that contains  M g^2+ . Fifty to one hundred nanograms of ERK3 protein purified from Sf9 cells or mammalian cells can be used per reaction. If using ERK3 protein purified from bacteria, a larger amount has to be used (500 n g-1 u) . It is best to do an initial optimization experiment using different amounts of the kinase to determine the kinase concentration appropriate for phosphorylating substrate. A catalytically-inactive (kinase-dead) mutant of ERK3 can serve as a negative control for the reaction. In addition, a reaction that lacks ERK3 would confirm the absence of contamination of the substrate with radioactive isotopes or co-purified kinases. As for all enzymatic assays, the amount of substrate used in each reaction has to be in excess so that it is not rate-limiting. Typically about 0.5-2 u9 substrate is used per reaction.After incubation of ERK3 with the substrate in the presence of ATP, the reaction is stopped by addition of sample buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by boiling. Reaction components are separated by gel electrophoresis. The gel is then stained with Coomassie blue solution, dried and visualized by autoradiography (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Outline of radioactive in vitro ERK3 kinase assaySteps of the procedure are described below:1. Prepare a 10× kinase reaction buffer stock (listed in Recipes), and dilute an appropriate volume as needed with deionized water to 1× concentration.2. Dilute ERK3 protein and each purified substrate in 1× reaction buffer such that 1~ul of each is used per reaction. For example, if 100 ng ERK3 protein and 1u MBP will be used in the assay, dilute ERK3 to 100n g/ul , and MBP to 1 u g/u1 using 1× reaction buffer.Note: It is recommended to store purified proteins at -80~^°C in small aliquots to avoid multiple freeze-thaws. Thawing has to be done slowly on ice before an experiment is to be performed.3. Prepare 0.5 m M non-radioactive ATP solution by diluting stock ATP in 1× reaction buffer. It is best to prepare fresh dilute ATP at the time of the experiment, and to avoid repeated freezethaws of the stock ATP.4. Determine the volume of each component to be used such that the total reaction volume is 30 μl (Table 1). The ATP mix added per reaction contains 5~uCi γ- ^32P -ATP and non-radioactive ATP that yields final concentration of 30~uM . For example, ATP mix for one reaction can be prepared by mixing 0.5~ul of radioactive ATP ^10mu C i/mu l) and 1.8~uI of 0.5m M non-radioactive ATP.Note: The rate of decay of γ-32P-ATP has to be taken into consideration when calculating the volume required per reaction. Manufacturers specify a calibration or reference date, which corresponds to the indicated activity of a radiolabeled reagent. This date can be used to determine the residual activity of the radioactive isotope on the day the assay is conducted. For example, for an experiment to be done two weeks after the γ- ^32P J -ATP reference date, since the half-life of ^32P isotopes is 14.29 days, double the volume of radiolabeled ATP has to be used to account for the decreased activity. Hence, instead of mixing 1.8 μl of 0.5 mM non-radioactive ATP with 0.5 μl of radioactive ATP as suggested above, 1.8 μl of 0.5 mM non-radioactive ATP should be mixed with 1 μl of radioactive ATP. The total volume of each reaction should always be adjusted to 30 µl.Table 1. Components of each kinase reaction()5. Assemble reactions on ice by mixing all the components except for the ATP mix. If multiple reactions will use the same substrate, a master mix comprising 10× reaction buffer, substrate, and water can be prepared and distributed to the tubes to minimize pipetting errors.6. From this step onwards, precautions of using radioactive isotopes have to be taken. Prepare sufficient ATP mix for the number of assays to be performed. Start the reactions by adding an appropriate volume of ATP mix to each tube.Note: Radioactive material handling precautions have to be taken. These include the use of appropriate shielding materials such as Perspex shielding (3/8 inches thick) behind which all work should be done, and Perspex Eppendorf tube holders. Surfaces should be routinely monitored by Geiger counters, and ring dosimeters can be used to monitor personal exposure. Radioactive isotopes should be used only by authorized personnel in designated places following the institution’s biosafety regulations. Requisition and storage of radioactive material, solid and liquid radioactive waste disposal, and spill decontamination should be done following the institution’s regulations.7. Incubate the tubes in a water bath or sand bath at 30~^°C for 30m i n .8. Stop the reactions by adding 10~ul of 4× SDS sample buffer (listed in Recipes) followed by boiling at 95~^°C for 5 min. Spin down the tubes to bring the reaction components to the bottom of the tube.9. Load the entire volume of each reaction into a well of a 10-well polyacrylamide gel. The percentage of resolving gel depends on the molecular weight of protein substrates used in the assay. Run the gel at 100-130 constant voltage. It is important to stop gel running when the dye front is about 1-2 cm away from the bottom of the gel to prevent the entry of free γ- ^32P -ATP into the buffer in the gel tank. Cut the gel just above the dye front and discard the lower portion into solid radioactive waste.10. Stain the gel with a sufficient volume of InstantBlue Coomassie protein stain for 30m i n , followed by two washes using deionized water for 30 min each. Alternatively, standard Coomassie blue staining and destaining solutions can be used. Discard the solutions used for staining and washing into a liquid radioactive waste container.11. Place the gel on a thick filter paper, and dry it in a gel dryer at 70~^°C for 60 min.12. Expose radioactivity with X-ray film for an appropriate time as follows:a. In a dark room place the gel in an X-ray film cassette with an ×. -ray film directly above it.b. Close the cassette and put it in an X-ray cassette security bag to ensure light protection. The use of intensifying screens enhances the signal. Also, keeping the cassette in a -80~^°C freezer enhances the signal.c. Depending on the activity of the kinase towards the specific substrate (the phosphorylation level of the substrate), an X-ray film may be exposed for as short as ^2-3h , or as long as 1- 2 days.13. Develop and fix the X-ray film to visualize substrate phosphorylation by autoradiography. Dark bands appearing on the X-ray film correspond to phosphorylated substrate that is isotopelabeled. Several exposures can be obtained to ensure that the signal is not over-saturated.14. A representative image of an in vitro ERK3 kinase assay using MBP as substrate is shown in Figure 2. The first lane is a negative control reaction which lacks ERK3. The second lane is a reaction that contains ERK3 and MBP. Note that ERK3 protein is barely seen in the Coomassiestained gel because of its small amount, whereas the appearance of phosphorylated ERK3 band in the autoradiograph indicates ERK3 autophosphorylation.()Figure 2. Representative image of in vitro ERK3 kinase assay using MBP as substrate. ERK3 protein with an N-terminal HA-tag (HA-ERK3) was expressed in 293T cells. HA-ERK3 protein was then purified by immunoprecipitation using HA antibody-conjugated beads, followed by elution with HA peptide. In vitro kinase reaction was performed in the presence of γ- ^32P - ATP and MBP (1u) , with or without 100 ng purified ERK3 (lanes 2 and 1 respectively). Total protein levels of MBP in both reactions are shown by Coomassie staining (left panel). Phosphorylation of MBP is detected by autoradiography (right panel).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction to ERK3 Kinase Assay\nThis assay is performed by mixing ERK3 protein, purified substrate, 5~uCi γ-^32P-ATP, and 30 uM non-radioactive ATP in a kinase reaction buffer that contains Mg^2+.\nFifty to one hundred nanograms of ERK3 protein purified from Sf9 cells or mammalian cells can be used per reaction.\nIf using ERK3 protein purified from bacteria, a larger amount has to be used (500 ng-1 ug).\n## Preparation of Kinase Reaction Buffer and Reagents\nPrepare a 10× kinase reaction buffer stock and dilute an appropriate volume as needed with deionized water to 1× concentration.\nDilute ERK3 protein and each purified substrate in 1× reaction buffer such that 1~ul of each is used per reaction.\nPrepare 0.5 mM non-radioactive ATP solution by diluting stock ATP in 1× reaction buffer.\n## Assembly and Initiation of Kinase Reactions\nDetermine the volume of each component to be used such that the total reaction volume is 30 μl.\nAssemble reactions on ice by mixing all the components except for the ATP mix.\n## Preparation of ATP Mix\nPrepare sufficient ATP mix for the number of assays to be performed.\nStart the reactions by adding an appropriate volume of ATP mix to each tube.\nTake precautions for using radioactive isotopes, including appropriate shielding and monitoring of surfaces and personal exposure.\n## Incubation and Termination of Kinase Reactions\nIncubate the tubes in a water bath or sand bath at 30~^°C for 30 min.\nStop the reactions by adding 10~ul of 4× SDS sample buffer followed by boiling at 95~^°C for 5 min.\n## Gel Electrophoresis and Autoradiography\nLoad the entire volume of each reaction into a well of a 10-well polyacrylamide gel.\nRun the gel at 100-130 constant voltage and stop gel running when the dye front is about 1-2 cm away from the bottom of the gel.\n## Gel Staining and Drying\nStain the gel with a sufficient volume of InstantBlue Coomassie protein stain for 30 min.\nDry the gel in a gel dryer at 70~^°C for 60 min.\n## Autoradiography\nExpose radioactivity with X-ray film for an appropriate time.\nDevelop and fix the X-ray film to visualize substrate phosphorylation by autoradiography.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Biochemical & Molecular Functional Analysis"}}

Excisional skin wounds in rats (Figure 1)1.  Anesthetize the animal with an intramuscular injection with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (20m g/k g and 100 m g/ k g , respectively) or following the requirements from the local ethics committee.2.  Shave the dorsal region and gently remove two fragments from the skin using an 8 m m diameter circular biopsy punch (the distance between wounds should be approximately 1.5c m ). Note: This procedure should be handled carefully to not damage the muscular layer below the skin.3.  Measure the wound area immediately using a digital caliper and repeat the procedure on Days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after wound creation. Note: This time-course corresponds virtually with phases of skin healing processes.()Figure 1. Skin wound creation in rats. A. 8-mm diameter biopsy punch. B-C.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1853","title":"Immunoprecipitation and Sequencing of Acetylated RNA","text":"Immunoprecipitation and Sequencing of Acetylated RNA\n\n# Abstract\n\nGeneration of the epitranscriptome through chemical modifications of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has emerged as a new mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation. While most mRNA modifications are methylation events, a single acetylated ribonucleoside has been described in eukaryotes, occurring at the N4-position of cytidine (N4-acetylcytidine or ac4C). Using a combination of antibody-based enrichment of acetylated regions and deep sequencing, we recently reported ac4C as a novel mRNA modification that is catalyzed by the N-acetyltransferase enzyme NAT10. In this protocol, we describe in detail the procedures to identify acetylated mRNA regions transcriptome-wide using acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing (acRIP-seq).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

We used poly(A) RNA to specifically map acetylated regions in mRNA. However, this procedure can be extended to any RNA class of interest.2.  The steps described below are for one biological replicate. However, acRIP-seq should be performed in at least two biological replicates. A negative control consisting of ac4C-depleted RNA should be included. This can be accomplished by using poly(A) RNA from NAT1 O^^- cells (Arango et al., 2018).A.  Poly(A) RNA purification1.  For poly(A) RNA purification, we used two rounds of poly(A) selection using DynabeadsTM oligo(dT)25. Precautions should be taken to avoid ribonuclease contamination during the isolation procedure.2.  Resuspend 1.8mg of total RNA, obtained using the TRizol method (Rio et al., 2010), in 2.4~m of Nuclease-free H_2O at a concentration of 750u/ml . This amount of starting material is enough to obtain 20 u of poly(A) RNA.3.  Resuspend the Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 and transfer 1.2Omega_ml (6 mg) of beads to a 2.0m microcentrifuge tube.4.  Magnetically separate the Dynabeads using a magnetic stand.5.  Wash once with 1.2ml poly(A) RNA washing buffer.6.  Resuspend beads in 1.2ml poly(A) RNA binding buffer.7.  Pipette 600~ul of total RNA from Step A2 into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and heat at 75^°C for 2 min in a thermomixer set at 1,200 rpm.8.  Immediately add the entire 600~ul of heated RNA to 1.2~ml beads from Step A6 to achieve a total volume of 1.8ml .9.  Mix thoroughly and anneal through continuous rotation for 5 min at room temperature.10. Magnetically separate the Dynabeads using a magnetic stand and carefully remove the supernatant.11. Remove the tube from the magnet and add 1.2m poly(A) RNA washing buffer.12. Repeat Steps A10-A11 for a total of three washes.13. Add 600~ul of 10~m M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and heat at 75~^°C for 2 min in a thermomixer set at 1,200 rpm.14. Add 1.2 ml poly(A) RNA binding buffer.15. Mix thoroughly and anneal through continuous rotation for 5 min at room temperature.16. Magnetically separate the Dynabeads using a magnetic stand and carefully remove the supernatant.17. Remove the tube from the magnet and add 1.2m poly(A) RNA washing buffer.18. Repeat Steps A16-A17 for a total of three washes.19. Add 50~ul of 10~m M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and heat at 75~^°C for 2 min in a thermomixer set at 1,200 rpm.20. Quickly place the tube in a magnetic stand and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5~m~ microcentrifuge tube.21. Add another 50~ul of 10~m M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 to beads and heat at 75~^°C for 2 min in a thermomixer set at 1,200 rpm.22. Quickly place the tube in a magnetic stand and transfer the supernatant to the same tube from Step A20.23. Repeat Steps A6 to A22 for a total of four times using the same set of beads. This procedure will process 2.4ml of total RNA prepared in Step A2. After this step, the volume of poly(A) RNA will be 400ul .24. Add 40ul of 3M sodium acetate, pH.5.5, 3ul linear acrylamide, a coprecipitant to aid recovery of RNA during alcohol precipitation, and 1.1 m of 100% ethanol.25. Incubate at -20~^°C overnight.26. Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 20 min at 4^°C in a microcentrifuge.27. Carefully remove supernatant.28. Wash pellet with 750ul of 70% ethanol.29. Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 5:m i n at 4^°C in a microcentrifuge.30. Carefully remove ethanol.31. Air dry pellet for 5 min at room temperature to remove residual ethanol.32. Resuspend in 50~ul Nuclease-free H_2O .33. Evaluate poly(A) RNA quality using the Agilent RNA 6000 kit and Bioanalyzer (Figure 2A, top).Stopping point: Samples can be stored at - -80~^°C. .# B.  RNA fragmentationTo narrow the mapping of acetylated regions, input poly(A) RNA is fragmented prior to immunoprecipitation. The optimal fragment size range of RNA is between 100-200 nucleotides. This range of RNA sizes is achieved by divalent metal cations such as  M g^2+ or Zn^2+ at high temperatures. Divalent cations attack the z' hydroxyl group of ribose ultimately cleaving the RNA strand with no sequence specificity (Shelton and Morrow, 1991; AbouHaidar and Ivanov, 1999).1.  Mix 20u of poly(A) RNA in 180ul of Nuclease-free H_2O in a sterile PCR tube. This amount of poly(A) RNA will be split between IgG and anti-ac4C immunoprecipitations.2.  Add 20ul of 10× RNA Fragmentation Buffer from the NEBNext® Fragmentation Module.3.  For better performance of the fragmentation reaction, divide the solution into four PCR tubes (50 μl each).4.  Incubate at 94~^°C for 5 min in a pre-heated thermal cycler with lid set at 105^°C .5.  Immediately place PCR tubes on ice.6.  Add 5~ul of 10× RNA Fragmentation Stop Solution from the NEBNext® Fragmentation Module to each PCR tube.7.  Transfer the fragmentation RNA reactions into one 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add the following components: *We recommend the use of linear acrylamide rather than other co-precipitants such as glycogen.We have observed that glycogen can bind non-specifically to anti-ac4C antibodies.()8.  Incubate at -20~^°C overnight.9.  Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 20m i n at 4^°C in a microcentrifuge.10. Carefully remove supernatant.11. Wash pellet with 750ul of 70% ethanol.12. Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 5 min at 4^°C in a microcentrifuge.13. Carefully remove ethanol.# bio-protocol14. Air dry pellet for 5 min at room temperature to remove residual ethanol.15. Resuspend in 50~ul Nuclease-free H2O.16. Evaluate fragmentation efficiency and concentration using the Agilent RNA 6000 kit and Bioanalyzer (Figure 2A, bottom).()Figure 2. Bioanalyzer profiles. A.

In vitro transcription of acetylated RNATo evaluate acRIP efficiencies between different conditions, an in vitro transcribed acetylated mRNA is spiked into input RNA prior to immunoprecipitation. In vitro transcription is performed using the MAXIscript T7 Transcription Kit. We use a 177 nt probe derived from the mouse  -globin gene with a nucleotide length within the range of poly(A) RNA after fragmentation (100-200 nt). The instructions described below are for the 177 nt probe derived from the mouse  -globin gene.

Here, we describe a protocol for the analysis of vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses. For this purpose, cells of whole spleens obtained from vaccinated BALB/c mice were ex vivo stimulated with the antigen incorporated in the vaccine. Evaluation and characterization of vaccine-induced adaptive T cell responses was performed by assaying spleen cell proliferation through radioactive ^3H -thymidine incorporation and multiplex cytokine analysis of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNFα in supernatants from spleen cell suspensions. This protocol can be very useful as a starting point for assessing vaccine-induced memory T cell populations in pre-clinical studies.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Isolation of white-blood cells from spleen1.  Take the spleen from each vaccinated mouse at pre-determined time points under aseptic conditions. Note: The time points selected for the evaluation of vaccination-induced cellular immune responses vary according to the vaccination protocol followed in each lab. Usually, spleens are obtained at the end of vaccination protocol (i.e., 2 weeks post last injection) in order to detect the existence of antigen-specific memory and effector T cell populations.2.  Under a sterile biosafety cabinet, put each spleen into a Petri dish containing 5m of complete RPMI medium.3.  Using a circular motion, press spleen against the bottom of the dish with the plunger of a 5 ml syringe until mostly fibrous tissue remains (Figure 1).4.  Filter cells to avoid tissue debris by passing cell suspension through a 70um Nylon Cell strainer into a 15ml sterile conical tube (Figure 1).()# Figure 1. Representative procedure of spleen cells isolation5.  Wash the spleen cells suspension with complete RPMI medium by centrifugation at 350xg for 10 min at 4^°C .6.  Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 3m of ice-cold ACK to lyse red blood cells.7.  Incubate for 5 min at room temperature with occasional shaking.8.  Stop lysis reaction by adding complete RPMI medium to a final volume of 10ml .9.  Wash twice the cells with complete RPMI medium by centrifugation at 350xg for 10m i n at 4^°C .10. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5m of complete RPMI medium.11. Mix 10 to 20~ul of cell suspension to Trypan blue exclusion dye in an Eppendorf tube to a final dilution of cells of 1:10 or 1:20. Allow mixture to incubate about for 3 min at room temperature. Apply a drop of trypan blue/cell mixture to a Neubauer chamber. Note: Cells should be re-suspended in serum-free medium since serum proteins stain with Trypan blue and produce misleading results. Also, the final dilution of cells in Trypan blue dye depends on the approximate number of cells present. If the sample is not diluted enough, the cells will be too crowded and difficult to count. If it is too dilute, the sample size will not be enough to make strong inferences about the concentration in the original mixture. By performing a redundant test on a second chamber, the results can be compared. Thus, the aliquot should contain a convenient number of cells to count in a Neubauer. Usually, 1:10 final dilution of cells is suitable when a spleen is dispersed to a 5 ml RPMI.12. Count separately the unstained (viable) and stained (nonviable) cells under a light microscope. Note: Trypan blue exclusion test is based on the principle that living cells possess intact membranes that exclude certain dyes such as Trypan blue, whereas dead cells do not. Thus, a viable cell will have a clear cytoplasm whereas a nonviable will have a blue cytoplasm. Also, caution is needed to the time the cells are left with the dye since longer incubation periods will lead to cell death and reduced viability counts. For that reason, cells should be counted within 3 to 5 min of mixing with Trypan blue.13. Determine cells per ml by the following calculations: Cells/ml = average count per square x dilution factor ×10^4 Total cells = cells/ml x total original volume of cell suspension from which sample was taken Routinely, one mouse spleen gives about 1×10^8 splenocytes. Note: Splenocytes recoveries vary significantly with age, gender and strain of mice.14. Resuspend cells in complete RPMI medium- 10% FBS at a final concentration of 2×10^6c e l l s/ml .# B.  Proliferation assay1.  For the assay incorporate the following controls: a.  No antigen stimulation (negative control; splenocytes in complete RPMI- 10% FBS only). b.  Positive control with a lymphocyte mitogen (splenocytes with the mitogen Concanavalin A).2.  Prepare 2-fold dilution series on the antigens of choice in 15m conical tubes using complete RPMI- 10% FBS. The recommended dilutions are: 20, 10 and 5ug/ml .3.  Plate cells in a 96-well U-bottom cell culture plate. Consider 2×10^5 splenocytes per well (i.e., 100ul of splenocyte suspension). Each condition should be assayed in triplicate. Note: When using unfractionated splenocytes from recently primed mice, usually 1×10^5–5×10^5 cells are plated per well in order to have a significant proliferation assay. In this case, unfractionated splenocytes contain accessory cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells that serve as antigen-presenting cells of the added antigen as well as a source of secondary signals to responder T cells, thus enhancing their proliferative response.4.  Add 100ul of diluted antigens or ConA per well to a final volume of 200ul per well. Final antigen concentrations should correspond to 10, 5 and 2.5u/ mk for antigens and 3u g/ml for ConA.5.  To negative controls add 100ul of complete RPMI- 10% FBS.6.  Incubate for 72h at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 , 95% humidity.7.  Add 25ul of diluted ^3H -Thymidine to complete RPMI per well corresponding to 0.5uCi per well. ^3H -Thymidine should be added gently as a drop, without mixing in the well so as not to disrupt cell clusters (Figure 2). Note: arl^3H J_ Thymidine is a radioactive material. All the procedures need to be done with dedicated incubators, hoods and pipettes in certified laboratories. Consult material safety data for proper handling instructions and get training to work with radioactive materials.8.  Incubate for 18h at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 , 95% humidity. Note: Incubation time is dependent on cell number used.9.  Lyse cells and harvest their labeled DNA onto glass-fiber filtermats using a semi-automated cellharvester. Let dry filtermats at a dry oven for about 30m i n at 60^°C .10. Put filters into bags and add scintillation fluid with a disposable plastic pipette.11. Seal bags and count ^3H -Thymidine incorporation in a beta-scintillation counter.()Figure 2.

Proliferating T cell clusters are indicated by arrows. Magnification 20x.# C.  Cytokine detection1.  Dilute antigens in complete RPMI -10% FBS beginning from as described above.2.  Plate cells in a 24-well cell culture plate. Consider 4×10^6 splenocytes per well (i.e., resuspend cells so as 4×10^6 cells would be in 500ul of complete RPMI- 10% FBS). Each condition should be assayed at least in duplicate.3.  Add 500~ul of diluted antigens per well to a final volume of 1 m per well. Final antigen concentrations correspond to 10 u/ml .4.  To negative controls add 500ul of complete RPMI- 10% FBS.5.  Incubate for 72h at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 , 95% humidity.6.  Collect supernatants to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 2,330 xg for 5 min at 4^°C to remove cellular debris.7.  Collect cell-free supernatants into new Eppendorf tubes and store at -70~^°C until used.8.  On the day of analysis, thaw samples at room temperature. Measure cytokine production with the mouse 5-plex Luminex panel (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF- f a , IL-4, and IL-10) following exactly the outlined protocol in the Milliplex manual. Note: Avoid multiple (>2) thawing-freezing cycles since it would cause protein degradation leading to cytokine production underestimation.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1884","title":"Improved Mammalian Mitochondrial RNA Isolation","text":"Improved Mammalian Mitochondrial RNA Isolation\n\n# Abstract\n\nMitochondria have two sets of RNAs. One is encoded in mitochondrial genome, and the other that consists of imported RNAs within mitochondria and cytosolic RNAs associated with mitochondrial outer membrane is encoded in the nucleus. These mitochondrial RNAs play important roles in mitochondrion biosynthesis and signaling in and out of mitochondria. Isolation and analysis of mitochondrial RNAs can provide useful information on understanding the mitochondrial regulation of cellular processes. However, several ribonuclease activities have been found in mitochondria, which will degrade mitochondrial RNAs during the isolation process if they are not properly inactivated. Here, we describe an improved method to inactivate the ribonuclease activities prior to RNA extraction, and thus provide a reliable protocol to isolate mammalian mitochondrial RNAs for quantitative RT-PCR and other assays.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes (Quality Scientific Plastics, catalog number: 509-GRD-Q)\n2. 0.22um filter (Merk, Millex-GP PES, catalog number: SLGP033RB)\n3.

Sample pretreatmentNote: To examine sub-mitochondrially localized RNA, different treatments such as nuclease treatment or mitoplasting are needed. We focus here on inactivation of mitochondrial RNases. Other methods such as proximity labeling are also needed to separate mitochondrially localized RNA from RNA contamination from other cellular compartments.1.  Isolate mitochondria from tissue culture cells as described in Huang and Wang (2019) and measure mitochondrial protein concentration with a NanoDrop instrument after diluting 1~ul of mitochondrial sample with 19ul of 0.6% SDS. Transfer 200u of purified mitochondria (in 20ul of MitoPrep buffer) to a microcentrifuge tube and keep the tube on ice. Note: About 9x10^6 HEK293 cells could be harvested from a hbarO -cm cell culture dish of 90% cell density, for a yield of around 250 μg mitochondria.2.  Mix mitochondria with 100~uI of fresh lysis buffer and heat the sample at 70~^°C in a heat block for 5 min. Take out the sample, and let it cool down to room temperature (RT).3.  Add 1 μl of 1 m/m proteinase K to the lysate and incubate it at 37^°C in a heat block for 5 min.# B.  RNA extractionNote: Perform this part in a fume hood.1.  Add 400~ul of TRIzol and 200~ul of 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane to the pretreated lysate, shake the tube hard for 1 min, and then spin at 14,800xg for 5 min at RT.2.  Transfer the colorless fraction in the upper layer to a new microcentrifuge tube, mix with an equal volume of isopropanol and spin at 21, 000xg for 10m i n at 4^°C .3.  Discard the supernatant and save the RNA pellet. Add 600~ul of ice-cold 75% ethanol to the tube, gently turn it upside down for a couple of times, and spin at 21, 000xg for 5 min at 4^°C . Note: If a small amount of mitochondria (200 μg or less) was used, the RNA pellet might be very small and hardly visible.4.  Discard the supernatant and make the remaining ethanol as little as possible. Be careful to avoid losing the pellet.5.  Dry the RNA pellet in the laminar flow cabinet.# C.  RNA treatmentNote: If mitochondrial DNA would not interfere with downstream assays, DNase I treatment is not required and RNA pellets can be directly dissolved in nuclease-free water.1.  Dissolve the RNA pellet in 40~ul of 1x DNase buffer with 0.5ul of DNase I, incubate it at 37^°C for 10 m i n , vortex the tube, and then spin down the sample briefly. Incubate the sample again at 37^°C for 10m i n .2.  Add 0.4~ul of 0.5M EDTA to the RNA sample and heat the sample at 70~^°C in a heat block for 10 min to inactivate the DNase I.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Sample Pretreatment\n## Isolate Mitochondria\nIsolate mitochondria from tissue culture cells as described in Huang and Wang (2019).\nMeasure mitochondrial protein concentration with a NanoDrop instrument after diluting 1~ul of mitochondrial sample with 19ul of 0.6% SDS.\nTransfer 200u of purified mitochondria (in 20ul of MitoPrep buffer) to a microcentrifuge tube and keep the tube on ice.\n## Mix Mitochondria with Lysis Buffer\nMix mitochondria with 100~uI of fresh lysis buffer.\nHeat the sample at 70~^°C in a heat block for 5 min.\nTake out the sample and let it cool down to room temperature (RT).\n## Add Proteinase K\nAdd 1 μl of 1 m/m proteinase K to the lysate.\nIncubate it at 37^°C in a heat block for 5 min.\n## RNA Extraction\n## Add TRIzol and 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane\nAdd 400~ul of TRIzol and 200~ul of 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane to the pretreated lysate.\nShake the tube hard for 1 min.\nSpin at 14,800xg for 5 min at RT.\n## Transfer Colorless Fraction\nTransfer the colorless fraction in the upper layer to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nMix with an equal volume of isopropanol.\nSpin at 21, 000xg for 10m i n at 4^°C.\n## Wash RNA Pellet\nDiscard the supernatant and save the RNA pellet.\nAdd 600~ul of ice-cold 75% ethanol to the tube.\nGently turn it upside down for a couple of times and spin at 21, 000xg for 5 min at 4^°C.\n## Dry RNA Pellet\nDiscard the supernatant and make the remaining ethanol as little as possible.\nBe careful to avoid losing the pellet.\nDry the RNA pellet in the laminar flow cabinet.\n## RNA Treatment\n## DNase I Treatment\nDissolve the RNA pellet in 40~ul of 1x DNase buffer with 0.5ul of DNase I.\nIncubate it at 37^°C for 10 m i n, vortex the tube, and then spin down the sample briefly.\nIncubate the sample again at 37^°C for 10m i n.\n## Inactivate DNase I\nAdd 0.4~ul of 0.5M EDTA to the RNA sample.\nHeat the sample at 70~^°C in a heat block for 10 min to inactivate the DNase I.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Molecular Biology Techniques"}}

Paramount to the success of these models is the induction of experimental antigen sensitization, as indicated by the presence of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin E. The quantification of antigen-specific serum IgE is routinely performed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, the reproducibility of these in vitro assays can vary dramatically in our experience. Furthermore, quantifying IgE via in vitro methodologies does not enable the functional relevance of circulating IgE levels to be considered. As a biologically appropriate alternative method, we describe herein a highly reproducible in vivo passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay using Sprague Dawley rats for the quantification of ovalbumin-specific IgE in serum samples from ovalbumin-sensitized murine models. Briefly, this in vivo assay involves subcutaneous injections of serum samples on the back of a Sprague Dawley rat, followed ^24~h~ later by intravenous injection of ovalbumin and a blue detection dye. The subsequent result of antigen-IgE mediated inflammation and leakage of blue dye into the initial injection site indicates the presence of ovalbumin-specific IgE within the corresponding serum sample.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 1.5ml screw cap micro tube (SARSTEDT, catalog number: 72.703.600)\n2. 5ml screw cap tube (SARSTEDT, catalog number: 60.9921.524)\n3. 27 G×%^* 1 m Insulin syringe (Terumo, catalog number: SS-10M2713A)\n4. 26 G×%^3 needle (Terumo, catalog number: NN-2613R)\n5. 23G×1%^ needle (Terumo, catalog number: NN-2332R)\n6. 3 ml syringe (Terumo, catalog number: SS-03L)\n7. 5ml syringe (Terumo, catalog number: SS-05L)\n8. 80um syringe filter (Sartorius, Minisart®, catalog number: 16592)\n9. 45um syringe filter (Sartorius, Minisart®, catalog number: 16555)\n10. 96-well microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NuncTM MicroWellTM, catalog number: 260860)\n11.

Duplicate 55 μl PBS only samples are required as negative controls.2. A total of 8 individual experimental samples can be analyzed per rat, in addition to duplicate negative control samples.B. Male Sprague Dawley rat anesthetization1. Place male Sprague Dawley rat in an anesthetic induction chamber and anesthetize via isoflurane for approximately 3 min.2. Once sufficiently anesthetized, intraperitoneally inject the male Sprague Dawley rat with 4~ml 5.71% chloral hydrate solution using a 23G×1%^ needle and 5m syringe. Notes:a. This volume of 5.7% chloral hydrate solution will anesthetize an adult male Sprague Dawley rat (>10 weeks old) for approximately textit1h .b. The male Sprague Dawley rat has reached sufficient deep plane anesthesia when the pedal withdrawal reflex is absent or barely noticeable.3. Place a small amount of topical ophthalmic ointment on the eyes of the anesthetized rat to stop them drying out during the procedure.C. Subcutaneous injections of serum dilutions1. Place the anesthetized male Sprague Dawley rat on a warming pad and closely shave the entire back of the rat from the base of the neck to the hips.2. Using a marker pen, mark an 8×8 dot grid covering the entire back of the rat. Space the dots approximately 1 cm apart (Figure 1). Notes: a.

Include 2 additional dots below the 8x8 sample grid for duplicate negative control samples.3. Starting with the highest dilution (1:128), subcutaneously inject 50~ul of the sample under the first marked dot using a 27 G x ½” 1 ml Insulin syringe. Continue down the first row of dots injecting each of the serial dilutions. Note: Start injections from the right-hand side of the rat if you inject with your right hand. This will avoid disturbing the injection sites as you progress across the back (Figure 1).4. Subcutaneously inject the 7 remaining individual samples and the duplicate PBS negative control samples, as per Step C3. Note: Always use a new sterile syringe for each individual sample.5. Once all samples have been injected, cover the back of the rat in cotton wool roll and place back in the housing cage.6. Monitor the anesthetized male Sprague Dawley rat periodically until full consciousness is regained.()Figure 1. Representative diagram of steps performed in Procedure CD.

Place rat on its stomach and allow samples to incubate for 15-30 min .4. Following injection, subcutaneous serum samples that are positive for OVA-specific IgE will develop a blue color (Figure 2). Record the highest dilution for each individual serum sample that returns a positive indication.5. Once all data has been recorded, humanely euthanize the male Sprague Dawley rat by intravenously injecting 600ul of Lethabarb® Pentobarbitone sodium into the heart using a ^27G x ½” 1 ml syringe.()Figure 2. Extravasation of Evans blue detection dye indicating the presence of OVAspecific IgE in the serum sample. Subcutaneously injected serial dilutions of serum samples that contain OVA-specific IgE will become blue following the intravenous injection of an OVAEvans blue dye solution.

Besides being an intensively studied topic in academic research, sRNAs also hold a promise as clinical biomarkers. While the need for expressional profiling of sRNAs is growing, preparation of sRNA libraries for high-throughput sequencing (HTS) remains technically challenging, due to their small size. The common PAGE-based protocol is time-consuming and inefficient due to material loss, while gel-free protocols generate libraries of insufficient quality. To overcome these shortcomings, we modified the conditions of size-selection by Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) in a way that allows separation of nucleic acids shorter than 100 nt and differing in length by only 20 nt. Implementing the method for preparation of small RNA libraries for HTS resulted in QsRNA-seq, a gel-free, fast and easy-to-perform protocol, amenable to automation, generating very clean libraries that result in high-depth expression data. The protocol also utilizes Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) for reduction of library preparation biases and to quantify expression levels. QsRNA-seq provides an excellent solution to the growing needs for small RNA expression profiling for research clinical use.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

RNA origin: using this protocol we successfully prepared libraries from C. elegans, Drosophila, human, Arabidopsis and fungi RNA. Thus we assume it will work for other species as well.b.  Column based kits enable non-biased recovery of small RNA. Do not use protocols based on precipitation of RNA by isopropanol, as they result in a poor recovery of small RNA. In our hands, using either MiRVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) or Direct-Zol RNA miniprep (Zymo) resulted in excellent libraries.c.  Some kits, for example MiRVana kit (Ambion) allow extraction of either total RNA or of separated High molecular weight (HMW) and Low molecular weight (LMW) fractions. Using LMW as starting material results in cleaner libraries.2.  Measure sample concentration Note: We use Qubit Fluorometer, but NanoDrop can be used as well.3.  Estimate RNA quality by electrophoresis or better by Bioanalyzer/TapeStation Note: To avoid library contamination by degradation products of longer RNA types, use only high-quality RNA (as indicated by sharp non-degraded rRNA bands if evaluating by gel electrophoresis or RNA integrity number mathitR I N>8.5 if using Bioanalyzer/TapeStation).# B.  Ligation of 3^ -adapterNote: Ligation reaction between sRNA and 5’-Adenylated 3’-adapter is catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase 2 truncated in the absence of free ATP.1.  Combine in an RNase-free 1.7ml microtube()2.  Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times or by gentle vortex.3.  Incubate at 72^°C for 3m i n .4.  Transfer directly to ice for 2 min.5.  Spin down briefly.Notes:a.  If you are not limited by RNA quantity, start with 5 μg Total RNA or 0.5 μg of LMW RNA, but it is also possible to start with 1/10 and even 1/100 lesser quantities; we successfully prepared a library from 2 ng of purified pool of synthetic 22 nt oligo. For C. elegans 100 µl worm/egg pellet generates ~200 µg total RNA.b.  Excess of adapter promotes generation of adapter dimers. 0.5 μl of 100 μM ' -adapter can be used for 5 μg Total RNA or 0.5 μg LMW RNA. For lower starting quantities dilute both the ' -adapter and the 5? -adapter accordingly.c.  It is important to transfer the samples into ice immediately after the denaturation steps to prevent reformation of secondary structures.6.  Add to the sample()7.  Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times or by gentle vortex.8.  Incubate at 25~^°C for 1h .Notes: a.  T4 Ligase 2 truncated arrives with 50% PEG in a separate tube. b.  Add RNase inhibitor first to prevent RNA degradation.C.  Dephosphorylation (optional)This step is required only if small RNAs with triphosphate structures at the 5' -end are needed (instead of monophosphate), such as secondary siRNA in C. elegans and retroviral infection-derived miRNA in mammalians. RNA ligases are not able to ligate triphosphorylated 5' ends. RppH enzyme removes two terminal phosphates, generating monophosphate 5' -termini, which can then be ligated to the 5' -adapter.1.  To the ligation reaction add 1~ul of RppH enzyme (NEB, 5U/ul) .2.  Incubate for 30 min at 37~^°C .D.  1st SPRI-based size selectionNote: During this step molecules >6O nt, comprising longer RNA species, including tRNA, whether adapter-ligated or not, are bound to beads, while adapter-ligated sRNA (37-45 bp) and free 3 adapter (18 bp) stay in the supernatant. Following magnetic separation, the supernatant is transferred into a new tube while the beads are discarded.1.  Add 40ul of RNase-free H_2O to the 20~ul of ligation reaction for a final volume of 60ul .2.  Add 67~ul of Agencourt Ampure XP beads and 78~ul of 100% isopropanol, to obtain a final concentrations  of 7.5% PEG  and 38% isopropanol  (for  explanations  regarding  the concentrations of the crowding agents PEG and Isopropanol see Table 2 below).3.  Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times or by gentle vortex.4.  Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Place the reaction tube on a magnet stand and allow the beads to settle for 7 min.5.  Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.7ml tube (discard the beads). Notes: a.  Agencourt Ampure XP are paramagnetic SPRI beads in a solution containing 20% PEG.b.  Optimal conditions for size-selection depend on the length of the fragments being separated. The conditions above are optimized for separation of adapter-ligated sRNA (37-45 bp) from fragments >60 bp. If preparing a library from longer RNA or/and using custom adapters with a different length choose the optimum conditions for the 1st size-selection step using Table 2 from the appendix protocol below.c.  Beckman currently manufactures two types of SPRI beads: Ampure XP and SPRI-select. Both beads are in 20% PEG. SPRI-select is RNase free certified and pass more stringent Quality Assurance (QA), to ensure reproducibility, however, they are much more expensive. In our hands, both bead types produced identical results.d.  Since precision is important, avoid carryover.e.  Aliquot SPRI beads into 1.7 ml tubes to prevent contamination (1 ml beads suffices for 3 libraries).# E. 2^n d SPRI-based size selectionDuring this step adapter-ligated-sRNA (37-45 nt) are bound to beads, while free sRNA (19-27 nt) and 3^ -adapter (18 nt) stay in the supernatant. Following magnetic separation, the supernatant is removed and discarded while adapter-ligated sRNAs are eluted from beads.1.  To the supernatant from the previous step add 86~ul of Agencourt Ampure XP beads and144ul100% isopropanol, to obtain the final concentrations of 7.5% PEG and 51% isopropanol.2.  Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times or by gentle vortex.3.  Incubate at room temperature for 5:m i n .4.  Place the tube on a magnet stand and allow the beads to settle for 7 min.5.  Carefully remove and discard the clear supernatant.6.  Proceed according to wash and elution protocol below.7.  Elute in 19ul RNase-free H_2O .Note: Optimal conditions for size-selection depend on the length of the fragments being separated. The conditions above are optimized for separation of the ligation products from non-ligated sRNAs that are 19-27 nt long and 18 nt long mathit3: adapter. If preparing a library from longer RNA or/and using custom adapters of a different length choose the optimum conditions for the 2nd SPRI-based sizeselection step by using Table 2 from the appendix protocol below.F.  Wash and elution protocol1.  With the tube still on the magnet stand, add 500ul of 85% non-denatured ethanol (freshly made from 100% ethanol), without disturbing the beads.2.  Incubate at room temperature for _30s .3.  Carefully remove the ethanol without disturbing the beads and discard it.4.  Repeat the ethanol wash.5.  Let the beads air dry for 5 min. Aspirate residual ethanol and let it dry for additional 2 min. Make sure no residual ethanol is present before proceeding to elution.6.  Remove the tube from the magnet stand and add the desired volume of molecular biology grade RNase-free water directly on the beads.7.  Gently mix by pipetting the entire volume 10 times.8.  Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.9.  Spin down briefly.10. Place the microtube on the magnetic stand and allow the beads to settle for 2 min or until the supernatant turns completely clear.11. Transfer the desired volume of the clear supernatant containing small RNA into a new 1.7m microtube.Note: Always use freshly prepared 85% ethanol and keep the tube close during the protocol. Reduced ethanol concentration due to evaporation may result in detaching of short molecules from the beads.G.  Ligation of the 5' -adapterNote: Ligation reaction between 3’-ligated-sRNA and the 5^ -adapter is catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase 1 in the presence of ATP.1.  Combine()2.  Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times or by gentle vortex.3.  Incubate at 72^°C for 3m i n .4.  Transfer directly to ice for 2 min.5.  Spin down briefly.6.  Prepare the ligation mix:()7.  Vortex and spin down the ligation mix.8.  Add 11~ul of ligation mix to the tube with the small RNA sample.9.  Incubate at 37~^°C for 1h .10. Incubate at 95~^°C for _30s .11. Transfer directly to ice for 2 min.12. Spin down briefly.Notes:a.  Blocking oligo hybridizes with the free 3 ' -adapter, turning it into dsDNA, which is not a substrate for RNA ligase, thus preventing generation of adapter-dimer.b.  Samples are heated to 95~^°C to release the blocking oligo that might have annealed to the 3’- adapter bound to the small RNA. Free oligos will be removed by SPRI separation. If not released and removed, the oligo may compete with the reverse primer during the RT step and PCR reaction (the oligo is blocked, so no product will be generated, but the yield might be compromised).c.  Aliquot ATP to prevent its degradation. Thaw the ATP solution at the bench and not in your palm.H. 3^rd SPRI-based size-selectionNote: During this step 3-5^ ligated small RNA (64-72 nt) are bound to the beads, while adapterdimer (45n t) , free 5? -adapter (27 nt) and blocking oligo (18 nt) stay in the supernatant. Following magnetic separation, the supernatant is removed and discarded while the 3-5^ ligated sRNAs are eluted from the beads.1.  Add 20~ul of RNase-free H_2O to 30ul of the ligation reaction for a final volume of 50ul .2.  Add 68~ul of Agencourt Ampure XP beads and 64~ul of 100% isopropanol, to obtain finalconcentrations of 7.5% PEG and 35% isopropanol.3.  Mix well by gently pipetting up and down 10 times.4.  Incubate at room temperature for 5:m i n .5.  Place the tube on the magnet stand and allow the beads to settle for 10m i n .6.  Carefully remove and discard the clear supernatant.7.  Proceed according to the above wash and elution protocol (Procedure F).8.  Elute in 15ul H_2O .9.  Transfer 12.5ul of 3'-5' linked-small RNA to a PCR tube.I. Reverse transcriptionNote: The RT protocol below is compatible with qScript Flex cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta). If using another kit for RT follow the kit’s instructions. In our hands, Invitrogen Superscript III and Superscript II resulted in an inferior yield.1.  Add to a tube with 12.5ul of 3'-5' linked-small RNA:()2.  Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 6-8 times.3. Spin down briefly.4. Transfer to a PCR machine.5.  Incubate at 65~^°C for 5m i n .6. Cool to 42^°C .7.  Add to the sample at 42~^°C :()8.  Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 6-8 times.9.  Incubate at 42^°C for 60m i n .10. Incubate at 85~^°C for 5m i n .11. Cool to 10~^°C .12. Proceed to PCR amplification.Notes:a.  GSP Enhancer is a component of qScript Flex cDNA synthesis kit used for RT performed with specific primers.b.  Samples can be kept at -20~^°C for up to a week.J.  Pilot cDNA amplificationNote: The aim of this step is to determine the optimal number of amplification cycles. After the system has been calibrated, pilot PCR step can be omitted. In this case, perform the main PCR directly with the known optimal cycle number.1.  Combine in a PCR tube:()2.  Perform PCR for 23 cycles.3.  Pause the thermocycler after cycles: 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23; open the tubes without removing them from the cycler and withdraw 7ul for analysis.4.  PCR conditions:98 °C 30 sCycles 1-4 98 °C 10 s 50 °C 30 s 72 °C 15 sCycles 5-20 98 °C 10 s 64 °C 30 s 72 °C 15 s72 °C 2 min10~^°C holdNotes:a. The number of cycles can be raised if using small starting RNA quantities.b. Aliquot dNTPs to prevent freeze-thaw cycle degradation.c. RT product can constitute no more than 1/10 volume of a PCR reaction.K.  Pilot gel electrophoresisNote: Samples can be checked by TapeStation/Bioanalyzer instead.1.  Cast 3.0% agarose/TBE gel.2.  Load 5ul of each one of the withdrawn samples.3.  Run samples at 80 for 1.5h .4.  Take a picture.Notes:a.  Use Purple or Orange loading dyes (NEB) as they produce no UV visible bands masking the library.b.  Use TBE buffer instead of TAE, as it allows a better resolution of small fragments.L.  Evaluation of the PCR productNote: Evaluate the PCR products to determine the optimal PCR cycle number for the main PCR. The optimal number of cycles results in a clearly visible but not too thick/smeary product band and the best library/artifact bands ratio (for typical PCR results see Figure 1).Possible PCR products:()Note: Truncated primer-dimer originates from annealing of a reverse primer to one of random 8N sequences during RT or PCR. It lacks barcode and a part of the 8N sequence.()B. Library prepared from total RNA()A. Library prepared from LMw RNAFigure 1. Example of a Pilot PCR electrophoresis. A. Library prepared from 1~u of LMW RNA fraction extracted from C. elegans worms synchronized to L4 developmental stage was amplified for 11, 14, 17 and 20 cycles. B. Library prepared from 1u of total RNA extracted from C. elegans worms synchronized to L4 developmental stage was amplified for 14, 17, 20 and 23 cycles. Five µl of each amplification product was electrophoresed on 3% agarose-TBE gel. The sRNA Library product is indicated by a red arrow. The 130 bp library product is visible starting at cycle 11 in (A) and cycle 14 in (B). The upper 270 bp band originates from snRNA and the lower 93 bp band originates from truncated adapter-dimer. Based on these results the chosen number of cycles for the main PCR was 14 cycles for library (A) and 17 cycles for library (B).# M. Main cDNA amplificationPrepare PCR reaction as above and amplify with the predetermined optimal number of cycles. Note: If skipping the pilot PCR, take an aliquot after the amplification for quality check before proceeding to library purification.# N.  Cleaning PCR product# Notes:a.  Most contaminating bands, except for a primer-dimer, can be efficiently removed by a conventional double-side size-selection using SPRI beads in 20% PEG (for typical cleaning output see Figure 2).b.  A 105 bp long primer-dimer is inefficiently removed by SPRI beads. Low level of contamination by primer-dimer is acceptable, but in a case of a prominent primer-dimer band, we suggest cleaning the PCR product by gel-extraction.# Cleaning on SPRI beads1.  Removal of bands >200 bpa.  Transfer 50ul of the PCR product to a 1.7ml tube.b.  Add beads as follows: i.  For libraries predominantly contaminated with higher bands (x1.4V,x2.0V) , add 70ul . ii.  For libraries predominantly contaminated with lower bands (×1.2or,×1.8or) , add 60~ul .c.  Mix the total reaction volume by pipetting 10 times.d.  Incubate at room temperature for 5:m i n .e.  Place the tube on the magnetic stand and allow the beads to settle for 7 min.f.  Transfer the entire clear supernatant to a new tube (discard the beads).2.  Removal of bands <100 bpa.  Add 30ul beads to the supernatant from the previous step.b.  Mix the total reaction volume by pipetting 10 times.c.  Incubate at room temperature for 5:m i n .d.  Place the reaction vessels on the magnet stand and allow the beads to settle for 7 min.e.  Carefully remove and discard the clear supernatant.f.  Proceed according to wash and elution protocol above (Procedure F).g.  Elute with 20 uI H_2O .3.  Examples of sRNA libraries before and after cleaning are presented in Figure 2.Note: Cleaning a PCR product is performed by conventional double-side size-selection (using SPRI beads only) according to the SPRI based size-selection guide of Beckman-Coulter. At the first step bands longer than the library are bound to the beads, while the library remains in the supernatant and is transferred to a new tube. On the second step a new batch of beads is added to increase PEG concentration, the library is bound to the beads, while the shorter contaminants remain in the supernatant and are discarded. The volume of the added beads is calculated in relation to the volume of the nucleic acid solution. In order to clean the libraries contaminated predominantly by longer bands use 70mu l of the beads at the 7^s t step, which correspond to 1.4x volume of the 50 μl of nucleic acid solution (1.4x , and 100 μl (70+30) beads at the 2^n d step correspond to 2.O xV. In order to clean a library contaminated predominantly by shorter bands use 60 μl of the beads at the 7^s t step, which correspond to I.2x~V, while 90 μl (60+30) beads at the 2^n d step correspond to nabla1.8x V.()Figure 2. Removal of library contaminants by size-selection on SPRI beads. TapeStation traces of PCR products before (left panels: A, C) and after (right panels: B, D) cleaning using SPRI beads. Libraries were prepared from 5~u total RNA extracted from C. elegans synchronized to L4 developmental stage. Upper row (A-B): The major contaminant is 270 bp long constituting 65% of the total PCR product. Cleaning by double side size selection using 1.4× beads followed by 2.0× beads reduced the contaminant to below 10% . Lower row (CD): The major contaminant is 93 bp long constituting 30% of the total PCR product. Cleaning by double side size selection using 1.2× beads followed by 1.8× beads reduced the contaminant to below 10% . sRNA library corresponding peaks are marked by red arrows. Peak sizes are indicated. The outer peaks titled “Lower” and “Upper” are 25 nt and 1,500 nt molecular size markers, respectively.# Cleaning by gel-extraction (optional)Note: Clean by gel-extraction instead of SPRI beads in a case of a heavy contamination with primerdimer.1.  Cast 3.5% agarose or 3.0% low-range ultra agarose (Bio-Rad) gel in TBE.2.  Electrophorese sample at 80or for _2.5h .3.  Excise the library band and weight the slice.4.  Chop the slice finely (use separate razor for each library).5.  Extract using gel extraction kit. Note: In our hands, NucleoSpin gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and Gel/PCR DNA fragments Extraction kit (Geneaid) resulted in a satisfactory yield.6.  Elute with 15ulH_2OI elution buffer.O.  Final product validation1. Measure product concentration.2. Validate the library purity by TapeStation/Bioanalyzer.P.  Library storageOnce the library is ready for high-throughput sequencing (HTS), store library at -20^°C until use.Appendix protocol: Fine-tuning of binding conditions for different sizes of ligated moleculesSize selection conditions of the main protocol above are suited for ligation of 19-27 nt long small RNA to 18 nt long 3^ -adapter and 27 nt long 5' -adapter. As binding efficiency of a molecule is dependent on its size, if preparing a library from longer RNA molecules or if using custom adapters of a different length, adjustment of the conditions may be required for one or all size-selection steps.1.  Calculate the sizes of the fragments that are needed to be separated (see Table 1 for example)Table 1. Sizes of ingredients, intermediates and products of small RNA library preparation process  described  in  the  main  protocol  above.  Numbers  in  brackets  correspond  to predominantly miRNA libraries, such as in human.()2.  Determine the optimal separation conditions for the calculated sizes using Table 2.Table 2. Conditions for SPRI-based separation of short RNA molecules()The table presents approximate sizes of fragments that a given combination of PEG and isopropanol allows to separate, i.e., a minimal length of a longer fragment (that is bound to the beads) and the maximal length of a shorter fragment (that stays in the supernatant). Poor binding is defined as < 5% , efficient binding is defined as >50% . Note that the PEG concentration is always 7.5% and that the volume of RNA in H_2O is 50ul .# Examples of Table 2 usageExample 1: At the 3^ceild SPRI selection step of the protocol above we need to separate the 3-5^. - adapter-ligated sRNAs (64-72 bp) from adapter dimers (45 bp). According to Table 2 the suitable conditions, i.e., conditions that allow efficient binding of 64 nt long fragments and poor binding of 45 nt long fragments, are 7.5% PEG and 35% isopropanol. To obtain these conditions we need to bring the sample to a volume of 50~ul by adding H_2O and then to add 68~u20% PEG (beads solution) and 64ul isopropanol.If the RNA solution already contains PEG, the quantity of PEG needed to be added would need to be recalculated.Example 2: At the  SPRI selection of the protocol above, according to Table 2 we need to add 77ul of 20% PEG to 50ul RNA in water to obtain a final concentration of 7.5% PEG. However, the ligation reaction already contains 4~ul of 50% PEG, which equals to 10~ul of 20% PEG. Therefore, the amount of added PEG has to be reduced by 10ul ( 67ul instead of 77ul_. ), in parallel the volume of H_2O was increased by 10ul ( 40ul instead of 30ul ).Similar adjustments have to be done for both PEG and Isopropanol when cleaning the fragment of interest first from higher and then from lower bands (double-side selection).Example 3: At the 2^n d SPRI selection, for separation of the ligated sRNA from free adapter, 163ul of 20% PEG and 222ul isopropanol are needed to obtain a final concentration of 7.5% PEG and51% isopropanol. However, the sample already contains 77~ul of 20% PEG and 78~ul isopropanol added at the 1^st size-selection, thus only 86ul of beads solution and 144~ul~100% isopropanol are needed to be added.For each combination of PEG and isopropanol, binding efficiency of a fragment longer than the minimal length listed in the table will be higher, while that of a fragment shorter than the maximal length will be lower than the value appearing in the table. Better separation between the fragments can be achieved on the expense of recovery. Pure longer fragment can be obtained if using slightly lower isopropanol concentration, while pure shorter fragment can be obtained by double-side sizeselection if removing longer fragment at higher isopropanol concentration.Example 4: When separating 37 nt and 58 nt long fragments, to obtain pure 58 nt fragment perform binding with 38% isopropanol. At this concentration, some of the 58 nt fragments will remain unbound, but not the 37 nt fragments. In order to obtain pure 37 nt, first perform binding using 44% isopropanol. All 58 nt fragments and some of the 37 nt fragments will be removed from the solution. The remaining pure 37 nt long fragment is next recovered from the solution using 51% isopropanol. If wishing to obtain both fragments, perform the first binding using 41% isopropanol and the second binding using 51% . Upon these conditions, each of the fragments will be slightly contaminated by the other. For additional information see Fishman et al. (2018).# Testing binding conditions other than the ones listed in Table 21.  Calculate quantities of Isopropanol and beads (in 20% PEG) to be added. According to the equation:X+frac5P V100+fracQ V100=Vwhere,V is total volume X is volume of nucleic acid solution P is desired concentration of PEG sin% ) Q is desired concentration of (%) isopropanolA total volume of binding solution is equal to:V=frac100X100-5P-Qa.  Substitute P and Q for the desired concentrations of PEG and Isopropanol, respectively and X for the volume of nucleic acid solution (we recommend 50ul ) and calculate a total volume of binding solution (V) .b.  Next, calculate the volumes of beads and Isopropanol that are equal to 5PV/100 and QV/100, respectively.Measure binding efficiencya.  Prepare solution of 100 ng of synthetic single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide in 50 ul H_2O in a 1.7ml microtube.b.  Add beads and Isopropanol at volumes determined using the calculation method above.c.  Mix thoroughly.d.  Incubate at room temperature for 5:m i n .e.  Separate on a magnet stand for 7 min.f.  Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the beads twice with 85% ethanol according to wash and elution protocol. Elute in 20uI H_2O .g.  Measure oligonucleotide concentrations of the input oligonucleotide solution and the eluted sample by Qubit® Fluorometer using Qubit® ssDNA Assay Kit (Molecular probes).

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1966","title":"Isolation of Neural Stem Cells from the Embryonic Mouse Hippocampus for in vitro Growth or Engraftment into a Host Tissue","text":"Isolation of Neural Stem Cells from the Embryonic Mouse Hippocampus for in vitro Growth or Engraftment into a Host Tissue\n\n# Abstract\n\nFor both stem cell research and treatment of the central nervous system disorders, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) represent an important breakthrough tool. In the expanded stem cellbased therapy use, NSPCs not only provide a powerful cell source for neural cell replacement but a useful model for developmental biology research. Despite numerous approaches were described for isolation of NSPCs from either fetal or adult brain, the main issue remains in extending cell survival following isolation. Here we provide a simple and affordable protocol for making viable NSPCs from the fetal mouse hippocampi, which are capable of maintaining the high viability in a 2D monolayer cell culture or generating 3D neuro-spheroids of cell aggregates. Further, we describe the detailed method for engraftment of embryonic NSPCs onto a host hippocampal tissue for promoting multilinear cell differentiation and maturation within endogenous environment. Our experimental data demonstrate that embryonic NSPCs isolated using this approach show the high viability (above 88% ). Within a host tissue, these cells were capable of differentiating to the main neural subpopulations (principal neurons, oligodendrocytes,  astroglia).  Finally,  NSPC-derived  neurons  demonstrated  matured  functional properties (electrophysiological activity), becoming functionally integrated into the host hippocampal circuits within a couple of weeks after engraftment.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# A.

Set-up (general preparation)Note: All steps, including harvesting the embryos, are performed in a flow hood.1. Sterilization of the working area Expose the biosafety cabinet hood to UV light for 1 h before starting to use it. Wipe all working surfaces and the tools with 70% ethanol.2. Prepare the Matrigel-coated coverslips for cell cultures Dissolve Matrigel in a cold Neurobasal medium ( 10mg/ml) by pipetting up and down to mix the Matrigel and medium very well. Put a sterile glass coverslip at each well of a 24-well plate. Add the prepared mixture onto each coverslip in a volume of approximately 0.5 m per coverslip, making sure the surface of each coverslip is well covered. Keep coverslips for 40m i n at room temperature to let them be coated with Matrigel. Afterward, remove Matrigel and wash the coverslips with Neurobasal medium 3 times. Avoid letting the Matrigel-coated coverslips become completely dry after washing. Note: For monolayer cell cultures, prepare the Matrigel-coated coverslips at a 24-well plate. The number of coverslips/wells plated depends on experimental design and density of desired cultures and may need to be adjusted accordingly. Seeding cells onto glass coverslips is alsopreferable for the purpose of further immunostaining. Glass coverslips may be prepared in advance. In such a case, seal the 24-well plate containing the Matrigel-coated coverslips very well with parafilm. The Matrigel-coated coverslips should not be kept longer than for _24h .3. Polishing and sterilizing glass Pasteur pipettesPrepare the glass Pasteur pipettes by polishing the pipette tips over flame of an alcohol burner. To obtain pipettes with tips of various sizes, rotate each pipette slowly over flame from few to ten seconds until the glass of pipette tip’s edge become polished that can be visually seen (Figure 1). The smallest-sized tips have an internal diameter of approximately 0.2–0.3mm , the medium-sized–approximately 0.5–0.6mm , and the large-sized–about 0.9m m (Figure 1B). Before use, sterilize the flame-polished pipettes at 180~^°C for 12h .()Figure 1. Snapshots of the glass Pasteur pipettes with flame-polished tips of different sizes. The pipettes are used for mechanical dissociation of the cells from the fetal mouse hippocampi, starting using the pipette with the largest-sized internal tip diameter (from left to right on A and B).B. Harvesting embryos and dissecting the fetal hippocampi1. Sacrifice a pregnant female mouse at the desired stage (we use E16-E17) according to the procedures approved by your Institute.2. Wipe the abdominal skin with 70% ethanol and make a longitudinal incision to open the abdominal wall. Use another pair of sterile tools (forceps and scissors) for opening.3. Cut the uterus and carefully take the embryos out using a stereo microscope to visually control the procedure. If needed, use PBS to wash out the tissue. Place the embryos in a sterile 100 mm Petri dish containing a cold PBS (approximately 10ml ).4. Dissect out the brains from all embryos and carefully transfer to a 35~m m Petri dish containing 1 ml of HBBS. The dish should be kept on ice to ensure well-chilled medium.5. Very carefully dissect both hippocampi out of the brain by dissecting first the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum and splitting then the hemispheres either. For each of the hemisphere, remove the thalamus and very gently pull the hippocampus out of the brain with the help of a spatula.Note: To prepare a suspension of NSPCs containing approximately 1x1O^6 cells, take at least fiveto six embryos (ten to twelve hippocampi, at the developmental stage E16-E17).# C. Isolating NSPCs1. Take 0.5m of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to a 15ml Falcon tube and warm it in a C O_2 incubator (35^°C , for 20-30 m i n ).2. Enzymatic dissociation of hippocampal cells Transfer the isolated hippocampi into a warm 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate in a C O_2 incubator for 5-7 min. After incubation, stop the enzymatic digestion by adding Neurobasal medium in a volume of 1m (room temperature). Give a gentle flick to the tube containing the tissue to mix it up. Note: Each hippocampus may be cut to several parts using a sterile scalpel in order to facilitate enzymatic digestion of the tissue. Also, we recommend shaking the tube over tissue incubation period (2-3 times each minute).3. Mechanical dissociation of the cells Pipette the hippocampal tissue up and down using the flame-polished glass Pasteur pipettes. Start to pipette the tissue using the pipette with the largest-sized internal tip diameter first, followed by the medium-sized one. Finally, pipette the dissociated cells using the pipette with the smallest-sized tip. All steps are performed at room temperature. Note: Use each pipette for up and down pipetting not more than 10 times in order to increase the cell viability upon mechanical dissociation of the cells. Gently apply very small pressure to minimize cell damage while breaking cell aggregates. Avoid bubbles at any step of cell isolation.4. Take 5m of Neurobasal medium and add to the obtained cell suspension, gently mixing while adding the medium.5. Let the mixture of isolated cells in Neurobasal medium go through a 40-um cell strainer into a 50ml centrifuge tube.6. Centrifuge the obtained suspension at 200xg for 10m i n (room temperature).7. Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet intact. Add 10ml of Neurobasal medium to the pellet and gently resuspend it.8. Centrifuge cells at 200xg for 10m i n , as before (Figure 2).9. Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet intact. Add 1~ml of PBS to the pellet and gently re-suspend the cell pellet.10. Centrifugation in a density gradient a. Take 1 ml of the obtained cell suspension and transfer to the surface of 22% Percoll solution (total volume: 10ml ). b. Centrifuge the mixture at 450× g for 10m i n (room temperature). Remove the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet intact (Figure 2). c. Add 10ml of Neurobasal medium to the pellet and gently re-suspend it.11. Centrifuge the obtained NSPCs at 200xg for 10 min (room temperature). Remove the supernatant, add 1~ml of growth medium to the pellet and gently resuspend it. Note: Use a 1 ml pipette for mixing and resuspending the cell suspension. This minimizes cell damage and increases the viability of isolated NSPCs.()10 min at 450 g in 22% Percoll solution for NSPCfraction10 min at 200 g for NSPC pelletFigure 2. Schematic illustration of the main steps for NSPC isolation from the fetal mouse hippocampus through controlled enzymatic digestion and subsequent mechanical dissociation of the cells, followed by a number of centrifugation/resuspension stepsD. Testing the viability of isolated stem cells1. Trypan blue stainingOnce the suspension of NSPCs has been obtained, perform testing the cell viability using trypan blue. For this, take 20~ul of cell suspension and add 20~ul of 0.4% trypan blue solution to a droplet. Mix the sample well. Load the mixture into a glass hemocytometer very gently. Let the cells fill the chamber of hemocytometer by capillary action. Count the viable cells versus damaged cells (considering those brightly stained with trypan blue). It is advised that the proportion of viable cells shall to get over at least 75% .Note: For the assessment of cell viability, another dye can be else used. We probed propidium iodide, a commonly used red-fluorescent DNA counterstain, to mark dead cells in a population. This approach requires equipment for detection of the propidium iodide-mediated fluorescence.2. FACS-based analysisTake a suspension of the obtained NSPCs (approximately 5×10^5 cells) and resuspend it in 100 µl of BD Cell Wash buffer. Transfer the mixture to a flow cytometer and add 7-AAD (5~ul) . Mix carefully. Incubate the cells for 10m i n at room temperature. After incubation, perform analysis (we use BD FACSDivaTM 6.1.2 software). Typically, viable cells count up to 88% (see Figure 3). This confirms the high viability of embryonic NSPCs obtained from mouse hippocampi using the described protocol.()Figure 3. FACS-based analysis of embryonic NSPCs, freshly isolated from the fetal mouse hippocampi. A. Dot plot with gate of 7-AAD-positive non-viable (red) cells to show the proportion of dead cells after isolation. B. Distribution of viable (green) and non-viable (red) cells by morphology on the dot plot FSC vs. SSC. At least 5×10^4 cells were analyzed for each sample using BD FACSDivaTM software.# E. Growing embryonic NSPCs in a 2D culture1. Take the obtained NSPC suspension ( 1×10^5 cells/ml) and add 250~ul of FGF-2 (20~ng/ml) to the cells. We seed the cells on the Matrigel-coated coverslips at a 24-well plate by diluting the mixture to get the total volume of 50ml . Note: The total volume depends on the desired cell density (number of coverslips) to grow.2. To seed NSPCs in a 2D culture, take 0.5ml of the mixture and transfer the cells onto the Matrigel-coated coverslips at a 24-well plate. Note: For a 2D culture, seed NSPCs by distributing cells evenly across the coverslip surface, since cell aggregates dramatically influence growth and subsequent differentiation of NSPCs in a monolayer cell culture.3. Place the plate in a C O_2 incubator ( 35^°C,5%CO_2) and incubate for the next 24h .4. Next day, check the cell survival using an inverted microscope. At this point, change the growth medium (0.5 ml/well) (see Recipes) by gently aspirating the entire medium from each well containing coverslips with the cells.5. Change the growth medium every two days. While performing the changes, visually assess cultures for cell growth. We present an example of embryonic stem cells shortly after plating in a 2D culture (see Figure 4A). Undifferentiated cells can be confirmed by immunostaining for nestin, a specific marker of undifferentiated neural stem cells, showing typically up to 97% nestin-positive staining in 2D cultures (see Figure 4B).()Figure 4. Example images of embryonic NSPCs in a 2D culture. A. Transmitted light image of undifferentiated NSPCs isolated from the fetal mouse hippocampi shortly after plating in an adherent 2D culture (snapshot taken on Day 1 in vitro). B. Confocal image of immunostained NSPCs for nestin (green) and Hoechst 33342 (blue) staining. Scale bars, 30um .F. Passaging NSPCs in a 2D culture1. Passage the cells once NSPCs reach about 80% confluency.2. Aspirate all media from each well containing the cells at a 24-well plate. Gently wash the attached cells with a warm PBS (see Recipes).3. Take 200~ul Accutase (1x solution, thawed in advance at room temperature) and add it to the cells (each well of the plate). Incubate the cells with Accutase in a C O_2 incubator (at 35 ^°C ) for 5 min.4. Check under a microscope that cells are detached and then add 1~m of growth medium to the cells (to dilute/deactivate Accutase). Note: If cells are not detached after 5 min of incubation with Accutase, return the 24-well plate into a C O_2 incubator (up to 5 min), by checking every minute or two if the cells have detached.5. Collect the detached cells to a 1.5m Eppendorf tube and centrifuge the suspension at 200xg for 10 min (room temperature). Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 1 ml of growth medium. Note: Perform a check of the NSPC viability for each of the obtained passage (we use trypan blue staining, but another approach can also be used). Also, estimate the density of the obtained suspension before seeding the cells. If the density is higher than 1×10^5 cells/ml, dilute the suspension accordingly (typically, 1:2).6. Take 0.5ml of the obtained suspension and transfer the cells onto each of the Matrigel-coated coverslips in a 24-well plate for seeding the next passage of NSPCs. Note: We recommend seeding NSPCs in a 2D culture in the density at least 3×10^4 cells per coverslip, as we have established experimentally.G. Generating 3D neuro-spheroids by embryonic NSPCs1. Formation of the adherent neuro-spheroids (neurospheres) For the formation of 3D neurospheres take a suspension of NSPCs ( angle8×10^4 cells per coverslip) and resuspend the cells in the culture medium (without supplementing FGF-2). As we have observed  routinely,  removing  FGF-2  from  the  culture  medium  boosts  spontaneous differentiation of embryonic NSPCs and facilitates the formation of the adherent neurospheroids.2. Transfer cells onto the Matrigel-coated coverslips at a 24-well plate in a volume of 0.5 m per coverslip. Place the plate in a C O_2 incubator (35~^°C,5%~C( O2). Note: For the formation of adherent neuro-spheroids, coverslips need to be coated with Matrigel. There is no requirement to coat coverslips if experimental design includes formation of floating neuro-spheroids.3. Neurospheres will become forming within first 24-48 h after plating the cells. There is no need to change the culture medium during that period of time in order to not disrupt the formations. Neurospheres progressively grow over the time in a 3D culture. After 6-7 days in a 3D culture, embryonic NSPCs generate stable neuro-spheroids, which can develop up to 150-200 um (see Figure 5).()Figure 5. Typical neuro-spheroids generated by embryonic mouse NSPCs after 5 days in an adherent 3D culture. Scale bar: 50um .Note: We recommend not growing embryonic NSPCs in a 3D culture for over 9-10 days since 3D neurospheres facilitate spontaneous cell differentiation. At that time-point, 3D neuro-spheroids can reach above 300 µm that could promote cell death within the formation core. Therefore, it is strongly advised passaging NSPCs before 3D neuro-spheroids reach overgrowth.H. Immunostaining of NSPCs in 2D or 3D cultures1. Aspirate all the media from 2D or 3D cultures of embryonic NSPCs. Wash the cells with PBS (pre-warmed to room temperature) to remove dead cells and any debris.2. Add 500ul of 4% PFA in 0.1M phosphate buffer to each well containing the cells. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.3. Wash with PBS at least 2 times. Note: We recommend using 0.5 ml of the buffer to ensure sufficient washing. At this step, cells may be stored until proceeding with immunostaining (up to a week time). In such a case, seal the plate containing coverslips with the cells hermetically with parafilm to avoid drying and keep it at 4^°C .4. For blocking unspecific staining incubate the cells (or neuro-spheroids) in blocking solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA (see Recipes) for .5h at room temperature.5. Incubate with primary antibodies in antibody solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA (see Recipes) for overnight at 4^°C . We use 200ul of antibody solution per well. Note: Shaking the plate in a slow rate is useful (but not required) during incubation in blocking solution or with antibodies for facilitating the treatment.6. Wash the cells/neurospheres 3 times in PBS, each for 15m i n .7. Incubate with secondary antibody(ies) in antibody solution containing 0.5% BSA (without Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. We use 200ul of the solution per well.8. Wash 3 times in PBS for 15m i n .9. Incubate with Hoechst 33342 (1:5,000 in PBS) for 3-5 min at room temperature in the dark.10. Wash 3 times in PBS. Then wash in ddH2O to rinse out all salts. The cells/spheroids are ready for imaging.11. Imaging We carry out imaging of the immunostained cells on a glass slide. For this, mount the coverslips containing a 2D culture (or 3D neuro-spheroids) onto the SuperFrost® glass slides, using a mounting medium (ImmunoHistoMount). Then let the slides air-dry for overnight at room temperature. Keep the samples at 4~^°C . With such an approach, the immunostained cell preparations can be stored as long as needed. We present the example images for immunostaining of i) the adherent neuro-spheroids generated by embryonic NSPCs for both nestin and  -tubulin III staining (see Figure 6) and ii) an adherent monolayer of embryonic NSPCs for both nestin and Hoechst staining in a 2D culture (see Figure 4B). Staining for other proteins can also be performed using this method.()Figure 6. Immunofluorescent staining of neuro-spheroids generated from mouse embryonic NSPCs in a 3D culture. A and B. Confocal images of neuro-spheroids generated by embryonic NSPCs merged for nestin (green) and  -tubulin III (red) staining on Day 5 in a 3D culture. Scale bars, 50um (A) and 40um (B).I. Engraftment of mouse embryonic NSPCs onto organotypic hippocampal tissueSacrifice pups of FVB mice at P8-P9 according to the procedures approved by your Institute. Decapitate the animals, dissect out the brains and remove both hippocampi into a cold dissecting medium (see Recipes), as we have described above and previously (Rybachuk et al., 2017). Place each hippocampus on a tissue chopper disc, mounted on a tissue chopper (McIlwain), and initiate chopping to cut the tissue to the transverse slices of 350-um thick. Flash hippocampal slices into a Petri dish containing a cold dissecting medium and turn slices over to make their medial side faces up. Collect only hippocampal slices those have a well-recognized hippocampal-like morphology.Note: For ‘good’ slicing the tissue, we recommend to put a filter paper above the chopper disc and place the hippocampus on it to avoid slipping and wobbling the tissue by the blade. Also, remove excess medium around the tissue before initiating chopping.2. Organotypic hippocampal tissue culturesTransfer slices using a glass Pasteur pipette with the flame-polished large-sized tip (inner diameter of near 3m m ) onto a surface of 0.4um membrane inserts placed at a 6-well plate. We typically plate four slices on a 0.4um membrane insert. Remove the spare medium using a glass Pasteur pipette of a small-sized tip (inner diameter of around 0.8m m ). Add 1 ml of culture medium (see Recipes) to each well containing slices on membrane insert. Place the plate in a C O_2 incubator (35^°C,5%C O_2) . Change the culture medium on Day 2 after plating. Afterward, change the media every two days.# bio-protocolNote: A number of membrane inserts (wells at a tissue culture plate) depend on the amount of slices cut ‘good’ and may be adjusted from a 6-well plate to a 24-well plate.3. Engraftment of embryonic NSPCsTake 50~ul of a suspension of freshly isolated NSPCs and place the cells onto the surface of organotypic hippocampal tissue using a standard pipette (Eppendorf, Research® Plus). We grafted embryonic NSPCs onto hippocampal tissue at 7 days post-plating, but any time-point can be used. Any timing needs to be adjusted accordingly to experimental design. Transfer NSPCs by very carefully distributing the cells evenly across the tissue surface, not forming cell aggregates. Also, make sure that NSPCs settle exclusively on the tissue surface. Do not move the plate sharply to prevent the freshly engrafted cells drop down on membrane inserts. At Day 2 after engraftment, change the culture medium to wash out NSPCs not attached to a host tissue.Note: We recommend engraftment of NSPCs at the density of 0.25×10^5 cells per slice. NSPCs from 2D or 3D cultures may also be engrafted after careful dissociation of the cells to ensure homogeneous distribution across the surface of a host tissue.4. Growth of embryonic stem cells within a host organotypic tissue. Maintain organotypic hippocampal tissue with NSPC grafts in a C O_2 incubator (35°,5% CO2) until use. Change the culture medium every two days. Note: We recommend changing the culture medium by aspirating it under membrane inserts.5. Check the growth of differentiating NSPCs within a host tissue. This can be performed at any time-point due to simple tracing of the GFP-labeled NSPCs within the tissue. After 3 days, the grafted NSPCs began to incorporate into a host tissue (see Figure 7). Immunostaining in organotypic hippocampal tissue is performed similarly to the procedure described for cell cultures above and in our previous works (Rybachuk et al., 2017; Kopach et al., 2018).()Figure 7.

Our goal is to apply a technically simple approach for gene expression cytometry combining next-generation sequencing with stochastic barcoding of single cells. The BD Rhapsody Single-cell Analysis System was implemented to assess cellular heterogeneity present in 10 Dynabead-sorted human T cell samples. We captured and sequenced over 40,000 single cells across 10 samples. We used oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies and an immune targeted gene panel that utilizes multiplex PCR for detection of several hundred genes of interest. A combinatorial library of beads bearing cell- and molecular-barcoding capture probes was used to uniquely label transcripts. This allowed for reconstruction of the digital gene expression profile of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment without the need for robotics or automation. We demonstrate the ability of the BD Rhapsody targeted panel to distinguish six different cell types and 18 distinct gene-expression biomarkers, including CLEC4E, CSF2, IL1RN, TPSAB1, CCL19, CCL22, CXCL2, LAMP3, SPP1, and VMO. The BD Rhapsody targeted panel yields more sequencing depth with much fewer (<2%) sequencing reads per cell. The measurement of specific proteins and transcripts in individual cells is critical for understanding the role of cellular diversity in development, health, and disease.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Minimum of 75×75 paired read length with 20% of the PHIX control is required.2.  Sequencing depth is dependent on application. For cell type clustering, shallow sequencing is sufficient. For in-depth analysis, such as comparison across multiple libraries, deep sequencing is recommended. BD Biosciences recommends meeting the requirement for recursive substitution error correction (RSEC) sequencing depth of 6 in order to reach the threshold of sequencing saturation where most molecules of the library have been recovered. RSEC sequencing depth is reported by the analysis pipeline. The actual sequencing reads/cell required to achieve this depth can vary, because it depends on the chosen gene panel, number of cells, and sequencing run quality.3.  For the Sample Tag library, pool samples of the same type: ≥ 120 reads/cell.4.  Illumina HiSeq 4000 is used for the sequencing.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Priming the BD Rhapsody Cartridge\nEnsure an air-tight seal with the BD Rhapsody P1200M or P5000M pipette by holding the pipette and

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-1999","title":"Heterochronic Phenotype Analysis of Hypodermal Seam Cells in Caenorhabditis elegans","text":"Heterochronic Phenotype Analysis of Hypodermal Seam Cells in Caenorhabditis elegans\n\n# Abstract\n\nHeterochrony refers to changes in the timing of developmental events, and it is precisely regulated in the organisms by the heterochronic genes such as C. elegans lin-4 and let-7. Mutations in these genes cause precocious or retarded development of certain cell lineages. With well-defined cell lineages, C. elegans is one of the best model systems to study heterochronic genes, since the subtle changes in the development of cell lineages can be easily identified. Among the different cell types in C. elegans, hypodermal seam cells and their lineages are well known to be maintained by lin-14, whose expression level is regulated by two miRNA genes, lin-4 and let-7, at the larval stages. Therefore, analyzing the heterochronic phenotype of hypodermal seam cells in C. elegans could yield detailed insights into the status of the miRNA pathway.

The development of new genetic tags, such as the ascorbate peroxidase, APEX, for electron microscopic detection of tagged proteins has expanded the available toolbox and ushered in a new era in biological electron microscopy. Here, we describe methods for combining conditionally-stable nanobodies to fluorescent protein tags with APEX-based detection. These methods are compatible with detection of low levels of expression of fluorescently-tagged proteins and with detection of protein complexes using split GFP-based complementation methods.

After trypsinization, seed cells onto TPP dishes to achieve a confluence of 60%-90% at the time of transfection (Figure 5).Transfect cells and incubate (3.5 h - overnight)Split cells and plate in dishes (overnight)Fix and perform DAB reaction, stain with Osmium, dehydrate (2.5h)Figure 5. Timeline of the procedure. The entire process usually takes four days, including an overnight incubation post-transfection. In highly expressing cell lines such as BHK, our most commonly used line, this can be shortened to three days by reducing the post-transfection incubation step. Expression level can be empirically determined by fluorescence.2.  Perform transfection using Lipofectamine 3000 with a 1:1 ratio of plasmid encoding csnanobody-APEX (Addgene 108874 or 108876), together with the following as required; plasmid encoding GFP- or mCherry-tagged protein of interest; plasmids encoding the putative interacting proteins of interest fused to the N- or C- terminal constructs of split GFP; appropriate control plasmids. To control for non-specific APEX labeling, as a minimum, we use one half of the split-GFP pair only (N or C) with the APEX-csGBP plasmid. Additional controls can be i) no transfection; ii) APEX-csGBP only; iii) known proteins that do not interact; iv) proteins of interest with the interacting domains rendered non-functional by mutagenesis (if this information is known, this is the ideal control). One microgram of each plasmid per 3 cm dish is used as standard.3.  Incubate for ^3h , and then replace the culture medium. Incubate for a further 24~h . Note that certain cell types require addition of exogenous heme for maximal APEX activity. If necessary add bovine hemin to a final concentration of 7 uM16h or more prior to fixation.4.  Remove the medium from the cells and wash 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 min each (note that all washes are 3 ml per dish). Fix in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 Mcacodylate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Wash three times in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (5 min each at RT). It is critical to perform the DAB reaction immediately after fixation. The DAB/cacodylate reaction and wash mixtures should be prepared during the fixation period.5.  Wash for 2 min in DAB/cacodylate wash mixture. Replace with DAB/cacodylate reaction mixture (containing hydrogen peroxide) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Wash 3 times for 5 min with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate to remove free DAB.6.  Post-fix in Osmium tetroxide solution for 2 min to convert the DAB reaction product into an electron dense stain. Wash three times each for 2 min in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and an additional three times in double distilled H_2O .7.  Perform serial dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol in a PELCO BioWave fitted with a PELCO ColdSpot Pro system at 250 W (40 s incubation in 30% ethanol followed by 50% , 70% , 90% and 2×100% ).8.  Serially infiltrate with increasing concentrations 25% , 50% , 75% and 2×100% ) of LX112 resin in ethanol in the Biowave at 250 W under vacuum for 3 min per step.Note: Dehydration and infiltration steps can be performed without the use of a microwave by increasing dehydration steps to 10 min each and resin infiltration steps to 60 min incubations with an overnight incubation for the final 100% step.9.  Polymerize at 60~^°C for 16-24~h~ . Separate the plastic tissue culture dish from resin embedded cells with pliers and prepare blocks for sectioning (Figure 6).()Figure 6. Resin embedded cells in blocks are separated from the plastic tissue culture dish (A) and mounted in the microtome chuck (B)10. Cut 60 nm sections using an ultramicrotome and a 45^° diamond knife. Place sections on EM grids (e.g., formvar and carbon coated triple slot grids).11. Image under the electron microscope at 80  k V, beginning at low magnification (×200) to find an area of interest before bringing in the objective aperture and gradually moving to a higher magnification as needed. For examples of staining, please see Ariotti et al. (2015).# Notes1.  The degradation of conditionally-stable nanobodies in the absence of their binding partners relies on efficient proteasomal degradation. The efficiency of proteasomal degradation is known to vary from cell type to cell type. We have also observed that in some cells a low level of residual staining for APEX can be seen in control cells (lacking GFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins) expressing conditionally-stable nanobodies. It is therefore essential that controls be always performed in parallel to establish the level of APEX-DAB staining in cells lacking the binding partners for the cs-nanobodies.2.  Heme is an essential cofactor for the APEX ascorbate peroxidase, and certain cell types require addition of bovine hemin to the culture media prior to fixation to enhance APEX2 activity (Martell et al., 2012). However, some cell lines contain sufficient free heme such that addition to the culture medium is not necessary. To date, we have performed APEX labeling on BHK, HeLa and Caco2 cells without heme supplementation and do not now add additional heme as part of our standard procedure.3.  Osmium tetroxide is acutely toxic, corrosive, and requires specialist disposal. It should only be used with appropriate containment (e.g., fume hood) and PPE (e.g., gloves), after checking institutional policy and the current MSDS.# Recipes1.

So far, identification of latently-infected cells has relied on activating cells to induce expression of HIV proteins which can then be detected. Unfortunately, this activation significantly changed the cell phenotype. We developed a novel HIV reporter, named H I V_G K O , that allows the purification of latently-infected cells in absence of reactivation. Indeed, latent cells can be identified by expression of the EF1a-driven mKO2 and lack of expression of the LTR-driven csGFP. This protocol can be used to study the effectiveness of LRAs (Latency Reversal Agents) in reactivating latent HIV in primary cells.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.

Production of HIVGKO viral particles in HEK293T cells Note: HIVGKO particles are produced after calcium phosphate transfection in HEK293T cells..  HEK293T cell culture a.  HEK293T cells are cultured in DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in 182c m^2 tissue culture flasks in ^20m medium. b.  For maintenance of the HEK293T culture, when approaching confluence (80%) cells, aspirate media, wash once with PBS, then trypsinize (0.05% trypsin) and plate cells after 1/12 dilution in complete DMEM, in 182c m^2 tissue culture flasks. HEK293T cells are split every 3 days. c.  One day before transfection, plate approximately 4×10^6 of HEK293T cells per 182~c m^2 tissue culture flasks in 18m of complete DMEM. Note: After thawing frozen cell vials, HEK293T cells are cultured for at least one week before transfecting them for virus production. In order to maximize viral particle production, HEK293T cells are never kept more than 4 weeks in culture. HEK293T cells should never be grown to 100% confluency as they lose their ability to be transfected.2.  Calcium phosphate transfection Note: Protocol below describes the transfection of cells plated in one 782 c m^2 tissue culture flask. To utilize the maximum space available in the ultracentrifuge, transfect about 15 flasks. a.  Remove all medium from the flask. b.  Add 17m of fresh DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) containing a final concentration of 25~uM of chloroquine (do not add on cells but, at the bottom of the flask–Figure 1), slowly swirl the flask to distribute the solution evenly and, incubate for 30-60 min before transfection. c.  Prepare DNA mix in nuclease-free H_2O in a 15m conical tube ( 45u of H I V_G K O and 25u of HIV-1 dual-tropic envelope pSVIII-92HT593.1). d.  Add nuclease-free H_2O to the DNA mixture for a final volume of 1.5ml . e.  Add 1.75m of 2x HBSS buffer.f.  Vortex mixture at a medium-high setting while slowly adding (dropwise) 220ul of 2 M CaCl2 to the diluted DNA, and keep vortexing for about 45 sec.g.  Incubate at room temperature for 10-30 min before adding the prepared DNA solution to the bottom of the flask.h.  Slowly swirl the flask to distribute the solution evenly.i.  Culture for 6-8h at 37~^°C .j.  Remove supernatant.k.  Add 17~ml of DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) medium (add at the bottom of the flask, as shown in Figure 1, to avoid detaching cells).l.  Incubate for 48h at 37~^°C to allow viral production.m. Collect the supernatant into a 50ml Falcon tube.n.  Centrifuge for 20 min at 800xg at RT or 4^°C .o.  Filter supernatant through a 50ml centrifuge tube filtration.p.  Transfer filtered supernatant into UltraClear Centrifuge Tubes (To avoid the collapse of the tube, make sure it is filled with at least 34 ml. –add media or PBS to viral supernatant if necessary to reach that volume).q.  Spin viral supernatant in the ultracentrifuge for ^2h at 100,000× g at 4^°C .r.  Pour out supernatant, dry as much as you can the inside of the tube and resuspend the pellet with 50~ul of cold RPMI (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) medium or FBS, make aliquots in 1.5m Eppendorf tubes and freeze at -80~^°C . Notes: a.  When scaling up the viral production, you should be able to see a pellet. Also, scale up the volume used to resuspend the pellet. Do not make air bubbles when resuspending the pellet and, pipet up and down at least 50 times. b.  Concentrated viral supernatant can also be titered and used fresh. However, even though the p24 content will not change, fresh versus frozen virus will give different infection outcomes, which will require different viral input to start with (described in Step C2).s.  Thaw one aliquot, make viral dilutions up to 10,000 to 1 million and, titer virus for p24 content using the FlaQ assay protocol (Gesner et al., 2014). Note: In addition of tittering p24 content of the virus with the FlaQ assay, I would recommend directly titering the infection rate of your viral stock on activated cells using 4 or 5 viral dilutions, before proceeding with big experiments. You want to avoid total infection greater than 15% .()Figure 1. Adding media to cells without detaching cells. Steps A2b and A2k require to add fresh media with and without chloroquine, respectively. First, aspirate media, and then add fresh media directly at the bottom of the flask to prevent detaching the cells. Once the media is in the bottom of the flask, slowly swirl the flask to distribute the solution evenly and place the flask back into the incubator.B.  Isolation of human primary C D4^+ T cells1.  Human primary C D4^+ T cells culturea.  Human primary C D4^+ T cells are cultured in RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) + 20 cup/ ml of IL-2 in tissue culture flasks or plates at a concentration of 5×10^6/ml , in a C O_2 incubator at 37^°C .b.  Half of the medium is replaced with fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ml of IL-2 every other day.2.  Isolation of human primary  C D4^+ T cellsNote: This protocol describes C D4^+ T cells isolation using the RosetteSep Human C D4^+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail. Any other C D4^+T cells isolation kit can be used, but the protocol might slightly differ. Always follow the manufacturer’s protocol.a.  Order fresh blood or LRC in advance to have it delivered on the day of the experiment. Note: One blood/LRC corresponds to one donor. Three donors should be tested at least, in two different experiments at least.b.  Transfer blood into a 50~ml Falcon tube (if using LRC, cut both extremities of the chamber with clean scissors and let the blood drops into the tube).c.  Add 1,hphantom0001,hphantom0001, of RosetteSep Cocktail to sample, incubate at RT for 20m i n , and mix sample by swirling the tube every 5 min.d.  In a new 50ml Falcon tube, add 10ml of Histopaque-1077.e.  Dilute sample with equal volume of PBS containing 2% FBS.f.  Slowly and carefully layer diluted sample on density gradient medium to minimize their mixing.g.  Centrifuge sample for 20 min at 800xg , RT, with brake off.h. C D4^+ T cells are contained in the white ring, below the plasma phase (Figure 2). Pipet the ring and transfer it to a new 50ml Falcon tube.i. Wash cells by filling up the tube with PBS containing 2% FBS.j. Centrifuge for 3 min at 800xg and discard supernatant.k.  If pellet appears red, resuspend pellet with 15~m of cold AKC lysis buffer (see Recipes), incubate for 2 min at RT.l. Fill the tube up to 50ml with PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum, centrifuge for 3 min at 800xg , and get rid of the supernatant.m. If the pellet is still red, repeat Steps B2k-B2l, if not, proceed to Step B2n.n.  Resuspend pellet ( C D4^+ T cells) with warm, fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ m l of IL-2.o.  Count cells using an automated cell counter or a hemacytometer.p.  Culture cells at a concentration of 5×10^6/ml (250 million cells are cultured into 185~c m^2 flat). Note: Isolated C D4^+ T cells are mainly resting and can be kept in culture as such for several days. Medium can be changed every 4 to 5 days.()Figure 2. Isolation of human primary CD4T+ cells by histopaque density gradient. A. Slowly layer the blood (containing the RosetteSep Cocktail and diluted to half with P B S+2% FBS) on top of histopaque density gradient. Centrifuge for 20 min at 800xg , RT, with brake off. B. C D4^+ T cells are contained in the white ring, below the plasma phase, but above the histopaque and red cell phases. Carefully pipet out the ring.C.  Infection of human primary C D4^+ T-cells with HIVGKONote: This protocol describes the activation of 250 million C D4^+ T cells using Dynabeads Human TActivator CD3/CD28. Any other human C D4^+ T cells activators kit can be used, but the protocol might slightly differ. Always follow the manufacturer’s protocol.1.  Activation of human primary C D4^+ T cellsa.  Vortex the Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 in the vial.b.  Transfer 3.125~m of Dynabeads (1 bead for 2 cells, which is half of the manufacturer’s protocol) to a 15ml tube.c.  Place the tube on a magnet for 1 min and discard the supernatant.d.  Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the washed Dynabeads with 10ml of the C D4^+ T cells to activate (at a concentration of 5×10^6/ml , and add those 10ml to the rest of the C D4^+ T cells to activate. Transfer the whole suspension to an appropriate vessel (5 millions of activated cells can be cultured in one well of a 24-well plate).e.  Culture in a C O_2 incubator at 37^°C for three days as such (you should see cells aggregates due to activation).2.  Infection of human primary C D4^+ T cells with H I V_G K ONote: The spin-infection of 1 million activated C D4^+ tau cells requires 30 μl of a 10,000 ng p24^G a g/m I viral dilution to reach a total infection rate of 9%-12% (to keep the ratios of latent versus productive infections consistent, avoid infection rates greater than 15% ). However, the total infection rate (productive ^+ latent infections) might slightly change according to fresh versus frozen stocks, viral stocks themselves and donors. Thus, in addition of titering the virus with the FlaQ assay, I would recommend directly titering your viral stock on activated cells using 4 or 5 viral dilutions, before proceeding with big experiments. Using frozen viral stocks requires the use of bigger amount of virus to reach 9%-12% infection rate.a.  Three days post-activation, mix cells and beads and, transfer cells to 15ml tubes.b.  Place the tube on a magnet for 1 min and transfer the supernatant into a new 50ml tube.c.  Centrifuge cells for 3 min at RT at 800xg .d.  Discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet of 250 million cells with media containing the viral preparation at 10,000n gp24^G a g/ml .e.  Transfer resuspended cells to a pipetting reservoir and distribute 30~ul of the cells/virus suspension per one well of a 96 well V-bottom plate using a multi-channel pipetman.f.  Centrifuge stackrel= spin-infection) the plate for ^2h , at 800xg , 32^°C .g.  Add 100ul of fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ml of IL-2 in each well and pool cells back together. Resuspend cells in a final volume of 100m of fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ml of IL-2 and, transfer into a 182c m^2 flask. Note: Viral solution stays in, but it is possible to wash it away after spin-infection.h.  Culture as such for 4 to 5 days in a C O_2 incubator at 37^°C .i.  Replace half of the medium by centrifuging down cells, with fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ m l of IL-2 every other day.# D.  Sorting cells1.  Five days post-infection, collect and transfer cells to 50ml tubes.2.  Centrifuge cells for 3 min at RT at 800xg .3.  Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in ^2m of FACS buffer (see Recipes).4.  Pipette resuspended cells through a 5m l35um cell strainer capped tube and place on ice.5.  Prepare several 15m collection tubes with ^2m of FBS and place on ice. Do not forget to label your tubes.6.  Then proceed directly to cell sorting using the flow cytometer FACS AriaII (PE channel for mKO2, and FITC channel for GFP) (see Figure 3 for gating strategy). Note: The sort can take up to 10h_i , thus sort cells at 4~^°C . Use the 85 μm nozzle to prevent spontaneous reactivation of latently infected cells. When collecting populations into 15 ml tubes, you can only collect 2 different populations at once. Keep sorting the latent population at all time, and exchange tubes for uninfected and productively infected cells when you have reached 5 million cells per population. You should be able to collect 1.5-2.5 million latently infected cells depending on your infection rate.7.  Spin down sorted cells for 3 min at RT, 800xg .8.  Resuspend cell populations with fresh RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +20cup/ml of IL-2 and, distribute equally into a 96-well V-bottom plate. Note: To test 5 LRAs, sorted populations should be divided equally into 5 wells. Given that each well contains 200 μl, the pellet should be resuspended in 1 ml final of RPMI media. Note that a few hundred thousand cells/well are enough to assay LRAs activity.9.  Let cells rest overnight in a C O_2 incubator at 37~^°C .# E.  Drug treatment1.  After ^24h incubation, prepare 2x LRAs dilutions (dilute drugs with complete RPMI).2.  Remove 100ul of medium from each well and add 100ul of _2× concentrated LRAs dilutions.3.  Incubate for ^24h in a C O_2 incubator at 37~^°C .F.  Analysis of LRAs efficacy by flow cytometry1.  Twenty-four hours later, remove all medium from wells, and wash with FACS buffer.2.  Spin down cells for 3 min at RT, 800xg and discard supernatant.3.  Stain cells with live/dead violet marker (1/1,000 dilution of the marker in FACS buffer, 100 μl/well, incubate for 10-15 min on ice in the dark). Note: Live/dead violet marker is perfect since it does not overlap with FITC and PE channels, and thus no compensation is needed.4.  Wash cells once with FACS buffer and, proceed directly to flow analysis (see Figure 4 for gating strategy). Notes: a.  Avoid fixing samples with PFA since it decreases fluorescence intensity.b.  For flow cytometry, AriaII sorter was used to run samples since fluorescence intensity is higher. However, other flow cytometers such as LSRII or Calibur are also suitable for these experiments as long as they have the right filters.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Production of HIVGKO Viral Particles in

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2195","title":"A Lentiviral Pseudotype ELLA for the Measurement of Antibodies Against Influenza Neuraminidase","text":"A Lentiviral Pseudotype ELLA for the Measurement of Antibodies Against Influenza Neuraminidase\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis  protocol  describes  the  rapid  and  safe  production  of  lentiviral  pseudotypes characterized  by  a  lentiviral  core  containing  a  reporter,  in  conjunction  with  avian  influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and human neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins on the surface. Production is optimized with Endofectin LentiTM transfection reagent in 6-well plate format. These pseudotyped viruses can be employed for serological assays of surface glycoproteins HA and NA. They can be efficiently used to perform the ELLA (Enzyme-linked lectin assay) to measure NA inhibiting antibodies in lieu of using reassortant virus or Triton X-100 inactivated wild-type virus as source of antigen, which may require higher biosafety levels.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Seed 4×10^5 HEK 293T/17 cells into each well of a 6-well plate. The right confluence for transfection is 70-90% the day after seeding. An example is shown in Figure 1.()Figure  1.  An  example  of  ready  to  transfect  HEK293/17  cells  (shown  at  x100 magnification), at around 70-90% confluence the day after subculture/seeding# Day 21.  Pre-warm DMEM ( 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) and Opti-MEM® to 37~^°C using a water bath or alternative.2.  Label two sterile 1.5~ml microcentrifuge tubes (Tube 1 and Tube 2) for every well of a 6-well plate.3.  Add 100 μl of Opti-MEM® to each Tube 1.4.  Then add the following plasmids to Tube 1: 0.5ug of phCMV-H11 (HA from A/duck/Memphis/546/1974 (H11N9)) 1 μg pI.18-NA (NA from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) or A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)) 0.75 μg pCSFLW 0.5ug of p8.91 Note: If transfecting multiple identical wells, DNA mix can be scaled up accordingly.5.  Add 100ul of Opti-MEM® and 3ul of Endofectin LentiTM for each microgram of plasmid DNA, to every Tube 2 (in this case add 8.25ul of EndofectinLentiTM).6.  Mix tube by inversion or by pipetting, then incubate at room temperature for 5 min (a thorough mix will help the combination of DNA with EndofectinLentiTM).7.  Transfer the Opti-MEM®/Endofectin LentiTM mix from Tube 2 to every Tube 1 and incubate at room temperature for 25 min. Gently flick the tube every 5 min.8.  During the incubation, take out pre-seeded 6-well plates from the incubator and remove the medium with an electronic serological pipette. Change the medium by slowly adding ^2ml offresh DMEM/ 10% FBS/ 1% P/S on the side of each well to avoid detaching the cells, after removing the spent medium. 9.  After 25 min incubation, pipette the DNA/Opti-MEM®/Endofectin LentiTM solution onto each well of confluent HEK293T/17 cells monolayer dropwise. Swirl the 6-well plate(s) gently to ensure even dispersal of transfection mix. 10. Incubate plates at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 overnight.# Day 31.  Pre-warm DMEM ( 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) to 37~^°C using a water bath, or alternative.2.  Check the 6-well plates under an inverted microscope. The confluence should be no greater than 90% . If cells are over confluent the yield will be suboptimal.3.  Gently remove the medium from each well and substitute with _2m l of fresh DMEM ( 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). Replenish the media with _2m l of fresh DMEM, taking care not to disturb the cell monolayer.4.  Incubate the plates at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 48 h .# Day 51.  The supernatant containing the viral pseudotypes is harvested using a sterile syringe and subsequently passed through a Millex-HA 0.45um filter.2.  Aliquot the supernatant as required and store at -80~^°C until downstream use. Note: The best condition for harvesting should be assessed after several attempts at PV production. The NA incorporation into P V can be accessed through western blot, and activity can be measured directly using the ELLA..  Influenza viral pseudotype titration using ELLA The Influenza viral pseudotypes contain both HA and NA and can be employed in different assays, such as pseudotype based microneutralization (pMN, Temperton et al., 2007) or ELLA (Prevato et al., 2015). In this section of the protocol, we will describe how the ELLA assay is carried out within the Viral Pseudotype Unit (VPU), according to the CONSISE consensus protocol (Couzens et al., 2014). Before starting the titration by ELLA, Maxi Sorp plates must be coated with fetuin. Briefly: a.  Coat Maxi Sorp plates by dispensing 100ul/well of a 1x Coating buffer with 25u/m l of fetuin. Note: 10x concentrate coating buffer should be dissolved in deionized H2O. b.  Seal the Maxi Sorp plates using a plate sealer and incubate them at between 2 and 8^°C for at least 48h . c.  Prepare a 1 N solution of sulfuric acid.# Day 11.  Prepare the Sample Diluent: DPBS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20. Note: Sample diluent is used as a blank and to dilute the viral antigen across the plate.2.  Prepare the wash buffer by dissolving one packet of DPBS-T (DPBS pH 7.4 with Tween 20) in one liter of deionized water.3.  Remove an aliquot of pseudotyped virus (PV) from the -80~^°C freezer and keep this on ice inside a laminar flow cabinet.4.  Prepare the materials to be used in the laminar flow cabinet: a.  96-well dilution plates (one for every ELLA plate required) b.  Pipette tips (1-20uI)/20-200uI/100-1,000uI) c.  Mono-channel pipettes of different sizes (P20/P200/P1000) and multichannel pipettes (either 8 or 12 channels, P200) d.  Waste disposal e.  Reservoirs f.  Fresh sample diluent5.  Add 120~ul of sample diluent from Column 1 to Column 12 to the dilution plate.6.  Add 120~ul of viral pseudotype (H11N1, or H11N2) to the wells in Column 1 for a 1:2 starting dilution.7.  Perform a two-fold dilution from Column 1 to Column 11 (e.g., move 120~ul from Column 1 to Column 2, mix, and then move 120ul from Column 2 to Column 3, etc.).8.  Take coated Maxi Sorp plates out of the fridge (2-8~^°C) , remove the plate sealer and remove the Coating buffer by aspirator pipette (or plate washer).9.  Wash the plates three times with wash buffer.10. Bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.11. Add 50ul of Sample Diluent to each well.12. Transfer 50ul of diluted virus to each well of the coated Maxi Sorp plate from the dilution plate.13. Seal the plate and incubate overnight (16-20 h) at 37^°C , 5% CO2.# Day 21.  Prepare the Conjugate Diluent with DPBS, 1% BSA.2.  Prepare the materials to be used in the laminar flow hood: a.  Tips of different volumes (1-20uvert/20-200uvert/100-1,000uvert) b.  Mono-channel pipettes of different sizes (P20/P200/P1000) and multichannel pipettes (either 8 or 12 channels, P200uI_: ) c.  Waste disposal d.  Reservoirs e.  Fresh Conjugate diluent3.  Take out the plates from the incubator, remove the plate sealer and wash six times with DPBS-T wash buffer, as reported in Steps B8-B9, Day 1.4.  Bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.5.  Prepare the PNA-HRPO solution by dissolving 1 mg of PNA-HRPO in 1 ml of Conjugate Diluent. Aliquot this accordingly and store them at -20~^°C .6.  Complete the Conjugate Diluent by adding PNA-HRPO to the sample conjugate at desired PNA-HRPO ratio. Note: Usually a dilution of 1:1,000 is sufficient. However, this can be optimized based on results to prevent waste of PNA-HRPO. If a plateau is reached at 1:1,000 dilution for the first few data points, the dilution can be increased accordingly.7.  Add 100 μl/well of the Conjugate Diluent containing PNA-HRPO to all wells of 96 well plates.8.  Cover the plates with aluminum foil (to avoid HRPO exposure to light) then incubate them for 2 h at room temperature.9.  Immediately before the incubation ends, prepare the citrate buffer by adding one tablet of citrate buffer to 100ml of deionized water.10. Remove the plates from the aluminum foil and wash them 3 times as reported in Steps B8-B9, Day 1.11. Bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.12. Prepare the substrate solution by adding 1 capsule of OPD to ^20mI of citrate buffer (cover the Falcon tube with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light).13. Add 100 μl of OPD substrate to every well of the 96 wells ELLA plates. Note: 10 ml of substrate solution is usually needed for every plate, meaning that 50 ml of citrate buffer is sufficient for 5 plates.14. Cover the plates with aluminum foil (to avoid exposure to light) then incubate them for 10 min at room temperature.15. Switch on the spectrophotometer and set up the following parameters: a.  Wavelength: OD490 b.  Reading speed: 0.1 sec16. Stop the reaction by adding 100 μl/well of 1 N sulfuric acid per well. This will prevent saturation of the wells.17. Insert the plate into the spectrophotometer and read.18. Export results as an Excel file. a.  Calculate the average of the blank values (background). b.  Subtract the blank average from all the values from Column 1 to Column 11.19. Open Prism GraphPad (in this case version 5 was used): a.  Open \"New tables and graphs\" and go on \"XY\", then select “Points and connecting lines” and enter 2 replicates values in side by side column and press create. b.  Copy and transpose the results from the Excel file on the Y-axis. c.  Convert dilution by Log2 to linearize the results and insert them onto the X-axis. d.  Normalize the data by using the highest OD490 value as 100% activity threshold, and the average of the blank as a 0% threshold (Figure 2A).e.  Perform non-linear regression to obtain a sigmoidal curve (non-linear regression curve fit, and select Variable slop) (Figure 2C) to obtain the final titration curve (Figure 2B).f.  In order to evaluate the 90% of the maximum OD490 as reported by Couzens and colleagues (Couzens et al., 2014), simply calculate the average of the highest OD for every replicate and insert it at the bottom of data section and normalize as described above.g.  Analyze by choosing the non-linear regression and select lines and straight lines from the list. Tick \"interpolate unknowns from the standard curve and choose 90% from the list\" (Figure 2C).h.  Reconvert the log2 number found to find the right dilution that corresponds to 90% of the maximum OD. Record this result as viral dilution factor to analyze sera through ELLA assay.()Figure 2. Evaluation of ELLA titre and its working dilution through Prism GraphPad. Results transposed are normalized (A) to identify a maximum and a minimum, then a curve is created by performing non-linear regression (B). The 90% of the average of the maximum OD from every replicate is then added to the data, normalized and successively identified on the curve by interpolating with a straight line. The result found red circle on the right side of (C) is reconverted to find the dilution that corresponds to 90% of the maximum signal.C.  Anti-neuraminidase antibody detection by ELLA assay Timeline: 4 days (including the coating)Once that the viral dilution factor has been calculated (in order to dilute the virus to 90% of the maximum signal obtained in the titration), it is possible to perform the ELLA assay. The protocol described by Couzens (Couzens et al., 2014) has been improved.Before starting the titration by ELLA, plates need to be coated with fetuin. Briefly:a.  Coat plate by dispensing 100 μl/well of 1x Coating buffer and 25u/m l of fetuin.b.  Seal the plates and incubate them at _2-8°_C for at least 48h .c.  Prepare 1 N of sulfuric acid.# Day 11.  Prepare the Sample Diluent: DPBS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20.2.  Prepare the wash buffer by dissolving one pack of DPBS-T (DPBS pH 7.4 with Tween 20) for every liter of distilled deionized water.3.  Take the sera out of the freezer, thaw them slowly on ice, leave at room temperature and successively heat inactivate them at 56^°C for 30m i n , by using a water bath.4.  Take out a viral aliquot from the freezer (-80^°C) and keep it on ice under the laminar flow.5.  Prepare the materials to be used into the laminar flow: a.  Dilution plates (one for every viral strain) b.  Tips of different volumes (1-20uvert/20-200uvert/100-1,000uvert) c.  Mono-channel pipettes of different sizes (P20/P200/P1000) and multichannel pipettes (either 8 or 12 channels, P200uI_, ) d.  Waste disposal e.  Reservoir f.  Fresh sample diluent6.  Add 120~ul of sample diluent from Column 3 up to Column 11.7.  Add 216 μl of sample diluent on Column 2 and add 24ul of each serum (1:10 dilution). Note: Initial serum dilution is up to the user. It could start with 240 μl of pure serum or with 120 μl of serum and 120 μl of sample diluent.8.  Perform a serial two-fold dilution by taking 120ul from Column 2 up to Column 11. Discard tips.9.  Take coated plates out of the fridge (2-8~^°C) , remove the plate sealer and remove the Coating buffer by aspirator pipette (or plate washer), or remove by hand inverting the plate on a big reservoir.10. Wash the plates three times with wash buffer and empty the plate as reported in the previous step.11. Remove all the drops on the top of the wells by applying some clean paper, then bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.12. Transfer 50ul of diluted serum from the dilution to the coated plate. Each row (serum) allow for a duplicate test.13. Calculate the amount of viral antigen needed for each plate (5mI) . Divide this number by the titer that corresponds to 90% of the overall signal (calculated as described in Step C7, Day 1) and dilute in sample diluent. Example: 10 p l a t e s=s50 m l of viral solution. If 90% of the overall signal corresponds to a dilution step of 25, we thus do 50~ m l/25=2~ r ml of viral solution (original thawed aliquot stock) in 48ml of sample diluent14. Add 50~ul of antigen solution to each plate from Column 2 to Column 11.15. Add 100ul of antigen solution to Column 1 of each plate (it serves as viral control VC).16. Add 100ul of sample dilution to Column 12 of each plate (it serves as blank).17. Seal the plate and incubate overnight (16-20 h) within the incubator (37°C,5%C O_2) .# Day 21.  Prepare the conjugate diluent with DPBS, 1% BSA.2.  Prepare the materials to be used in the laminar flow: a.  Tips for different volumes (1-20uI)/20-200uI/100-1,000uI) b.  Mono-channel pipettes of different sizes (P20/P200/P1000) and multichannel pipettes (either 8 or 12 channels, P200uI ) c.  Waste disposal d.  Reservoirs e.  Fresh conjugate diluent3.  Take out the plates from the incubator, remove the plate sealer and wash six times with DPBS-T wash buffer, as reported in Steps C9-C11, Day 1.4.  Remove the remaining liquid from the top of the wells by applying some clean paper, then bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.5.  Thaw an aliquot of PNA-HRPO.6.  Complete the conjugate diluent by adding PNA-HRPO to the sample conjugate. Note: Usually the best dilution is 1:1,000, but a proper setup should be established for every virus. A range from 1:500 to 1:2,000 usually allows for the best results.7.  Add 100 ul/well of the conjugate diluent containing PNA-HRPO to each well of 96-well plates.8.  Cover the plates with an aluminum foil (to avoid HRPO to be exposed to light) then incubate them for ^zh at room temperature.9.  Immediately before the incubation ends, prepare the citrate buffer by adding one tablet of citrate buffer to 100ml of deionized water.10. Remove the aluminum from the plates and wash them 3 times as reported in Steps C6-C7, Day 1.11. Remove all the drops on the top of the wells by applying some clean paper, then bring the coated plates into the biosafety cabinet.12. Prepare the substrate solution by adding 1 pill of OPD to ^20ml of citrate buffer (cover the falcon with aluminum foil to avoid direct exposure to light).13. Add 100ul of OPD substrate to each well of a 96 wells plate. Note: 10 ml of substrate solutions are usually needed for every plate, meaning that 100 ml of citrate buffer ensure the reaction for 5 plates.14. Cover the plates with an aluminum foil (to avoid reaction to the exposed to light) then incubate them for 10 min at room temperature.15. Switch on the spectrophotometer and set up the following parameters:a. OD490 b. Reading speed 0.1 sec16. Stop the reaction by adding 100ul/w e lvert of 1 N sulfuric acid.17. Insert the plate into the spectrophotometer and read.18. Export results to Excel file.a. Calculate the average of blank (background noise).b.  Subtract the blank from all of the values, Column 1 to Column 11.19. Open Prism GraphPad (in this case version 5 was used):a.  Open Tables and Columns.b.  Select “Points and connecting lines” and enter 2 replicates values side by side column, then press create.c.  Copy and transpose the results from the Excel file on Y-axis.d.  Convert dilution by Log2 to linearize the results and insert them on X -axis (Figure 3A).e.  Normalize the curve using the highest OD490 value as the maximum value 100%) and the average of the blank as the lowest value (0%) (Figure 3B).f. Analyze using non-linear regression to obtain a sigmoid curve (non-linear regression curve fit, and select Variable slope) (Figure 3C).g.  Check for the section “Data” for lCs_0 values (Figure 3D).h.  See Figure 4 for elaboration on the data and requirements for generation of antibody titer.()Figure 3. Analysis of the results (anti-neuraminidase antibody detection through ELLA) with Prism GraphPad. Insert OD values on the Y-axis and Log2 dilution on the X-axis (A), normalize results (B), analyse through ‘non-linear regression, curve fit, variable slope’ (C), then check and record the lC50 outcomes, highlighted in red circles, for “Normalize OD Data” (D).()# NotesAs with most manually performed serological assays, variation in results for the same experiment can be observed between members of the same laboratory, depending on user experience. To reduce variation, it is advisable to ensure lab members performing the ELLA assay have similar training and expertise in regards to use of multichannel pipettes and other standard lab techniques (pipetting, mixing of reagents). As there are multiple time-sensitive steps in this protocol, it is essential to keep to these timings between experiments. Two experiments carried out under even the smallest difference in timings may lead to different results.

The technique requires protein samples that are site-specifically equipped with a pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores.

Cell-free expression and incorporation of unnatural amino acids1.  Thaw DNA on ice (plasmid containing the gene of interest, with an amber stop codon and a cysteine codon in its sequence) (see Note 1).2.  Thaw the components of the cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) kit on ice.Two different options are described below. Either incorporate into the protein unique chemical groups that can be specifically labeled post-translationally (see Procedure A1) or directly incorporate fluorophores (see Procedure A2). A combination of the two methods can also be used, where one fluorophore is directly incorporated and the second fluorophore post-translationally reacts with a unique chemical group.# A1. Incorporation of pmbp -azido-phenylalanine (AzF)a.  Mix all reaction components in an Eppendorf protein low binding tube. Use the RTS 100 Site-specific Label Kit (Table 1) in batch mode (see Note 2).Table 1. RTS 100 Site-specific Label Kit reaction mix()b.  Place the tube with the reaction mix into an Eppendorf thermomixer.c.  Set the thermomixer at 32^°C and 900 rpm and let react for ^2h .# A2. Incorporation of fluorophores using precharged tRNAsa.  Mix all reaction components in an Eppendorf protein low binding tube. Use a customized cell-free system (Table 2) in batch mode (see Note 3).Table 2. Customized cell-free system reaction mix()b.  Add a fluorophore-charged amber suppressor tRNACUA and a fluorophore-charged tRNACys. The two fluorophores should constitute a FRET pair. For example Atto633-AF-tRNACUA and BODIPY FL-Cys- tRNACys (see Note 4).c.  Place the tube with the reaction mix into an Eppendorf thermomixer.d.  Set the thermomixer at 32^°C and 900 rpm and let react for ^2h .B.  Purification of protein with Ni-NTA and buffer exchange (see Note 5)1.  Add 50~ul magnetic Ni-NTA beads to a protein low binding tube.2.  Equilibrate the Ni-NTA beads by adding 200~ul of lysis buffer (see Note 6 and Recipes).3.  Use a magnet to hold the beads and remove the supernatant.4.  Repeat 2 or 3 times.5.  Add the 50~ul of the reaction and 150~ul of lysis buffer to the equilibrated Ni-NTA beads.6.  Leave for ^2h at 4^°C on a rotor (Stuart Rotator).7.  Use a magnet to hold the beads and transfer the supernatant in an Eppendorf tube(Flow-through).8.  Add 200~ul of wash buffer (see Note 6 and Recipes) to the Ni-NTA beads and vortex shortly(2-3 sec).9.  Leave for 10 min at 4^°C on the rotor.10. Use a magnet to hold the beads and transfer the supernatant in an Eppendorf tube (Wash 1).11. Repeat 2 times (Washes 2 and 3).12. Add 70ul of elution buffer (see Recipes) to the Ni-NTA beads and vortex shortly (2-3 sec).13. Leave for 10 min at 4^°C on the rotor.14. Use a magnet to hold the beads and transfer the supernatant to an Eppendorf protein lowbinding tube (Elution).15. Take a Zeba desalting column.16. Remove the column’s bottom and loosen the cap.17. Place the column into a collection tube.18. Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,500xg in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and discard the flow-through.19. Add 200~ul of the final buffer (see Recipes) or PBS (see Recipes) for further labeling of the sample.20. Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,500× g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and discard the flow-through.21. Repeat 2 more times.22. Transfer the column to an Eppendorf protein low binding tube.23. Apply the 70ul of sample eluted from the Ni-NTA beads.24. Centrifuge for 2 min at 1,500 x g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and keep the flow-through that contains the protein. The protein is either already double labeled (see Procedure A2), in which case can be used directly for smFRET measurements (see directly Procedure D) or it contains two orthogonal chemical groups, namely an azido- (from AzF) and a thiol-group (from Cys) (see Procedure A1), in which case they need to be labeled in a next step (see Procedure C).25. In the second case, measure protein concentration using a Nanodrop to calculate the concentration of dyes needed for the labeling.C.  Labeling with fluorescent dyes1.  Add to the protein sample (in PBS buffer) a 25× excess of the azido-reactive dye (e.g., Alexa647-DIBO).2.  Place the tube with the reaction mix into an Eppendorf thermomixer.3.  Set the thermomixer at 25~^°C and 300 rpm and let react for 15~h in the dark.4.  Prepare PBS-TCEP, pH 7.5 (see Recipes).5.  Degas PBS-TCEP buffer for ^2h in a vacuum pump.6.  Purify the single-labeled protein with magnetic Ni-NTA beads and size exclusion following the same procedure like before (see Procedure B). Use the degassed PBS buffer for the purification and elution of the protein.7.  Add a 20x excess of the thiol-reactive dye (e.g., Alexa488-maleimide).8.  Place the tube with the reaction mix at 4^°C for 15~h in the dark.9.  Purify the double-labeled protein with magnetic Ni-NTA beads and size exclusion following the same procedure again (see Procedure B).10. Elute the double-labeled protein with the final buffer.D.  Preparation of passivated microscope slides for measurements in solution1.  Place the microscope slides into a Coplin staining jar.2.  Prepare a Piranha solution (see Recipes) (see Note 7).3.  Carefully fill the Coplin staining jar with the Piranha solution.4.  Leave it under the hood for at least 1 h (see Video 1).()Video 1. Chemically clean microscope slides with Piranha solution5.  Fill three beakers with MilliQ water.6.  Hold the slides with tweezers and dip them from one beaker to the next to clean them.7.  Keep them in the third beaker (see Figure 1).()Figure 1. Cleaning microscope slides after Piranha treatment by dipping successively into three beakers with MilliQ water8.  Take the slides with tweezers, rinse them with methanol and dry with nitrogen flow.9.  Place the dried slides into a clean and dry Coplin staining jar.10. Prepare a 2% APTES solution in Uvasol acetone for silanization of the slides.11. Fill the Coplin staining jar with the APTES solution.12. Incubate for 10m i n .13. Take the slides with tweezers and rinse them first with acetone and then with methanol.14. Dry the slides with nitrogen flow and place them on a clean surface.15. Cut Eppendorf protein low binding tubes just below the 1 ml line (see Note 8).16. Smooth the cut edge using sandpaper (see Figure 2 and Video 2).()Figure 2. Use a tubing cutter to cut the tubes below the 1 ml line()Video 2. Cut and smooth Eppendorf tubes17. Apply optical glue on the rim of the cut tubes and place a single tube on one slide. Repeat with the other tubes on different slides.18. Place the slides with the tubes under UV light. The tube should touch the UV transilluminator, not the slide.19. Turn on UV light for 1-2 min to polymerize the glue (see Figure 3 and Video 3).()Figure 3. Slide with a tube glued onto it()Video 3. Gluing tubes onto microscope slides using UV light20. Prepare 100 mM NaHCO3 solution, p H8.3 .21. Dissolve 50mg PEG-NHS ester in 400~ul of NaHCO3 solution.22. Apply 80~ul in each tube to cover the surface.23. Close the tube carefully and keep the slides at 4^°C until use.24. Before use rinse the slides with MilliQ water, then methanol and dry with nitrogen flow.E.  smFRET measurements on a confocal microscope1.  Place 100~ul of double-labeled protein sample at a concentration ^2 nM inside the half-cut tube that is glued onto the slide.2.  Mount the slide on the confocal microscope.3.  Perform a Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) analysis for each fluorophore separately by exciting it using a 485~n m (for the blue dye) or a 640n m laser (for the red dye).4.  Determine the number of molecules N present in the confocal volume for the donor and the acceptor dyes, validate monomeric/non-aggregated protein, determine quantum yields (Kempe et al., 2015).5.  Dilute the sample respectively for the single molecule measurement to N=0.03 , to make sure that at any given time at the most one molecule is present in the confocal volume.6.

Grow rice plants under the following greenhouse conditions during the whole experiment - approximately 12~h of light, 28pm1^°C (day) and 25pm1^°C (night), and 75% relative humidity. Perform inoculation at the 2 to 3-leaves development stage (Figure 1), roughly 2 weeks after inoculation (WAI). Apply a suitable fertilizer to the soil for optimal growth.()Figure 1. Two weeks old IR64 plants, ready for inoculation2.  Use the following recommended rice varieties as checks: IR64, Bouake 189 or BG90-2 (susceptible O. sativa varieties); Azucena or Moroberekan (partially resistant O. sativa controls); accessions with any of the high resistance genes (RYMV1, RYMV2 or RYMV3; Thiémélé et al., 2010; Orjuela et al., 2013; Pidon et al., 2017) (resistant controls).3.  Propagate RYMV isolates on any of the susceptible control accessions – it is highly recommended to always use the same accession. Mechanically inoculate the plants (as described below) and harvest the leaves at 3 WAI when symptoms reach the 5 to 7 severity level (the symptoms severity scale is described below). Infected leaves may be kept at -20~^°C for several months or years.# B.  Inoculation1.  Cut the RYMV-infected leaves to be used as the source of inoculum into 0.5-1 cm pieces. Add Fontainebleau sand (about 200mg to 1 g of leaves). Grind the mixture in a mortar with 0.1M phosphate inoculation buffer, p H7.2 ( 10ml of buffer to 1  of leaves) (Recipe 1; see Video 1). A minimum of 100ul of inoculum per plant is required.()Video 1. Preparation of RYMV inoculum from infected rice leaves2.  Add two pinches of carborundum and mix with a pestle.3.  Using gloves, rub leaves twice with ground inoculum as shown in Video 2. Keep at least 5 plants of the susceptible check variety as a non-inoculated control.4.  After 5 min, rinse the leaves with water to eliminate the excess carborundum (see Video 2).()Video 2. Mechanical inoculation of RYMV on rice leaves# C.  Symptoms observation1.  Observation for symptoms can start between 10 and 15 days after inoculation (DAI), when symptoms first appear on susceptible control plants. The date of appearance of symptoms can be monitored on each plant on a daily basis. Symptoms are observed on newly emerged leaves.2.  The symptom severity scale on the leaves (Figure 2) is derived from the Standard Evaluation System for Rice (IRRI, 2002) but does not consider a reduction in plant height and delayed flowering:  Leaves green (no apparent symptoms);z= Leaves green but with sparse dots or streaks;5= Leaves green or pale green with mottling;7= Leaves pale yellow or yellow;9= Leaves turn orange or show necrosis and sometimes die.()Figure 2.

The samples can be used fresh, rapidly frozen at -20~^°C , or dried in a herbarium.For sample preparation with tissue lyser (QIAGEN), place 25 mg of fresh material (or 10m g of dried material) in a ^2mI tube with a metal bead. Put the tubes in liquid nitrogen for 5 min. Grind in tissue lyser for 30 sec at an oscillation frequency of 30H z . Add 500~ul of 1× PBST. Vortex vigorously. Alternatively, grind the same quantity of samples with pestle and mortar with 500ul of 1× PBST and then transfer to a ^2mI tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 5,200 x g . Keep the samples for up to 24~h at 4~^°C or frozen at -20~^°C before using them for the ELISA test.1.  CoatingDilute antibodies directed against purified RYMV virions in the coating buffer (Recipe 2) to a concentration of 1 mu g/m l l gG or according to the dilution factor recommended by the provider. Add 100~ul of antibodies solution per well, except in the wells at the edges of the plate which should be filled to avoid edge effect.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2326","title":"A Bioinformatics Pipeline for Whole Exome Sequencing: Overview of the Processing and Steps from Raw Data to Downstream Analysis","text":"A Bioinformatics Pipeline for Whole Exome Sequencing: Overview of the Processing and Steps from Raw Data to Downstream Analysis\n\n# Abstract\n\nRecent advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have given an impetus to find causality for rare genetic disorders. Since 2005 and aftermath of the human genome project, efforts have been made to understand the rare variants of genetic disorders. Benchmarking the bioinformatics pipeline for whole exome sequencing (WES) has always been a challenge. In this protocol, we discuss detailed steps from quality check to analysis of the variants using a WES pipeline comparing them with reposited public NGS data and survey different techniques, algorithms and software tools used during each step. We observed that variant calling performed on exome and whole genome datasets have different metrics generated when compared to variant callers, GATK and VarScan with different parameters. Furthermore, we found that VarScan with strict parameters could recover 80-85% of high quality GATK SNPs with decreased sensitivity from NGS data. We believe our protocol in the form of pipeline can be used by researchers interested in performing WES analysis for genetic diseases and any clinical phenotypes.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe raw file (fastq) is subjected to different steps such as quality check, indexing, alignment, sorting, duplication removal, variant calling, variant annotation and finally downstream bioinformatics annotation (Pabinger et al., 2014) (Figure 1). The pipeline is integration of tools, viz. bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), samtools (Li et al., 2009), FastQC (Andrews, 2010), VarScan (Koboldt et al., 2012) and bcftools (Li et al., 2009), apart from necessary files containing the human genome (Venter et al., 2001), alignment indices (Trapnell and Salzberg, 2009), known variant databases (Sherry et al., 2001; Landrum et al., 2014; Auton et al., 2015). A workflow of given pipeline is shown in Figure 1. In view of the fact that the benchmark metrics for pipelines is an essential step, we have ensured that our pipeline is benchmarked on a sample fastq file taken from a human genome project. As the pipeline runs on Linux, all commands are case sensitive wherever used. Whereas this pipeline was run on a 64 GB RAM with 8 core CPUs in an Ubuntu operating system (14.04 LTS machine), this can also be run on a minimum 16 GB RAM machine based on the size of raw fastq file. A shell script (with an extension sh) was created with all the commands as detailed below.()Step 1: NGS Data pre-processingStep 3: Variant Prioritization()Figure 1. The pipeline involving three important phases, viz. preprocessing, variant discovery and prioritization of variants# A.  Preprocessing the raw dataQuality check: NGS data analysis depends on the raw data control as it provides a quick insight into the quality of the sequences. This will potentially reduce the amount of further downstream analyses with early identification of questionable samples. The ideal base quality scores for Phred (Cock et al., 2010) have paved the way for the best quality scores for GC content (ca. 50% threshold) and the nucleotide distribution across all reads. In our pipeline, we used FastQC (with default Phred =20 value) as it plots the read depth and quality score besides a host of other statistical inferences. 1.  ./fastqc ~/samples/sample1.fastqFastQC generates an HTML formatted report with box plots and graph plots for mean quality scores for sequences, read length and depth along with the intended coverage (see Figure 2).()Figure 2. A pictorial representation containing the box plots and figures of FASTQC run containing information on statistics, quality, read coverage, depth, yield, based per read call, etc.Indexing human genome using bowtie2: Bowtie2-build is used to index reference genome which works at high speed and memory efficient way../bowtie2-build -uuparrow0 indexes/references/reference.fq reference When the command is expedited, the current directory will contain six new files that all start with reference and end with .1.bt2, .2.bt2, .3.bt2, .4.bt2, .rev.1.bt2, and .rev.2.bt2. While the first four files are the forward strands, the rev files indicate the reverse indexed sequences.Alignment and post processing of alignment: Bowtie2 is used for short read alignment. What makes bowtie2 interesting is the use of very little RAM with accuracy and modest performance in indexing the alignment (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). The mismatch or any sequencing errors or small genetic variation between samples and reference genome could be checked using the following commands:3.  ./bowtie2 -x reference_filename -1 path/filename1 -2 path/filename2 > filename.sam Note: The -2 option may be omitted for single-end sequences. Bowtie2 aligns a set of unpaired reads (in fastq or .fq format) to the reference genome using the Ferragina and Manzini (FM)-index (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). The alignment results output in SAM format (Li et al., 2009) and a short alignment summary is written to the console. Samtools is a collection of tools to manipulate the resulting alignment in SAM/BAM format. SAM stands for sequence alignment/map format and its corresponding format is binary mapped format (BAM). SAM could be converted into different alignment format, sort, merge, alignment, remove duplicates, call SNPs and short indel variants; whereas the BAM and following indices (.bai) are used to view the index of the binary aligned sequences. The basic necessity of having the binary mapped files is to save the memory.4.  ~/samtools view -bS sample1.sam > sample1.bam Sorting BAM: A sorted BAM file is used for streamlined data processing to avoid extra alignment when loaded into memory. Whereas it can be easily indexed for faster retrieval of alignment, overlapping is needed to retrieve alignment from a region.5.  ~/samtools sort sample1.bam sample1.sorted Samtools sort is used to convert the BAM file to a sorted BAM file and samtools index to index BAM file.6.  ~/samtools index sample1.sorted.bam Pileup all samples: Samtools mpileup step is used to analyze multiple samples across all samples thus giving coverage to all mappable reads.7.  ~/samtools mpileup -E -uf reference.fa sample1.bam > sample1.mpileup# B.  Variant callingTo call variants from NGS data, VarScan among other tools provide heuristic statistical approaches, which give the desired threshold for reading depth, base quality, variant allele frequency and statistical confidence over other bayesian methods. VarScan uses SAMtools mpileup data as input and there are a number of options included for variant calling. For each position, the variants, which don’t meet the user input criteria of coverage, number of reads, variant alleles frequency and Fisher's exact test, P. -value are filtered out. This step is a prerequisite to identify those candidate mutations underlying the phenotype/disease.Germline variants: For germline variants, mutations that an individual inherits from their parents, or SNV calling VarScan mpileup2snp protocol is used.1.  java –jar VarScan.jar mpileup2snp sample.mpileup > sample.varScan.snpIndel calling: Detecting of insertion and deletion (Indels) is the second most abundant source of finding genetic mutations in human population in a reliable manner. VarScan mpileup2indels protocol is used to call indels. The sensitivity and range for calling indels are determined by the respective alignments.2.  java –jar VarScan.jar mpileup2indel sample.mpileup > sample.varScan.indelVariant filter: To get rid of false variants call and remove overlapping between SNP and indels, a filtering option is applied on the resultant variant calling files which provide SNV and indels with higher confidence. An option to generate readcount report can also be used with VarScan (see Table 1).Table 1. Variant calling pipelines and their respective arguments()3.  java –jar VarScan.jar filter sample.varScan.snp –-indel-file sample.varScan.indel –-output-file sample.varScan.snp.filter4.  java –jar VarScan.jar filter sample.varScan.indel –-output-file sample.varScan.indel.filter5.  java –jar VarScan.jar readcounts sample.mpileup.sam > sample.mpileup.readcountsContamination check: Once the BAM files and IDs are generated, we could end up checking whether or not the BAMids are error prone or contaminated across the samples using VerifyBAMID (Jun et al., 2012).C.  Downstream processing the filesVCF, an acronym for variant call format, is a popular format to store variants calling data as it stores both SNPs and indel information succinctly. While BCF is a binary version of VCF, the format can be written and read using BCFtools tool using the following commands:1.  samtools mpileup -uf sample.sorted.bam l bcftools view - > sample.var.raw.bcfWhile generating BCF file from BAM using samtools, -u is used for generating uncompressed VCF which can be piped as BCFtools designed for stream data and -f for the faidx-indexed reference file in the FASTA format.2.  bcftools view sametools.var.raw.bcf l vcfutils.pl varFilter -D 100> sample.var.flt.vcf3.  samtools calmd -Abr sample.sorted.bam ~/hg38/hg38.fa > sample.baq.bam4.  samtools mpileup -uf /h g38/h g38. fa sample.baq.bam l bcftools view - > sample.baq.var.raw.bcf Annotation and curation: Post processing the files, annotation and curation of the data followed by prioritizing the candidate SNPs/variants involves a great deal of user's discretion. There are a host of tools and annotation methods meant for this. Population stratification can be one such step in this process. While the 1,000 genomes dataset (Auton et al., 2015) or Genome Aggregation database (gnomAD) (see Reference 5) containing the datasets are already used to summarize worldwide population, estimating individual ancestries using ADMIXTURE would help researchers to (Alexander et al., 2009) project the samples. On the other hand, downstream bioinformatics annotation can then be supplemented to integrate the results with different pathway tools, viz. PANTHER (Mi et al., 2016) which assesses the ontology/pathways affecting the ‘mutated’ genes. This can be further supplemented by usage of assorted databases like Clinvar and dbSNP. In addition, global enrichment analysis and association networks using GeneMania (Warde-Farley et al., 2010) would allow creating and visualizing gene networks by evidence in pathways and genegene/protein-protein interactions (predicted and experimental).\n\n# Outline\n\n## NGS Data Pre-processing\n## Quality Check\nUse FastQC to check the quality of the raw data with default Phred = 20 value.\nGenerate an HTML formatted report with box plots and graph plots for mean quality scores for sequences, read length and depth along with the intended coverage.\n## Indexing Human Genome\nUse bowtie2-build to index the reference genome.\nCreate six new files that all start with reference and end with.1.bt2,.2.bt2,.3.bt2,.4.bt2,.rev.1.bt2, and.rev.2.bt2.\n## Alignment and Post-processing of Alignment\nUse bowtie2 for short read alignment.\nCheck the mismatch or any sequencing errors or small genetic variation between samples and reference genome.\nOutput the alignment results in SAM format and a short alignment summary is written to the console.\n## Sorting BAM\nUse samtools sort to convert the BAM file to a sorted BAM file.\nUse samtools index to index the BAM file.\n## Pileup all Samples\nUse samtools mpileup to analyze multiple samples across all samples.\n## Variant Calling\n## Germline Variants\nUse VarScan mpileup2snp protocol to call SNVs.\nFilter out variants that don't meet the user input criteria of coverage, number of reads, variant alleles frequency and Fisher's exact test, P-value.\n## Indel Calling\nUse VarScan mpileup2indel protocol to call indels.\nDetermine the sensitivity and range for calling indels based on the respective alignments.\n## Variant Filter\nApply a filtering option on the resultant variant calling files to get rid of false variants call and remove overlapping between SNP and indels.\nGenerate a readcount report using VarScan.\n## Downstream Processing\n## VCF and BCF Generation\nUse samtools mpileup and bcftools view to generate a BCF file from the BAM file.\nUse bcftools view to generate a VCF file from the BCF file.\n## Annotation and Curation\nUse assorted databases like Clinvar and dbSNP for annotation.\nUse pathway tools like PANTHER to assess the ontology/pathways affecting the'mutated' genes.\nUse GeneMania for global enrichment analysis and association networks.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Bioinformatics Methods"}}

Such studies have been performed to great effect in single-cell organisms such as yeast and E. coli (Schuldiner et al., 2005; Butland et al., 2008; Costanzo et al., 2010), but similar large-scale interaction studies using targeted reverse-genetic deletions in multicellular organisms have not been feasible. We developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based method for deleting genes in C. elegans and replacing them with a heterologous fluorescent reporter (Norris et al., 2015). Recently we took advantage of that system to perform a large-scale, reverse genetic screen using null alleles in animals for the first time, focusing on RNA binding protein genes (Norris et al., 2017). This type of approach should be similarly applicable to many other gene classes in C. elegans.

Autoclave\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  Creation of double mutantsThe generation of single mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 has been covered elsewhere (Norris et al., 2015). This protocol begins with two single mutant worms in which the genes of interest have been deleted and replaced by compatible heterologous fluorescent reporters. In this example, the reporters are myo-2::GFP (expressed in pharyngeal muscles) and myo-3::GFP (expressed in body wall muscles).1.  To create a male strain necessary for crossing, there are two options: a.  Cross 5 wild-type (N2) male worms (available from CGC) with 5 hermaphrodites of mutant strain #1 to create male progeny that are heterozygous for the mutation (verify by ensuring the males are fluorescent). b.  Obtain homozygous males of mutant strain #1 according to standard protocols (He, 2011a).2.  Cross males from mutant strain #1 with hermaphrodites from mutant strain #2 (see Figure 1).()Figure 1. Crossing strategy to create double mutant worms from individual single mutant strains. GFP is used to distinguish homozygous mutants (P0 and F2 panels, brighter fluorescence) from heterozygous mutants (F1 panel, dimmer fluorescence).3.  Pick a single cross-progeny hermaphrodite containing both GFP markers (both myo-2::GFP and myo-3::GFP) onto a new plate. These worms correspond to double heterozygotes (i.e., mutant1 /+ ; mutant2/+). Allow these hermaphrodites to self-fertilize.4.  To obtain double-homozygous strains, pick worms with brighter GFP expression coming from both promoters. On a good-quality fluorescence dissection scope, you should be able to tell a difference in brightness between a strain with one copy (heterozygous mutant) and two copies (homozygous mutant) of the GFP transgene (see Figure 2).Note: Alternatively, pick a larger number of worms to individual plates and determine double homozygotes as worms with progeny that are I O O% fluorescent for both transgenes.()Figure 2. Fluorescent brightness reveals mutant genotypes. Worms imaged in situ on NGM plates demonstrating that homozygous mutants (left) are noticeably brighter than heterozygous mutants (right).# B.  Competitive fitness assayThe competitive fitness assay (Figure 3A) provides a simple and relatively high-throughput method for assessing phenotypes of large numbers of mutants and can be performed immediately after strain generation.1.  Pick equal numbers of wild-type (N2) and mutant worms onto one seeded NGM plate (see Recipes). Note: We find that 4 staged L4s of each genotype (i.e., 4 wild-type L4s and 4 mutant L4s) on a 6 cm plate works best to support _2 generations of growth without starving out the plate.2.  Incubate plate at 25^°C for 5 days.3.  Under a fluorescent stereomicroscope count the number of fluorescent (mutant) worms versus non-fluorescent (wild-type) worms. We prefer to count from pre-defined locations on each plate (e.g., 50 worms from the middle of the plate, 50 from the periphery, and 50 from in between). Notes:a.  We recommend counting all hatched worms regardless of stage.b.  For ease of counting, worms can be treated with anesthetic or cooled at 4 °C for an hour or longer.()Figure 3.

After Illumina sequencing of the digested DNA fragments, an ad hoc bioinformatic pipeline extracts the information for further downstream analysis.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

The enzyme  -glucosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of azide-glucose to 5hmCs present in the gDNA fragments. Azide then reacts with a biotin conjugate allowing immobilization of the modified DNA on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Figure 1A). After end repair, Illumina P7 adapter ligation and nick repair, the captured DNA is incubated with the 5^°arrow3^ exonucleases lambda and RecJf. The lambda exonuclease digests one strand of the double-stranded DNA and stops when it encounters bead-bound biotinylated 5hmC, whereas the RecJf exonuclease digests single-stranded DNA that might result from digestion of unmodified contaminant DNA by the lambda exonuclease. After elution from the beads, the DNA is denatured into single-stranded DNA molecules. This is followed by second strand synthesis, ligation of the Illumina P5 adapter, PCR amplification and Illumina sequencing. Single end sequencing starts from the P5 adapter and identifies the location where the lambda exonuclease stopped digesting and its associated nearest hydroxymethylated CpG (Figure 1B).()B - Workflow for SCL-exo()Figure 1. Overview of the SCL-exo procedure. A. As a first step of gDNA chemical modification,  -glucosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of azide-glucose from UDP-6-N3-Glc to 5hmCs. Click chemistry is then used to add a biotin conjugate (DBCO-PEG4-Biotin) to the N3-Glc-modified 5hmCs. B. Flow chart of the SCL-exo protocol.# A.  Preparation of samples for Illumina sequencingWe highly recommend using RNA-free genomic DNA (gDNA) for the SCL-exo protocol. We purified RNA-free gDNA of interest by using the QIAGEN DNeasy kit and adding an RNaseA digestion step as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-free gDNA from any type of tissue or cultured cells can be used for the SCL-exo protocol. However, one should keep in mind that the global amount of 5hmC differs greatly between tissues, therefore the starting amount of gDNA required for SCL-exo might vary according to sample origin. When processing samples from different test conditions, we strongly recommend adding an identical amount of hydroxymethylated DNA standard in each sample after sonication. The number of reads covering this standard can then be used to normalize the SCL-exo signals between samples.1.  Sonicate 1 ug of gDNA of interest in 10ul of 10m M Tris, p H8 in a 0.65ml sonication tube using the Bioruptor Pico to obtain DNA fragments of around 300 bp. Sonication cycles should be set at 30 sec off/30 sec on. To ensure a proper and reproducible sonication, we recommend doing 3 cycles of sonication, then a short centrifugation, then again 3 cycles of sonication, then a short centrifugation and finally 4 cycles of sonication.2.  The sonication efficiency can be quickly checked by running a 100-bp DNA marker and 0.5~ul of sonicated gDNA (diluted in 19.5~ul water) in an E-gel EX Agarose Gel (2%) for 10 min. You should obtain DNA fragments around 250-300 bp.Note: The procedure Steps A3 to A12 come from our colleagues with minor modifications (Szulwachet al., 2012, Bio-protocol).3.  Mix the remaining 9.5~ul of sonicated DNA with: 2~ul of 10× NEB Beta-GT reaction buffer (supplied with the Beta-GT enzyme) +~0.68~ul of UDP-6-N3-Glc (3 m M)+1 uI NEB Beta-GT enzyme +6.8ul water.4.

Centrifuge quickly with the mini centrifuge (5 sec at 2,000× g ) and clean up the reaction with QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit. Elute with at least 30ul water per column. Note: The biotinylated DNA samples can be conserved at -20~^°C for few days.10. Wash 25~ul of Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin three times each with 100~ul of 1× Binding & Washing (B&W) buffer (see Recipes) in a 0.5 ml Lobind tube.

SCL libraries were obtained by omitting the exonuclease digestion steps. Note that DNA fragments from the SCL libraries are on average 100 bp longer than in the SCLexo libraries. B. BioAnalyzer electropherogram profile of a pool of SCL-exo libraries. 1ul of SCLexo library was run on an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip following the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA library length should range between 200 and 400 bp. It is important to notice the absence of adapter dimer peak (around 120 bp) and the absence of PCR primers (around 50 bp). If these contaminants are present, we recommend redoing an Ampure purification (1 volume of Ampure beads for 1 volume of DNA library) as in Step A30.B.  Bioinformatic identification of hydroxymethylated CpGs from SCL-exo fastq filesWe conceived and implemented a bioinformatic protocol to identify hydroxymethylated CpGs from SCL-exo fastq files generated in triplicates by a sequencing platform. The protocol involves the following steps:1) Trimming and filtering the sequence reads with respect to their quality using program SolexaQA (Cox et al., 2010).2) Mapping high quality reads onto each strand of the genome separately, using the program Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), in order to generate sam files for both the forward and reverse strands. Sam files are text files that contain the sequence reads together with their associated genomic localization, if any, and can be parsed to identify reads mapping a unique location on the genome. 3) Creating a hydroxymethylated CpG signal (wig) file for each replicate by directly reading the sequences in the sam files, using our python program generate-SCL-exo signal-from-sams. The program counts the number of reads uniquely overlapping any given CpG, and stores the values into a signal (wig) file at CpG or base-pair resolution. The wig file can be visualized using a genome browser, such as IGB (Nicol et al., 2009).Note: All our python programs are available at: https://mycore.corecloud.net/index.php/s/4gyZ9dLTqgo86dt.4) Identifying putative hydroxymethylated cytosines by retrieving the consensus CpG dinucleotides that are present in at least two of the three replicates, using python program generate-SCL-exo consensus-signal.5) Determining the set of CpG dinucleotides significantly enriched in 5hmC using a peak-calling algorithm (generate-SCL-exo peaks) with a well-chosen threshold.Details for each of these steps are given below:Trimming and filtering the sequenced readsOnly high-quality reads should be retained for sound identification of hydroxymethylated CpGs. Hence we used program SolexaQA (Cox et al., 2010) to trim and filter the reads present in the SCL-exo fastq files. The program takes two parameters: a quality threshold and a minimum length. First, all sequenced nucleotides whose quality is lower than the quality threshold are removed from the reads. Second, reads shorter than the minimum length are deleted. We used value 20 as the minimum nucleotide sequencing quality, corresponding to a p-value of 10^-2 (or 1% chance of occurrence of a sequencing error on any given nucleotide) and 17 as the minimum read length. The trimming is achieved by going into the SolexaQA directory and typing under Linux:perl DynamicTrim.pl fastq -h quality -d.where fastq is the path and filename of the fastq file and quality is the quality value (e.g., 20). This will generate a trimmed fastq file fastq.trimmed. The filtering is then achieved by typing:perl LengthSort.pl fastq.trimmed -l minlength where minlength is the minimum length (e.g., 17) of retained reads.2.  Mapping filtered reads onto both strands of the genome Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) can be used to map the retained high-quality reads onto the forward and reverse strands of the genome separately, with the following parameters:-p processors -l length -n nb_mismatches -m 1 --sam --strata --best --norc or --nofw# where,processors: designate the number of computer processors available for the mapping process;length: the read length taken into account to map the read onto the genome;nb_mismatches: the allowed number of mismatches;-m 1 indicates that we only retain reads mapping the genome at a unique location;--norc (respectively --nofw) that the genome reverse strand (resp. forward strand) is not used for mapping.Note that Bowtie initially requires indexing the genome fasta files (see Bowtie user guide).The reads must be mapped onto the forward and reverse strands separately, producing one sam file for each strand. Mapping was launched with Bowtie using the Linux command:./bowtie -p processors --best -l 28 -n 2 -m 1 --sam --strata --norc genome fastq > fw-sam to map reads from file fastq onto the forward strand of the indexed genome file (typically a .hs file), so as to generate a forward strand fw-sam file, and:./bowtie -p processors --best -l 28 -n 2 -m 1 --sam --strata --nofw genome fastq > rv-sam to map reads from file fastq onto the reverse strand of the indexed genome file, so as to generate a reverse strand rv-sam file.3.  Parsing single stranded sam files to generate a wig file at CpG or base-pair resolution a.  DNA  fragments  were  initially  captured  according  to  the  presence  of  5- hydroxymethylcytosine and then trimmed by exonuclease. As cytosines are mostly hydroxymethylated in a CpG context, 5hmC-positive reads should be enriched in CpGs within a few nucleotides from the start of every sequence (Sérandour et al., 2016). The sam files contain the sequence reads together with their associated genomic localization, if any.Our python program (generate-SCL-exo signal-from-sams) parses both the forward and reverse stranded sam files and considers in turn all reads uniquely mapped on the genome. It checks whether every localized read exhibits a CpG within the first few nucleotides of its sequence. Typically, a 10 base-pair long window, situated at the beginning of the read, is used to attest for the presence of a CpG. Reads not exhibiting any C p G inside the window are discarded. Reads exhibiting two or more CpGs inside the window are kept aside (their CpGs will be stored in a different file), as it is then not possible to determine with certainty which CpG was hydroxymethylated.b.  When a single CpG is found within the window, its precise genomic coordinate is determined (from the read localization provided by the sam file and the C p G position within the read) and stored in memory, within a hash table-type structure. The first time a C p G position is encountered, a value of 1 is associated to the genomic position. If a CpG position already contains a value, that value is increased by one, storing effectively the number of reads covering that particular position. Note that the program accounts for the strand associated to the sam file: in the reverse stranded sam file, the read sequences must be read from right to left, while the CpG coordinate must be adjusted (this is automatically accounted for by the program). Once all reads have been parsed, the hash table is stored within a wig file at CpG resolution by default: the genomic positions of every CpG are associated with their number of overlapping reads. By default, our program adds up the number of reads overlapping a given CpG found on both strands. It is possible to use the program so that it produces a different signal value for each stranded cytosine of the CpG, associating each cytosine position with the number of reads overlapping each strand, thus producing a wig file at base-pair resolution.c.  Our program is launched using the following Linux command:python generate-SCL-exo.py signal-from-sams fw-sam rv-sam window SCL-exo-wig resolution# where,fw-sam and rv-sam respectively designate the filenames of the forward and reverse stranded sam files;window stands for the length (typically 10), expressed in base-pairs, of the window used to identify hydroxymethylated CpG dinucleotides;resolution is an optional parameter that takes on value 2 or 1, depending on whether the SCL-exo-wig file will be generated respectively at CpG or base-pair resolution (default is 2 if the parameter is not specified).4.  Identifying the consensus CpGs found in at least two out of the three replicatesWe provide a python program generate-SCL-exo consensus-signal that compares three SCLexo signal files and returns a wig file containing the hydroxymethylated CpGs identified in at least two of the three replicates, together with their mean signal. Identified CpG positions must exhibit values greater than a minimum threshold min-threshold in at least two of the three files. An example of such consensus signal can be found in Figure 3.The function can be called thus:python generate-SCL-exo.py consensus-signal SCL-exo-wig1 SCL-exo-wig2 SCL-exo-wig3 min-threshold()Figure 3. Integrated Genome Browser view of SCL-exo signal in a region of mm8 chr11 from P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. For comparison, the Input-seq (genomic DNA of P19 cells) and SCL-seq (no exonuclease step) are shown.5.  Determining significantly enriched hydroxymethylated CpGs within SCL-exo wig filesA peak-calling algorithm is used to determine the CpGs that are significantly enriched in 5hmC within an SCL-exo signal file. The algorithm looks for adjacent genomic positions, within the SCL-exo wig file, that exhibit signal values for both CpG coordinates above a predefined threshold (Sérandour et al., 2016).The program can be used either on the consensus SCL-exo signal file or on the SCL-exo wig replicates separately.The python program generate-SCL-exo peaks takes an SCL-exo-wig file together with the predefined threshold, and generates a bed file gathering all C p G positions that satisfy the above constraints.Peak-calling on an SCL-exo-wig file at CpG or base-pair resolution is launched using the Linux command:python generate-SCL-exo.py peaks SCL-exo-wig threshold.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Samples for Illumina Sequencing\nPurify RNA-free gDNA of interest using the QIAGEN DNeasy kit and add an RNaseA digestion step.\nSonicate 1 μg of gDNA in 10 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 8, to obtain DNA fragments of around 300 bp.\nCheck sonication efficiency by running a 100-bp DNA marker and 0.5 μl of sonicated gDNA in an E-gel EX Agarose Gel (2%) for 10 min.\n## Chemical Modification of gDNA\nMix the sonicated DNA with 10× NEB Beta-GT reaction buffer, UDP-6-N3-Glc, NEB Beta-GT enzyme, and water.\nIncubate the mixture in a thermocycler at 37°C for a specified time.\nPrepare a 3 mM working solution of DBCO-PEG4-Biotin conjugate in DMSO and add it to the DNA sample.\nIncubate the mixture in a thermocycler at 37°C for a specified time and then clean up the reaction with QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit.\n## Immobilization of Modified DNA on Streptavidin-Coated Magnetic Beads\nWash Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin three times with 1× Binding & Washing (B&W) buffer.\nAdd the biotinylated DNA sample to the resuspended beads and incubate for 30 min at room temperature on rotation.\nWash the beads five times with 1 ml of 1× B&W buffer and then twice with 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.\n## End Repair, Adapter Ligation, and Nick Repair\nPerform end repair by incubating the beads with a mix containing NEB2 buffer, ATP, dNTP, T4 DNA polymerase, DNA Polymerase I Large Klenow Fragment, and T4 PolyNucleotide Kinase.\nLigate the Illumina P7 adapter to the repaired DNA by incubating the beads with a mix containing NEB2 Buffer, ATP, SCL-exo P7 adapter, and T4 DNA ligase.\nPerform nick repair by incubating the beads with a mix containing Phi29 polymerase, Home-made Nick Repair low DTT buffer, and dNTP.\n## Exonuclease Digestion\nDigest one strand of the double-stranded DNA using lambda exonuclease.\nDigest single-stranded DNA using RecJf exonuclease.\n## Elution and DNA Precipitation\nElute the DNA from the beads using elution buffer.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding glycogen, NaCl, and ethanol, and then centrifuging and washing the pellet.\n## DNA Denaturation and Second Strand Synthesis\nDenature the DNA by incubating it at 95°C for 5 min.\nPerform second strand synthesis by incubating the denatured DNA with a mix containing nuclease-free water, SCL-exo P7 primer, NEB Phi29 Reaction Buffer, Phi29 polymerase, and dNTP.\n## Ligation of SCL-exo P5 Adapter and PCR Amplification\nLigate the SCL-exo P5 adapter to the synthesized DNA by incubating it with a mix containing nuclease-free water, SCL-exo P5 adapter, NEB T4 DNA ligase Buffer, and T4 DNA ligase.\nAmplify the ligated DNA using PCR by incubating it with a mix containing nuclease-free water, NEBNext High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix, SCL-exo universal P5 PCR primer, and SCL-exo index P7 PCR primer.\n## Bioinformatic Identification of Hydroxymethylated CpGs\nTrim and filter the sequenced reads using SolexaQA.\nMap the filtered reads onto both strands of the genome using Bowtie.\nParse the single-stranded sam files to generate a wig file at CpG or base-pair resolution using the python program generate-SCL-exo signal-from-sams.\nIdentify the consensus CpGs found in at least two out of the three replicates using the python program generate-SCL-exo consensus-signal.\nDetermine significantly enriched hydroxymethylated CpGs within SCL-exo wig files using the python program generate-SCL-exo peaks.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Genomics Technologies"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2449","title":"Micro-computed Tomography to Visualize Vascular Networks in Maize Stems","text":"Micro-computed Tomography to Visualize Vascular Networks in Maize Stems\n\n# Abstract\n\nPlant vascular systems in the stem connect roots with aerial organs to move solutes containing minerals, nutrients as well as signaling molecules, and therefore, they play pivotal roles in plant growth and development. However, stem vascular systems, especially in crop species, have been poorly described since they are deeply embedded in the tissue. Here we describe a protocol to utilize micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning to visualize vascular networks in the maize stem. The protocol covers sample fixation and staining with contrasting reagents, data acquisition using micro-CT, reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) models of stem inner structures and extraction of vascular networks from the model. This protocol can be easily applied to various types of species and organs/tissues.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 50ml Polypropylene tube (Greiner Bio One International, catalog number: 227261)\n2.

Grow maize plants for 6-8 weeks. Our growth condition is at 26~^°C under 14-h-light and 10- h-dark condition in the green house. At 6 weeks, the floral transition of the shoot apical meristem has already occurred and the tassel primordium is developing. b.  Dissect maize shoot into 10 cm long sections (Figure 2). Make sure to include the shoot apex in this region. As internodes become shorter toward the apex, we can assume the approximate position of the shoot apex.()Figure 2. A maize stem sample fixed in FAAc.  Put the sample into a 50mI conical tube and fill the tube with FAA solution (see Recipes).d.  Slowly vacuum the sample until small air bubbles begin to come out from the samples, then seal the chamber. After 15m i n , slowly release the vacuum pressure.e.  After releasing the vacuum, replace the solution with new FAA. Vacuum the sample for 15 min again.f.  Replace the solution with new FAA and store the sample at 4^°C for at least 1 week.g.  Replace FAA with 70% EtOH and rotate the sample tube at 4^°C for 3 h. Replace 70% EtOH with new 70% EtOH. Store the sample in 70% EtOH at 4^°C until observation. Note: FAA and 70% EtOH containing formaldehyde must be disposed of according to regulations of your institute/university and local governments.2.  Sample staining with contrasting reagentsa.  Replace 70% EtOH with 35% EtOH and incubate for ^2h at room temperature.b.  Discard 35% EtOH and incubate the samples in distilled water at room temperature for 1.5 h. Repeat this step two more times with fresh distilled water.c.  Replace the water with 25% Lugol solution (see Recipes) and vacuum for 15 min. Stain the sample for 6 days at room temperature in the dark. Note: Staining duration depends on the type of tissues and their size. Check the staining before detailed observation (please see Step C2). For maize stems, it takes 6 days (Figure 3).()Figure 3. Time-course observation of a maize stem stained with Lugol solution. A maize stem stained in 25% Lugol solution for 1 day (A), 2 days (B), 4 days (C) and 6 days (D) was scanned using micro-CT. These images were processed and displayed in OsiriX. Scale bar =5 mm.B.  Mounting samples1.  Place wet Kimwipes and filter foams at the bottom of 50ml conical tube. 2.  Put the stained maize stem in the center of the tube. Make sure to insert the sample so that the lower side of the sample comes to the bottom of the tube (Figure 4A).# Notes:a.  Softwares used in the downstream data analysis (OsiriX and Imaris) display the imported data upside down. To avoid cumbersome data processing to correct this, we simply mount the samples upside down.b.  As Lugol staining is rapidly released from tissue into water, just remove excess solution with paper towels. Do not rinse the sample with water.c.  Samples will be rotated on the stage in micro-CT equipment during the data acquisition. It is important to place samples in the center of the stage to obtain high resolution images.3.  Place filter foams and wet Kimwipes on the other end of the sample and close the tube. Note: Maize stems become softer after Lugol staining. Handle the sample gently to avoid deformation. At the same time, make sure to place enough wet Kimwipes and filter foams so that the sample doesn’t move in the tube. The movement of samples during data acquisition will result in a blurred image. Also, moisture in the tube is important to avoid sample drying and deformation.()Figure 4. Mounting a maize stem for micro-CT scanning. A. The stained maize stem was mounted in a 50 ml polypropylene tube using wet Kimwipes and filter foams. B. The tube was attached on the stage in micro-CT scanner with a piece of clay.# C.  Data acquisition1.  Put a piece of clay on the sample stage in the micro-CT equipment and fix the sample tube tightly on the clay (Figure 4B).2.  Set the voltage at 90~kV and the current at 85uA . Close the door of the equipment and turn on the X-ray. Now you can see the sample displayed in the fluoroscopic image monitor. To make the stem inner structure visible in the monitor, narrow down the luminance window of the fluoroscopic image. If the sample is stained enough, you can see the conical shape of the shoot apex in the monitor at this point (Figure 5). Determine the position of the shoot apex.3.  Check the sample by rotating the stage. Adjust the tube angle so that the sample stands upside down in the center at a right angle to the stage (Figure 5A).()Figure 5. X-ray fluoroscopic imaging before scanning. A. The stem sample mounted on the stage. Note that the stem sample is upside down. A yellow box represents region magnified in (B). B. A magnification of the boxed region in (A). Dashed lines and circle depict a young stem and tassel primordium, respectively. The image was rotated 180^° from (A).4.  Return the luminance window to its full range. Note: We adjusted the luminance window just to make the sample visible on the monitor. In data acquisition, the luminance window should be the full range.5.  Determine the scanning area and set scanning parameters (e.g., Table S1) depending on the purpose of your experiment. It is a trade-off between data acquisition area and resolution as shown in (Figure 6).()Figure 6. Maize stem images scanned using micro-CT at various resolution. A. A vertical section of the stem. Dashed boxes (c) (d) and (e) represent the magnified regions in (C), (D) and (E), respectively. B-E. Transverse sections of the stem. The resolutions are 67.7, 30.0, 17.0 and 10.0~um/pixel in (A and B), (C), (D) and (E), respectively. The detailed settings in the scanning are provided in Table S1.# 6.  Scan the samples.Note: When the sample size is larger than the area of data acquisition, the surrounding tissue outside of the field of view causes various noise (Figure 6E). If higher resolution is necessary, trimming the sample to remove surrounding tissue/organs will reduce noise in the data (see below).7.  If necessary, remove leaves and stems to expose the part of your interest. To mount smaller samples, we use micro-tubes of appropriate size. Put wet Kimwipes and filter foams to fix the sample inside of the tube (Figure 7).()Figure 7. Mounting trimmed maize stems in 1.5m1 tubes. A. Tenth and eleventh leaves from the tassel were removed from the stem sample shown in Figure 2. B. Ninth and eighth leaves were further removed. C. Diagrams showing the trimmed maize stem mounted in 1.5ml tubes. Red arrows indicate supporting points of samples.8.  Scan the samples with the setting for higher resolution (Table S2). Figure 8 shows that trimming the samples greatly reduces the noise and enables to increase the resolution. Note: The resolution of micro-CT images could be further improved by increasing frame average and number of projections (and hence, scanning time as well) (Table S2 and Figure 9).()Figure 8.

Green lines (a), (b), (d) and (e) represent the plane of transverse sections shown in (A), (B), (D) and (E), respectively. The detailed settings of frame average and number of projections are shown in Table S2. Scale bars =1~m m .9.  The raw data will be saved as .raw files. Import the raw data into a built-in reconstruction software in the micro-CT system (e.g., coneCTexpress). Trim blank spaces, determine axes for coronal/sagittal sections, reduce noises using the noise reduction filter and convert the raw data into 8-bit Tiff images. Save the reconstructed Tiff image dataset. Note: To compare multiple samples, a uniform setting in this step will be important.10. Before importing the Tiff files into an image analysis software OsiriX, we rename them as following: Date_sample_resolution (µm)_number.tiff. This is important so that the image files are read by OsiriX in the correct order.D.  Constructing scanning movie from micro-CT dataHere, we introduce how to make a scanning movie using the software OsiriX to explore the microCT data (Video 1).()Video 1. A 2D movie showing transverse sections of a maize stem. Green bars represent the plane shown in the transverse window. Structural annotations were added using Adobe Premiere Pro CC.1.  To import Tiff image data, disable ‘Import DICOM file format only’ option in the preferences of OsiriX.

(‘Import’ icon arrow Select the data folder. ongrightarrow ‘Copy Links’)3.  To display the imported data, select the data file shown in ‘Documents DB window’ and click ‘2D Viewer’ icon. Then, select ‘3D Volume Rendering’ from the ‘3D Viewer’ in the top menu and enter resolution information in the fields of pixel X, Y and slice interval (Figure 10A).# Notes:a.  If OsiriX gives an error message, click ‘Continue’.b.  The unit of the resolution is mm/pixel. Convert the resolution in µm/pixel into mm/pixel (e.g., 30mu m/pi x e lto0.030m m/pi x e l) .4.  After clicking ^O K^ , a new window will open. Close this window.5.  At this point, ‘Orientation’ icon has become active (Figure 10B). Now we can set the direction of 2D sections shown in the display using this icon and explore the sections using the slider located on the upper side of the 2D window.6.  Open additional two windows by clicking ‘Window’ icon and selecting ^3 window’ (Figure 10C). Enter the resolution information for these two windows as described in the Steps D3 and D4. Display coronal, sagittal and transverse sections in each window using ‘Orientation’ icon (Figures 10B and 9D).7.  Select settings for window appearance using ‘WL/WW & CLUT’ and ‘Thick Slab’ functions. Our setting is below: WL/WW & CLUT (Figure 10E (a)) WL/WW (window level/window width): Other CLUT (color look up table): B/W Inverse Opacity: Linear Table Thick Slab (Figure 10E (b)) Mode: MIP8.  Adjust image WL/WW, position, magnification and angle in the window using tools shown in Figure 10E (c), (d), (e) and (f), respectively.9.  To adjust size and arrangement of each window for the movie preparation, disable ‘Magnetic Windows for move & resize’. (Top Menu ‘OsiriX MD’ ongrightarrow ‘Preferences’ ongrightarrow ‘Viewers’ icon arrow uncheck ‘Magnetic Windows for move & resize’.) Adjust size and arrangement of windows (e.g., Figure 10F).

Creating 3D model of maize stem vascular networksHere, we extract vein traces and reconstruct vascular networks in maize stems using Imaris, a software which can be used in various analysis of 3D data including the extraction of filamentous structure such as veins. As this procedure includes many steps of manual operation, we provide videos to explain how to determine vein traces in 3D data (Videos 2 and 3).1.

A movie introducing procedures to prepare the maize stem 3D model in Imaris# 2.  Tracing veins to create 3D model of vascular networksVein traces are the combination of relatively straight lines in internodes and winding lines in nodes. To make a vein trace from the micro-CT data, we divide a vein into a few segments depending on the position (internode or node), extract them independently and join them into a single trace.a.  Change settings of FilamentTracer to extract veins manually (Top menu ‘3D view’ icon arrow ‘Filament’ icon (Figure 12A) arrow Click ‘Skip automatic creation, edit manually’ (Figure 12B) arrow ‘Draw’ tab arrow Check ‘Manual’, ‘Automatic Placement’ and ‘XZ Plane’ (magenta boxes in Figure 12C).

As default, the volume object shown as ‘Volume’ in the object list area is selected. To display slices of the XZ plane, uncheck ‘Volume’, otherwise the slices hide behind the volume object. Determine a vein to be traced using the slider (the bottom magenta box in Figure 12C and Video 3: 15~24 sec).c.  Before starting to trace a vein, check ‘Select’ in ‘Camera/Labels’ window and then adjust the line width to that of the vein by wheeling the computer mouse. The size of square around the mouse pointer represents the line width. (The magenta box in Figure 12D and Video 3: 26~31 sec). Note: This step is important for Imaris to recognize a vein efficiently based on the brightness of the 3D data.d.  Manually trace a segment of the vein in an internode.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2450","title":"Electron Tomography to Study the Three-dimensional Structure of Plasmodesmata in Plant Tissues–from High Pressure Freezing Preparation to Ultrathin Section Collection","text":"Electron Tomography to Study the Three-dimensional Structure of Plasmodesmata in Plant Tissues–from High Pressure Freezing Preparation to Ultrathin Section Collection\n\n# Abstract\n\nPlasmodesmata (PD) are nanometric ( 20~n m wide) membrane lined pores encased in the cell walls of the adjacent plant cells. They allow the cells to exchange all types of molecules ranging from nutrients like sugar, hormones, to RNAs and various proteins. Unfortunately, they are also hijacked by phyto-viruses, enabling them to spread from cell-to-cell and then systematically throughout the whole plant. Their central position in plant biology makes it crucial to understand their physiology and especially link their function to their structure. Over the past 50 years, electron microscopists have observed them and attempted to ultrastructurally characterize them. They laid the foundation of what is known about these pores (Tilney et al., 1991; Ding et al., 1992; Oparka and Roberts, 2001; Nicolas et al., 2017a).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# A.

IMOD suite (http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/)\nNote:  All  processing  was  done  using  the  IMOD  suite  (Kremer  et  al.,  1996)\n(http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/),  from  the  alignment  of  the  raw  tilt  series  to  tomogram\nreconstruction, segmentation and data analysis.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nNote: This procedure involves the manipulation of dangerous compounds, namely liquid nitrogen, acetone, osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, uranyl-acetate, Lowicryl resin. If you are not familiar with how to handle such compounds, please refer to the official guidelines and our Notes 1 and 2.A.  High pressure freezingSteps A1 through A13 should be carried out as fast as possible to limit deterioration of sampled live tissue. In our case, this period is less than a minute. A thorough description on how to use the EMPACT1 is provided in user manual and also in the proof of concept paper (Studer et al., 2001).1.  Turn on Leica EMPACT and air compressor hooked up to it.2.  Fill up the chamber with MCH and evacuate air in the circuit by gently pushing on the vertical rod.3.  Fill in liquid nitrogen tank up to % (keep liquid nitrogen source handy for eventual mid-way top-ups during session).4.  Switch on the EMPACT1 and wait until working pressure reaches between 4.8 and 5 bars.5.  On the touchscreen tap on the corresponding valve to allow filling of the bath with liquid nitrogen (Figure 2B).6.  Load an empty pod and tap on p r e p a r earrow l o c karrow s t a n to shoot in order to clear out all the air out of the system.7.  Charge membrane carrier on the Leica loading system (Figure 2A, #2 and Video 1).()Video 1. Loading the biological sample in the HPF pods. (1) 200~um deep membrane carriers (Leica Microsystems); (2) Vertically grown Arabidopsis seedlings; (3) Becker filled liquid MS medium; (4) 20% BSA diluted in liquid MS medium; (5) 0.5-2~ul and 20-200~ul range pipets (Sartorius); (6) Torque screwdriver set to 30Ncm (TOHNICHI, Torque driver RTD60CN); (7) Disposable razor blades; (8) Style 7 EMS tweezers; (9) Disposable tooth picks; (10) Leica loading system (with rod), pods, pod holder.8.  If using the 200~um membrane carriers with a hole on the bottom, wedge an aclar disk generated with the puncher. Disks can be generated in batches the day before cryofixation, incubated in 95% ethanol and let to evaporate.9.  With a 0.5-2~ul pipet, fill the carrier with 20% BSA (Recipe 2) in MS (Murashige and Skoog medium). It must form a clean dome in the socket without bleeding on the edges and with no air bubbles (Video 1).10. Handling of biological material: i) Roots are quickly dissected under binocular in MS medium on a glass slide with a sharp razor blade and then carefully picked up with a toothpick. ii) Cells are aliquoted in a 1.5m Eppendorf tube from the main 200 ml flask and are let to sediment down for a few minutes. Then, the cells are picked up by scratching from the green cell pellet visible at the bottom with a toothpick or a little metal spoon shaped scooper, Cells are then carefully placed in a membrane carrier. Every 2 to 3 HPF trials ( moon min time frame when two experimenters are implicated), replace the cells in the Eppendorf tube by fresh cells.11. Dispose the sample in the BSA bubble in the membrane carrier. It is best when the sample is completely submerged by the BSA (Video 1).12. Push the membrane carrier in the pod positioned in its special socket on the Leica loading system (Video 1).13. Screw the sapphire tight on the carrier using the TORX screwdriver (set on 2.5c Nm^-1 ) (Video 1).14. Screw the white pod holder (Video 1).15. Load it in the Leica EMPACT machine and the loading stage and push the piston towards the left (Video 2).()Video 2. Loading the pod containing the sample in the HPF machine16. On the touch screen tap on p r e p a r earrow l o c karrow s t a r t . The system automatically flushes out the pod holder, making the pod loaded with the sample fall in a liquid N_2 bath. At this stage the sample must never come out of the liquid N_2 , risking sudden devitrification and the waste of the sample (Video 2).17. Check the freezing rate and pressure rise on the touchscreen. It should look like in Figure 2C, where maximum pressure is reached 20 msec before reaching final temperature.18. Place pod holder in the specially designed socket bathing in the liquid nitrogen (Video 2).19. Unscrew the pod holder (Video 2).20. Carefully release the clamping from the sapphire by unscrewing and then gently tug out the membrane carrier by tapping the pod against the bottom of the bath. Use insulated tweezers to manipulate the frozen membrane carrier (Video 2).21. Place the membrane carrier in the sample carrier dedicated to this usage and keep in liquid N_2 (Video 2).22. When all samples are ready to be transferred for subsequent steps, place metal lids on the metal containers and quickly transfer the containers from the EMPACT bath to an intermediate liquid nitrogen container. Then transfer to AFS2 machine, already running, filled up with liquid N_2 and pre-cooled to -90~^°C .B.  Freeze substitutionDuring the freeze substitution, it is important to always maintain the frozen hydrated samples in the cold, below -80~^°C to avoid too much hexagonal ice formation (Dubochet, 2007). Therefore, never pick up the tubes out of the well and always use instruments, containers and FS solutions that have been precooled in the well for a good 15-20 min.Because Steps B7 to B9 are tedious, we would recommend at the beginning to devote a full day to it.1.  Under a vented hood, dispatch cryomix (see Recipe 4) immediately after having added osmium into the screw top tubes (numbered with a Sharpie and wrapped in scotch tape to avoid washing out of the ink) and then dip the tubes in liquid nitrogen to freeze the cryomix (less volatile when frozen).2.  Insert frozen cryomix containing tubes in the AFS well, inside the metal cups.3.  While cryomix is still solid, carefully dispatch the frozen sample containing membrane carriers inside the cryomix tubes (maximum of 2 carriers/tube).4.  During the thawing process of the cryomix from the -195^°C to -90~^°C transition, the carriers will sink in the mix and freeze-substitution will start.5.  Set the AFS as following:()6.  (OPTIONAL but highly encouraged) At day +1 after the start of the FS, open the cryomix tubes and redispose the carriers at the bottom in such a way that the carriers do not lay on top of each other in order to maximise the exchanges between the mix and the samples. Also, a gentle shake can be given to the tubes.7.  After completion of the -90~^°C to -50~^°C transition, the machine is on hold at -50~^°C .8.  Wash thoroughly every tube 3 times with ultra-pure acetone and then 3 times with ultrapure ethanol (Note 3).9.  During the last wash, transfer the samples into a plastic mould container containing 100% ethanol.10. Carefully separate the samples from the membrane carriers in a plastic mould container using the microtools (Figure 3, #5 and #6). Use them to scrape the rim of the carriers to loosen the frozen BSA. If using 200~um deep carriers (Leica Microsystems), the hole at the bottom can be used to push out the frozen sample by fitting the ultra-micro needle tool (Figure 3, #5, right one).11. Prior to the Transfer of the detached sample in the moulds with a 3ml pipette, fill the moulds with cold ultrapure ethanol and let them cool down to -50~^°C (Note 4).Note: During Steps B3 to B8, cryotubes should always be closed in between the baths in order to avoid sublimation of residual osmium tetroxide.C. Resin embedding1.  When all samples are in place in the adequate moulds, gently pipet out the excess ethanol from the moulds (see Note 3 for pipetting technique) and replace with 25% HM20 (see Recipe 5).2.  The following incubation kinetic is just a guideline. Adapt according to your work days:()3.  On the last 100% HM20 bath, place the mould containers in the metal piece (Figure 3, #3) that has been cooled down to -50~^°C before hand.4.  Mount the FSP module and set the AFS as following:()5.  Take out hardened resin blocks from their casts by either slicing the casts carefully with razor blades or, if using the pill-shape moulds, the blocks can be punched out using a hexagonal screwdriver placed on the bottom (Video 3).()Video 3. Puncturing out the pill-shaped blocks. It requires a Wiha 353/SW 3.0x75 screwdriver for puncturing.D.  Ultramicrotomy1.  Grid filmingBecause we embed our samples in HM20 Lowicryl, a more fragile resin than EPON, the sections need to be deposited on grids that have been coated with parlodion or formvar. Formvar-coated slot grids were purchased and useful because no grid bars can potentially block the imaging in high tilts. However, they are more fragile and very sensitive to shifts induced by resin retraction. For parlodion-filmed mesh grids, they are home-made as follows (Video 4):a.  Fill a crystalizing dish, placed in a large Petri dish, with distilled water to the top.b.  Rack the top of the crystalizing dish with a glass wand to flatten out the surface of the water.c. Pipet the parlodion solution with a Pasteur pipet and place the pipet vertically over the crystalizing dish. Let a drop fall on the surface of the water.d.  Let the parlodion spread at the surface of the water.e.  With clamps, remove this first film (used to eliminate potential dust and particles on the water surface).f.  Repeat Steps D1b and D1c.g.  Carefully place the grids on the floating parlodion film (opaque side face down on the film). Use the mesh desired (200 m e s h/mu m^2 is optimal for better overviews and tilt series acquisition).h.  With tweezers, gently place a Whatman type 41 absorbent paper (or equivalent absorption speed) on the floating grids and let it soak.i. Carefully remove excess parlodion film on the sides of the absorbent paper, either by tearing it away or folding it on top of the floating paper. This is to prevent excess film to fold onto the grids, resulting in a double layer of film on the filmed grids.j.  To avoid rippling and/or sliding of the film, firmly grip the absorbent paper by the sides with 2 tweezers type 5X or like (which close automatically) and transfer the absorbent paper by flipping it over into a glass/plastic Petri dish.k.  Let the Petri dish open for a day under ventilated hood, in order to let the filmed grids dry out.Quality check: Under the binocular of the ultramicrotome, pick up a filmed grid and by reflection look for a homogenous purple glare on the grid. Under the TEM, the grids may display a few little holes, which is fine. However, when a lot of holes occur, the parlodion solution may be contaminated with water and may need to be replaced.()Video 4.

Section collectiona.  Since the aim of this protocol is more focused on how to process the samples as this is the critical factor for the final images, we will not go into details on how to properly use an ultramicrotome, prepare the block-face for cutting etc. Instead please refer to Hagler (2007). The following is some comments for properly performing these steps.b.  For the study of PD, 90n m or 180n m thick sections were collected with the Leica Ultracut UC7 (Leica Microsystems).c.  Producing serial sections can be useful for two main reasons: i) with one grid, more objects of  interest,  ii)  serial  tomography  can  be  performed  where  the  same  structure  is reconstructed on serial sections, making it possible to recover 3D volumes of structures a lot bigger than the section thickness (Kang et al., 2011).d.  To do so, the block face needs to be reasonably small enough so that multiple sections can be placed on a single grid. Carving the block face in a trapeze shape will allow the sections to stick together as they are generated, creating a contiguous ribbon of serial sections that can be easily deposited on a single grid simultaneously.e.  Although it is usually not a problem when using non-carbonated parlodion-filmed copper grids, if sections are repelled by the grids due to static charge during the collection step, grids can be glow-discharged prior to section collection.f.  Depending on the EM voltage (more voltage equals more kinetic energy of the electrons, and therefore a better ability to image thick samples well) and the size of the structures of interest, thickness of the sections can vary from 90n m to 180n m . Finer sections, closer to 90 nm in thickness will yield slightly better x, y resolution, especially in medium range EM voltages as in our case. 180n m and greater will allow better volume recovery at the expense of x, y resolution when imaged at 120~kV. In the case of PD study, simple ones have a diameter range from 20 to 40 n m thick, so 90~n m thick sections are appropriate. However, it has to be noted that PD can be of various lengths and sizes, especially when it comes to branched complex PD. Therefore they can extend to several hundreds of nm across the cell wall in all directions. In this case, increasing the section thickness grants better chances to fully recover the volume of the pores.3.  Coating grids with fiducial markers (gold particles)Gold particles are used for the subsequent alignment steps required prior to tomogram reconstruction. Because pure colloidal gold tends to aggregate due to its inherent negative charge, it is often used diluted with BSA, making the spread of the gold more homogenous across the section.a.  On a sheet of paraffin film, lay drops of gold solution (see Recipe 8) and water (Figure 5).b.  Gently lay the grids on the gold drops for 20 sec approximately.c. (Optional) Gently pipet up and down the mixture to favor good contact between the grid and the gold.d.  Sequentially lay the grids for a few seconds on two water drops to remove excess gold solution.e.  Absorb the remaining liquid by approaching absorbent paper (Whatman paper Grade 5) on the side of the grid.f.  Repeat Steps D3a to D3e on the other side of the grid in order to have gold particles on both sides.g.  Let the grids dry prior to introduction in the EM (damages the ionic pump system otherwise).()Figure 5. Laying the fiducial markers on the grids. Typical setting for fiducial marker deposition on grid prior to tomography. Grids are first laid on top of the red drops (fiducial marker ^+ BSA solution) for 15-20 sec then dragged consecutively in the water drops and carefully dried by the rim of the grid with absorbent paper. This process needs to be repeated on both sides of the grids.\n\n# Outline\n\n## High Pressure Freezing\n## Preparation\nTurn on Leica EMPACT and air compressor hooked up to it.\nFill up the chamber with MCH and evacuate air in the circuit by gently pushing on the vertical rod.\nFill in liquid nitrogen tank up to the required level (keep liquid nitrogen source handy for eventual mid-way top-ups during session).\n## Loading the Sample\nSwitch on the EMPACT1 and wait until working pressure reaches between 4.8 and 5 bars.\nOn the touchscreen tap on the corresponding valve to allow filling of the bath with liquid nitrogen.\nLoad an empty pod and tap on prepare arrow lock arrow start to shoot in order to clear out all the air out of the system.\n## Sample Preparation\nCharge membrane carrier on the Leica loading system.\nIf using the 200~um membrane carriers with a hole on the bottom, wedge an aclar disk generated with the puncher.\nWith a 0.5-2~ul pipet, fill the carrier with 20% BSA in MS.\n## Handling of Biological Material\nRoots are quickly dissected under binocular in MS medium on a glass slide with a sharp razor blade and then carefully picked up with a toothpick.\nCells are aliquoted in a 1.5m Eppendorf tube from the main 200 ml flask and are let to sediment down for a few minutes.\nCells are then carefully placed in a membrane carrier.\n## Freezing\nDispose the sample in the BSA bubble in the membrane carrier.\nPush the membrane carrier in the pod positioned in its special socket on the Leica loading system.\nScrew the sapphire tight on the carrier using the TORX screwdriver.\n## Loading the Pod\nLoad it in the Leica EMPACT machine and the loading stage and push the piston towards the left.\nOn the touch screen tap on prepare arrow lock arrow start.\nCheck the freezing rate and pressure rise on the touchscreen.\n## Freeze Substitution\n## Preparation of Cryomix\nUnder a vented hood, dispatch cryomix immediately after having added osmium into the screw top tubes.\nInsert frozen cryomix containing tubes in the AFS well, inside the metal cups.\n## Freeze Substitution Process\nWhile cryomix is still solid, carefully dispatch the frozen sample containing membrane carriers inside the cryomix tubes.\nSet the AFS as following.\nAfter completion of the -90~^°C to -50~^°C transition, the machine is on hold at -50~^°C.\n## Washing and Transfer\nWash thoroughly every tube 3 times with ultra-pure acetone and then 3 times with ultrapure ethanol.\nDuring the last wash, transfer the samples into a plastic mould container containing 100% ethanol.\nCarefully separate the samples from the membrane carriers in a plastic mould container using the microtools.\n## Resin Embedding\n## Preparation of Samples\nWhen all samples are in place in the adequate moulds, gently pipet out the excess ethanol from the moulds.\nReplace with 25% HM20.\nThe following incubation kinetic is just a guideline.\n## Embedding\nOn the last 100% HM20 bath, place the mould containers in the metal piece that has been cooled down to -50~^°C before hand.\nMount the FSP module and set the AFS as following.\nTake out hardened resin blocks from their casts by either slicing the casts carefully with razor blades.\n## Ultramicrotomy\n## Grid Filming\nFill a crystalizing dish, placed in a large Petri dish, with distilled water to the top.\nRack the top of the crystalizing dish with a glass wand to flatten out the surface of the water.\nPipet the parlodion solution with a Pasteur pipet and place the pipet vertically over the crystalizing dish.\n## Section Collection\nFor the study of PD, 90n m or 180n m thick sections were collected with the Leica Ultracut UC7.\nProducing serial sections can be useful for two main reasons.\nTo do so, the block face needs to be reasonably small enough so that multiple sections can be placed on a single grid.\n## Coating Grids with Fiducial Markers\nOn a sheet of paraffin film, lay drops of gold solution and water.\nGently lay the grids on the gold drops for 20 sec approximately.\nSequentially lay the grids for a few seconds on two water drops to remove excess gold solution.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Plant Science & Technology"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2457","title":"Targeted Genome Editing of Virulent Phages Using CRISPR-Cas9","text":"Targeted Genome Editing of Virulent Phages Using CRISPR-Cas9\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis protocol describes a straightforward method to generate specific mutations in the genome of strictly lytic phages. Briefly, a targeting CRISPR-Cas9 system and a repair template suited for homologous recombination are provided inside a bacterial host, here the Gram-positive model Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is programmed to cleave a specific region present on the genome of the invading phage, but absent from the recombination template. The system either triggers the recombination event or exerts the selective pressure required to isolate recombinant phages. With this methodology, we generated multiple gene knockouts, a point mutation and an insertion in the genome of the virulent lactococcal phage p2. Considering the broad host range of the plasmids used in this protocol, the latter can be extrapolated to other phage-host pairs.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.  Materials\n\n1.

Spacer cloning in pL2Cas9Plasmid pL2Cas9 encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 components derived from the strain Streptococcus pyogenes SF370 as well as an erythromycin resistance gene. To avoid plasmid loss in E. . coli or L . lactis, erythromycin is added to media to a final concentration of 150u/m l (Em 150) or 5ug/ml (Em 5), respectively. When purchased from Addgene, pL2Cas9 is sent as a stab culture of transformed E. coli NEB5α strain. Steps A2 to A4 are adapted from Jiang et al. (2013).1.  Purification pL2Cas9 a.  Streak the bacterial strain from the stab to a BHI Em 150 plate (see Recipes). b.  Incubate overnight at 37 ^°C . c.  Pick a single colony with a sterile pipette tip using sterile tweezers and drop the tip into 500 ml of BHI Em 150 (see Recipes). d.  Incubate overnight at 37 ^°C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.e.  Follow QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit protocol for isolating low copy plasmid. Note: We transfer the isopropanol precipitate in 16×1.5 ml micro-tubes to minimize loss of DNA during the washing step. Each DNA pellet is then redissolved in 20 µl of the provided plasmid resuspension buffer and pooled in a 1.5 ml micro-tube.f.  Run a sample of the purified plasmid DNA preparation on a 0.8% agarose gel (see Recipes) with the High DNA Mass Ladder to estimate DNA concentration. Note: To visualize DNA, we use EZ-Vision® Three, a 6x loading buffer containing a fluorescent DNA dye.g.  Keep the purified plasmid DNA at -20~^°C until needed.2.  Spacer design and annealinga.  Search for a 5’-NGG-3’ sequence in the locus to modify (Figure 1). This signature sequence constitutes the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognized by SpCas9.b.  To clone the desired spacer in pL2Cas9, design and synthesize two ssDNA oligos of 35 nucleotides corresponding to both strands of the selected protospacer with BsaI restriction sites (Figure 1, Table 1). Note: The GC content of the spacer sequences should not influence the efficiency of S p C a s9 to cleave its target DNA (Tao et al., 2017). To avoid off-target activity, make sure that the protospacer is not found elsewhere in the phage or the cloning host genome next to a functional PAM.c.  Dilute the oligos to 50uM in molecular biology water.d.  For 5' -phosphorylation of the oligos, mix 2ul of each diluted oligo with 10ul of 5× T4 ligase buffer, 1~ul of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and 32ul of distilled water in a PCR tube to a final volume of 50~ul . Note: 5x T4 ligase buffer is supplied with T4 DNA ligase. Divide the ligase buffer into singleuse aliquots as ATP in the buffer can be degraded by repeated freeze-thaw cycles.e.  Perform the phosphorylation for 30m i n at 37~^°C and heat inactivate the PNK for 20 min at 65^°C (in a PCR machine or a water bath).f.  Add 2.5ul of 1 M NaCl to the phosphorylated oligos.g.  Place the tube in a PCR thermal cycler and heat the sample for 5 min at 95^°C before cooling down to 25^°C at a rate of 0.1~^°C per sec.h.  Keep at -20~^°C for up to 2 months.()Figure 1. Graphical representation of a spacer design. In this example, a PAM is identified in the phage genome. The 30 bp sequence upstream the PAM is called the ‘protospacer’, and must be incorporated into the CRISPR array (crRNA) in the form of a ‘spacer’ to dictate target specificity. BsaI restriction sites are added to the ends of the spacer for ligation into pL2Cas9.3.  Digestion of pL2Cas9 with BsaIa.  Digest 1 u of purified pL2Cas9 with BsaI by following the manufacturer’s instructions with an overnight incubation at 37~^°C (final volume of 50ul ).b.  Dephosphorylate the 5' -ends of the digested pL2Cas9 with the Antarctic phosphatase by following the manufacturer’s instructions.c.  Purify the digested and dephosphorylated vector by precipitation with salts and ethanol. Note: Purification by gel extraction removes uncut vector, but the yield is poor. i.  Add 1:10 volume of NaAc 3 M pH 5.2 to DNA. ii. Add 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. iii. Mix thoroughly and incubate on ice for 15m i n . iv. Centrifuge in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 16,000× g for 15min . v. Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 70% ethanol (see Recipes). vi. Air dry the pellet for 5-10 m i n .vii. Resuspend the pellet in 30ul0m M Tris-HCl pH 8.5.d.  Run the purified vector on a 0.8% agarose gel with the annealed oligos as well as both the High DNA Mass and 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladders in separate wells to estimate concentrations.e.  Store the digested pL2Cas9 at -20~^°C until needed.Note: Aliquot into smaller volumes to prevent DNA degradation that may occur during repeated freeze-thaw cycles.4.  Ligation of the targeting plasmida.  Set up ligation reactions with the T4 DNA ligase following the manufacturer’s instructions. Use a molar ratio of approximately 3:1 of insert to vector.b.  Prepare another ligation reaction without the insert (negative ligation control) to evaluate vector re-circularization.c.  Perform the ligations overnight at 16^°C (in a PCR machine or a water bath).d.  Heat inactivate the ligase at 65~^°C for 10m i n , put on ice, and proceed immediately to the transformation (Steps A5 and A6). Note: Ligation products can be kept a few days at -20~^°C , but transformation efficiency will decrease.5.  Preparation of L. lactis MG1363 competent cellsNote: If working with other phage-host, transformation of DNA constructs can be done directly into the bacterial host of interest or first into L. lactis MG1363. In the latter case, DNA constructs have to be extracted from the cloning host and then transferred into the host of interest. Cells should be transformed with one plasmid, selected with the appropriate antibiotics, made competent, transformed with the second plasmid, and selected with both antibiotics. We do not recommend double transformation.a.  Inoculate 10ml of GM17 broth (see Recipes) with L. lactis MG1363 and incubate overnight at 30^°C .b.  Inoculate 5 tubes containing 9.7~m glycine shock solution (see Recipes) with 300ul of the overnight culture from Step A5a. Note: A 10-ml bacterial culture is sufficient to prepare 50 µl of competent cells. Typically, 5 ×5O µl competent cells are prepared for the transformation of: (1) the ligation product, (2) uncut vector (positive transformation control), (3) dephosphorylated cut vector (negative digestion control) (4) negative ligation control, and (5) no DNA (negative transformation control). If needed, additional cultures can be prepared concomitantly.c.  Incubate at 30~^°C until the bacterial cultures reach an OD600 of 0.2.d.  Transfer the cultures into sterile centrifuge bottles (SS-34) and centrifuge for 5 min at 4^°C and 12,000× g . Note: From here onwards, cultures and solutions should be kept on ice whenever possible.e.  Discard supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of sterile cold wash solution (see Recipes).f.  Transfer cells into 1.5m micro-tubes.g.  Centrifuge the resuspensions in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 16,000× g for 1 min. Note: We perform this step at room temperature (RT). , but a refrigerated microcentrifuge may be used to keep the cultures cold (4^°C) .h.  Repeat the last three steps twice.# bio-protocoli.  Resuspend each pellet of competent cells in 50~ul of sterile cold wash solution before pooling them in a 1.5ml micro-tube and proceed immediately to Step A6.6.  Electroporation of L. lactis MG1363a.  Dialyse assembled DNA using a membrane (Figure 2). Note: Ligation and Gibson Assembly products should be desalted prior to electroporation.()Figure 2. Quick and easy DNA dialysis. A. Heat the wide end of a Pasteur pipette with a Bunsen burner flame until the glass turns red. B. Quickly pierce the lid of a 1.5ml micro-tube. C. Add ^2m of distilled water in the micro-tube. Due to surface tension, a convex meniscus should be above the edge of the micro-tube. D. Place a 4-cm square of dialysis membrane (MWCO 6-8000) in distilled water. Once it is hydrated, cut the dialysis membrane tubing to the length to have two separate layers of membrane. Put a single layer of membrane onto the water and close the lid of the micro-tube. Make sure there is no air bubble between the water and the dome-shaped membrane. E. Remove excess water on top of the membrane. F. Put 5ul of DNA sample on top of the membrane. G. Wait approximately 30 sec. H. Collect the desalted DNA. Repeat the whole process for every sample to dialyse.b.  Add 5ul of DNA (or water for negative transformation control) and 45ul of competent cells to cold electroporation cuvettes. Note: Keep the cuvettes and the recovery solution on ice.c.  Set up the Gene Pulser to 25uF_: , 200 Ω and 2.5K V.d.  Place a cuvette in the track and simultaneously push both red buttons until the tone.e.  Quickly add 500~ul of cold recovery solution (see Recipes) to cells and leave on ice for 10 min. f.  Transfer the content of the cuvettes into 1.5ml micro-tubes.g.  Repeat the last three steps for every transformation.h.  Incubate for ^2h at 30~^°C .i.  Plate the cells on GM17 supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (see Recipes). Use 5-10 glass beads per plate to spread the transformed cells evenly.j.  Incubate for 24-48~h~ at 30^°C .Colony PCRa.  To confirm the presence of the DNA insert in the plasmid constructs, pick several single colonies with sterile pipette tips and place each of them in 50~ul molecular biology water. Note: The number of colonies to screen will depend on the number of background colonies on the digested vector control plate.b.  Using the same pipette tips, streak the colonies on a GM17 plate supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and incubate overnight at 30^°C . Note: This plate will later serve to start liquid cultures of positive clones. .  Use 5ul of DNA template (water-bacteria suspension) per 50ul PCR reactions with the Taq DNA Polymerase. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Note: We use the backbone-specific primers Cas9_S.pyo_ F6 and crRNA_S.pyo_R (Table 1) to screen for new spacers in the CRISPR array of pL2Cas9. Amplification of the uncut vector or desired ligation products will both generate an 815 bp fragment. To screen colonies for the right repair template, we use the backbone-specific primers pNZins_F and pNZins_R (Table 1). Amplification of uncut pNZ123 will generate a 145 bp fragment, while the assembled repair template will generate a bigger fragment of variable length.d.  Run the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel (see Recipes) with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder to determine their size.e.  To confirm the sequence of the inserts, submit PCR products for Sanger sequencing. Note: To reduce the number of PCR products sent for sequencing, positive clones can also be identified with insert-specific primers. To screen for new spacers in pL2Cas9, we use the oligo I from Step A2 (Table 1) and crRNA_S.pyo_R. While a positive clone results in the amplification of a 391 bp fragment, a negative clone results in no product.f.  Inoculate 10ml of GM17 broth medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics with positive clones and incubate overnight at 30~^°C .g.  Store cells at -80~^°C by adding 850ul of overnight culture to 150~ul of sterile glycerol.B.  Construction of homologous repair templateWe  use  the  broad-host-range  and  high-copy-number  plasmid  pNZ123  to  construct  our recombination templates. It confers chloramphenicol resistance to the bacterial cells carrying it. To avoid plasmid loss in L. lactis, chloramphenicol is supplied at a final concentration of 5 ug/ml (Cm 5). Other plasmids compatible with pL2Cas9 could be used. Most importantly, the repair template must be designed to lack the Cas9 target sequence so that recombinant phages, and the template itself, can avoid cleavage. The most effective approach is to create a deletion, which removes the whole target sequence (PAM and protospacer) (Figure 3). Otherwise, a single mutation can be introduced in the PAM and/or multiple mutations in the protospacer to prevent DNA cleavage. If the target sequence is in a coding region, mutations should be designed based on codon usage patterns.()Figure 3. Construction of homologous repair template with a desired deletion. Insert A (left) contains the 5' -end of a gene of interest (yellow) and insert B (right) contains the acute3 -end of the same gene. The two fragments, amplified from the phage genome, are the homologous arms of the repair template. The external primers have overlaps (green) for inserting the amplicons into linearized pNZ123 using Gibson Assembly (pNZ_insertA and pNZ_insertB, Table 1). The inner primers have complementary overhangs (yellow) for annealing together. Assembly of the two inserts removes part of the yellow gene, and the target sequence (blue box) is absent from the repair template. A similar strategy can be used to generate deletions, point mutations and insertions.1.  Purification pNZ123a.  Streak L. lactis MG1363 (pNZ123) to a GM17 Cm 5 plate (see Recipes).b.  Incubate overnight at 30^°C .c.  Pick a single colony with a sterile pipette tip using sterile tweezers and drop the tip into 500 ml of GM17 Cm 5 (see Recipes).d.  Incubate statically overnight at 30^°C .e.  Harvest the overnight culture by centrifugation at 6,000× g for 15min .f.  Resuspend the bacterial pellet in ^20~m~ buffer P1 (from QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit) supplemented with lysozyme 30mg/ml .g.  Incubate for 30 min at 37~^°C .h.  Follow QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit protocol.i.  Run a sample of the purified plasmid DNA preparation on a 0.8% agarose gel (see Recipes) with the High DNA Mass Ladder to estimate DNA concentration.j.  Keep the purified plasmid DNA at -20~^°C until needed.2.  Linearization of pNZ123a.  Digest 1~u of purified pNZ123 with XbaI following the manufacturer’s instructions with an overnight incubation at 37^°C .b.  Amplify the digested vector with primers pNZ_XbaI_F and pNZ_XbaI_R (Table 1) and the Q5 DNA polymerase following the manufacturer’s instructions. We use an annealing temperature of 58~^°C and an elongation time of 75 sec. Note: Amplification of the digested vector significantly reduces background from uncut or re-circularized vector.c.  Clean the resulting PCR products with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in molecular biology water.d.  Store the linearized and PCR-amplified pNZ123 at -20~^°C until needed. Note: Aliquot into smaller volumes to prevent DNA degradation that may occur during repeated freeze-thaw cycles.3.  Amplification of inserts (Figure 3)a.  Design primers with overlaps suited for Gibson Assembly into linearized pNZ123. Note: Even though the manufacturer recommends a 20 bp overlap between the fragments to be assembled, we found that >30 bp overlaps significantly increased the efficiency of assembly. While 250-500 bp homologous arms are preferred, shorter arms are generally sufficient for recombination with the phage genome.b.  PCR amplify the inserts with the Q5 DNA polymerase using the phage genome as a template and following the manufacturer’s instructions.c.  Run on a 2% agarose gel with the linearized pNZ123 and both the Low DNA Mass and 1 Kb Plus Ladders in separate wells to confirm and determine the concentration of fragments.4.  Assembly and transformation of the repair templatea.  Assemble the fragments from Steps B1 and B2 using Gibson Assembly Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Note: For best results, assemble and transform the repair template on the same day.b.  Incubate for 1h at 50~^°C .c.  Keep on ice (or -20 ^°C) ) until needed.d.  Prepare competent cells of L . lactis MG1363 (Step A5). Note: The repair template can also be electroporated into L. lactis MG1363 already harboring the targeting plasmid pL2Cas9.e.  Proceed immediately to the electroporation (Steps A6) of the repair template and plate the cells on GM17 supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics.f.  Incubate 24-48~h~ at 30^°C . Note: Selection with two antibiotics often slows down bacterial growth.g.  Analyze the transformants by colony PCR (Step A7).# C.  Phage engineering (Figure 4)We perform double layer plaque assays to obtain isolated phage plaques and purify recombinant phages. This step could easily be adapted to other phage-host pairs, provided that the bacterial host harbors the two DNA constructs obtained in Steps A and B. We do not use antibiotic selection during phage infection since the plasmids are stable in L. lactis MG1363. Plasmid stability may vary in different hosts, and antibiotic selection should be considered in some cases.()Figure 4. Targeted genome editing of phage p2 using CRISPR-Cas9. Phage p2 infects L. lactis MG1363 harboring a targeting plasmid (pL2Cas9) and a repair template. The CRISPR array is depicted as black diamonds (repeats) and a blue box (spacer). Shortly after the viral DNA enters the bacterium, the CRISPR-Cas9 complex recognizes and cleaves its target. The genomic lesion can then be repaired with a template suited for homologous recombination and harboring a desired mutation (here a deletion). Recombinant phages avoid cleavage by the CRISPR-Cas9 system as they lack the target sequence.1.  Phage infectiona.  Inoculate 10m of GM17 supplemented with Em 5 and Cm 5 with L. lactis MG1363 harboring the targeting plasmid and the repair template.b.  Incubate overnight at 30^°C .c.  Perform a ten-fold serial dilution of a phage p2 lysate. Prepare six sterile 1.5ml micro-tubes containing 900~ul of 1× sterile phage buffer (see Recipes). Add 100~ul of undiluted phage lysate to the first micro-tube and mix by gently pipetting up and down. This is dilution 10^-1 . Using a new pipette tip, transfer 100ul of the displaystyle10^-1 dilution to the second micro tube (dilution 10^-2) ), gently mix, and repeat up to dilution 10^-6 .d.  Add 300ul of overnight bacterial culture to 3ml GM17 soft agar medium supplemented with C a c l_2 (see Recipes) kept at 50^°C .e.  Add 100ul of undiluted phage lysate.f.  Pour rapidly on top of a GM17 agar medium supplemented with C a c l_2 and swirl the plate to spread the soft agar evenly.g.  Repeat the last three steps for dilutions 10^-2 , 10^-4 and 10^-6 .h.  Incubate 24~h at 30~^°C .i.  Pick 3 phage plaques with a truncated sterile pipette tip and put each phage-containing agar plug into a separate sterile 1.5m micro-tube containing 500ul of 1× phage buffer. Note: Phage plaques can be kept in buffer at 4^°C for a few weeks.j.  Let the phages diffuse in the buffer for >20 min at RT.k.  Repeat two more rounds of infection on the same bacterial strain (Steps C1a to C1j) to purify the recombinant phages.Mutant phage analysisa.  Design pairs of primers amplifying the mutated region of the phage genome and absent from the repair template.b.  Use 5~ul of the phage suspension per 50 µl PCR reactions with the Taq DNA Polymerase and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Use wild-type phage p2 as a template for positive control.c.  Run the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder to determine their size. Note: Gene deletions can be observed on gel by shorter PCR products obtained with recombinant phages compared to those obtained with the wild-type phage p2.d.  Submit PCR products for Sanger sequencing and align them with the phage genome to confirm the desired mutation in the recombinant phages. Note: Knockout of genes that are nonessential for phage multiplication under laboratory conditions always resulted in a homogeneous population of recombinant phages.e.  Sequence the whole genome of the engineered phages to confirm the absence of additional mutations. Note: To date, we have sequenced the full genome of several mutant phages and no offtarget mutations were detected following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Unexpected mutations could occur if genetic compensation is needed to buffer against deleterious mutations.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Spacer Cloning in pL2Cas9\n## Purification of pL2Cas9\nStreak the

The protocol was generated with the goal of making synthesized non-clonal DNA fragments directly compatible with USERTM cloning. The protocol is highly efficient and would be compatible with uracil-containing non-clonal DNA fragments obtained from any synthesizing company. The protocol drastically reduces time and handling between receiving the synthesized DNA fragments and transforming with vector and DNA fragment(s).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\nA.  For ordering uracil-containing NCDFs\n\n1.  Sequence of DNA to be synthesized (optimized for desired organism) Note: Depending on the fidelity of synthesis, any size of fragment is in principle suitable for synthesis. Until now the maximum size of NCDFs we have been able to order is 3 kb (varies depending on the company) and the fidelity in terms of how many colonies we had to sequence to find a correct clone has generally been 1-2.\n2.  Sequence of USER tails to be added for insertion into USER vector (for single gene insertion)\n3.  Sequence of USER overlaps for seamless USER fusion\nNote: For insertion into USER compatible vectors, the USER tails are given by the USER cassette\nthat has been inserted. Please consult the relevant publications. For USER fusion we typically use\nUSER overlaps between 7-16 bp in length.\n\nB.  For linerarizing USER compatible vector\n\n1. 1.5ml centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf tubes)\n2.  USER compatible vector (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006 and 2010; Geu-Flores et al., 2007)\n3.

CaCl2 competent E. coli cells (DH5α or NEB10β or other common cloning strains) Note: Do not perform transformation by electroshocking as the shock will cause the vector and uNCDF to dissociate.\n3.  uNCDFs from synthesis company (in this case from Thermo Fisher Scientific Geneart) Note: Despite their success, uNCDFs are not yet offered officially by Geneart. Please contact e.g., Anja Martinez at Thermofisher Geneart (anja.martinez@thermofisher.com) or us for ordering questions.\n4.  H2O\n5.  Linearized USER compatible vector Note: A long list of vectors has been made USER cloning compatible for almost all organisms. Search within these three papers (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006 and 2010; Geu-Flores et al., 2007) and the many papers citing them.

Design and order uracil-containing NCDFs for single fragment USER cloningFor cloning single uNCDFs into USER compatible vectors that have been generated by our lab, our generic 5' and acute3 user tails are added to termini of the fragment to be inserted (5’ USER tail: 5' -GGCTTAAU, z USER tail: 5' -GGTTTAAU) (for inserting into other USER compatible vectors please use the corresponding USER tails). When ordering synthesized DNA we typically codon optimize the sequence for the organism wherein the gene will be expressed. In an example below, we show how we ordered the gene AT1G15210 as a uNCDF from Thermo Fisher Scientific Geneart. As instructed by Geneart, we provided them with a word file containing sequences to be synthesized in FASTA format. At the beginning of the word document, we included general instructions to the synthesis company, which are given in italics belowDear synthesis company:Green marks a T in the top strand that must be replaced by a U. Turquoise marks an A, which is complementary to a T on the opposite strand that must be replaced by a U (i.e., it is the T on the opposite strand that must be replaced by a uracil). Yellow marks sequence that may not be altered. Non-marked sequence represents coding sequence, which may be changed to overcome synthesis challenges. The gene will be expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Please use the appropriate codon preference table for codon optimization and alternations.>AT1G152105' -GGCTTAATATGGACTACGATCC AACTTCCAGAGCCGCTAGATTAAACC-3’Note: Punctuation marks approx. 2 kb of sequence that was included in the order but which has been omitted here for brevity. In this example, yellow sequence represents our standard 5’ and 3’ USER tails.B.  Cloning single uNCDFs into linearized USER compatible vector()Figure  1.  Overview  of  the  USER  cloning  technique.  A  USER  cassette  in  a USER-compatible vector (upper left corner) with a restriction site (PacI, light blue) in the middle, one variable nt surrounding it (different for each side, yellow and green), and oppositely oriented nicking sites (Nt.BbvCI, tan). The USER vector is digested with PacI and Nt.BbvCI to generate 8 nt overhangs. A DNA fragment (upper right corner) with uracils at appropriate positions can be generated by PCR as described previously or via synthesis as a uNCDF as described here. Fragment and vector are mixed with USERTM enzyme mix (excising deoxyuridines, pink) and the digested USER-compatible vector. Following brief incubation, the hybridized product can be used to transform E. coli without prior ligation. This figure has been reproduced with permission from (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006).1.  Each fragment is to be surrounded by USER tails that enable insertion into a USER compatible vector. In this example, we use our X. laevis expression vector pNB1u (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006).uNCDFs are mixed directly with the digested pNB1u vector without prior PCR amplification (Figure1).a.  Dilute each uNCDF to 100n g/ul in H_2O (or TE buffer pH 8).b.  The USER-compatible pNB1u X. laevis oocyte expression vector is digested with PacI/Nt.BbvCI overnight, PCR purified and diluted to a concentration of 50ng/ul (as previously described Nour-Eldin et al., 2006 and 2010). Note: If a USER compatible vector is not available, it is possible to generate them via PCR. In that case, the vector backbone is treated as a DNA fragment to be assembled with DNA fragment of interest via USER fusion (please see below).c.  For the USER reaction, mix 100 ng uNCDF with 50 ng digested pNB1u, 1 U USER enzyme (NEB), 2uI5× PCR reaction buffer and 5ulH_2O .d.  Incubate the reaction at 37 ^°C for 25m i n , and then for 25 min at room temperature.e.  Transform 50~ul chemically competent E. . coli cells with the reaction mixture by heat shock (5 min on ice, 30-45 sec at 42^°C and 5 min on ice).f. Plate the transformation mixture on LB-plates containing appropriate antibiotic selection (for pNB1u we use carbenicillin or ampicilin–containing LB plates).g.  Select three colonies from the plates and grow overnight. Extract plasmids and analyze the extracted plasmids by gel-electrophoresis. Sequence the plasmids with an insert.C.  Design and order uracil-containing NCDFs for USER fusion of multiple fragmentsFor fusion of multiple uNCDFs into USER compatible vectors overlap regions have to be selected and included in adjacent fragments. Overlap regions are selected as previously described by finding a T on the bottom strand and a T on the top strand 7-15 bases downstream of the first T. The pair of selected Ts should be within 20-30 bases distance to the junction site (Figure 2) (Geu-Flores et al., 2007; Nour-Eldin et al., 2010). These Ts will be the ones replaced by a U during synthesis. For insertion into the USER compatible vector, our generic 5' and z user tails are added to the terminal fragments. When ordering synthesized DNA we typically codon optimize the sequence for the organism wherein the gene will be expressed. In an example below, we show how we designed and ordered three fragments to be fused and inserted into a USER compatible vector by USER cloning. The full-length sequence (~7,200 bp) was split into three fragments (FAS1_A, FAS1_B and FAS1_C). The sequence of their termini is given below. In each fragment, the punctuation in the middle denotes approximately ^2k b of sequence, which was included in the order but has been omitted here for brevity. Each fragment was designed to include overlap regions to the adjacent fragment close to the junction sites. Please see below and see (Geu-Flores et al., 2007; Nour-Eldin et al., 2010) for more detailed information on how to design USER fusion overlap regions. Alternatively, the Amuser web server tool can deisgn overlap regions for any USER fusion approach (Genee et al., 2015). As instructed by Geneart we provided them with a Word file containing sequences to be synthesized in FASTA format. At the beginning of the Word document, we included general instructions to the synthesis company, which are given in italics below.Dear synthesis company:Green marks a T in the top strand that must be replaced by a U. Turquoise marks an A, which is complementary to a T on the opposite strand that must be replaced by a U (i.e., it is the T on the opposite strand that must be replaced by a uracil).

Fusion and clone of multiple uNCDFs into linearized USER compatible vector()Figure 2. Overview of the USER fusion technique. Fragments X1, X2, and X3 are to be fused together. Overlap regions are marked in grey. Uracils can be inserted via PCR or as described here during synthesis. The DNA fragments are mixed with a pre-digested USER-compatible vector and treated with the deoxyuridine-excising USERTM enzyme mix. This generated acute3 overhangs that complement each other (indicated by arrows), while the outermost ones complemented the overhangs of the pre-digested vector. This design enables the formation of a stable circular hybridization product that can be transformed directly into E. coli without prior ligation. This figure has been reproduced with permission from (Geu-Flores et al., 2007).For fusing and cloning multiple uNCDFs into USER compatible vectors that have been generated by our lab, our generic 8 bp long 5’ and z user tails are added to termini of the terminal fragments. At junction sites uracil-containing overlaps were included to allow seamless fusion upon mixing. When possible we strive to choose fusion overlaps of different lengths and composition to minimize mis-hybridization between fragments. In this example, we fuse and clone three fragments into our X. laevis expression vector pNB1u (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006). Each fragment contained a uracil at the appropriate location in each USER tail. The uracil was incorporated during synthesis. Thus, uNCDFs are mixed in equimolar ratios directly with the digested pNB1u vector without prior PCR amplification with uracil-containing primers.1.  Dilute each uNCDFs to 50ng/ul in H_2O .2.  The  USER-compatible  pNB1u  X.  laevis  oocyte  expression  vector  is  digested  with PacI/Nt.BbvCI overnight, PCR purified and diluted to a concentration of 50~ng/ul (as previously described (Nour-Eldin et al., 2006 and 2010)).3.  For the USER reaction, mix 100 ng of each uNCDFs with 50 ng digested pNB1u, 1 U USER enzyme (NEB), 2uI5× PCR reaction buffer and H_2O to bring the total volume to 10ul .4.  Incubate the reaction at 37~^°C for 25min , and then for 25 min at room temperature.5.  Transform 50~ul chemically competent E. coli cells (for example NEB10β by heat shock) with the reaction mixture (5 min on ice, 30-45 sec at 42^°C and 5 min on ice). Note: Typically the volume of added USER reaction mixture should not exceed 10% of the competent E. coli volume (i.e., max 5 µl reaction mixture to 50 µl E. coli volume, 10 µl reaction mixture to 100 µl E. coli volume etc. Exceeding this ration can reduce transformation efficiency.6.  Plate the transformation mixture on LB-plates containing appropriate antibiotic selection (for pNB1u we used carbenicillin–containing LB plates).7.  Select eight colonies from the plates and grow overnight. Extract plasmids and analyze the extracted plasmids by gel-electrophoresis. Sequence the plasmids with an insert.# NotesIf insertion does not succeed in the first trial, we encourage users–in addition to the USER cloning– to clone the uNCDFs into a blunt-ended cloning vector (such as pJET) for safekeeping and future work.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Design and Order Uracil-Containing NCDFs for Single Fragment USER Cloning\nAdd generic 5' and 3' USER tails to the termini of the fragment to be inserted\nCodon optimize the sequence for the organism wherein the gene will be expressed\nOrder synthesized DNA with the specified sequences and instructions for the synthesis company\n## Cloning Single uNCDFs into Linearized USER Compatible Vector\nDilute each uNCDF to 100 ng/ul in H2O or TE buffer pH 8\n## Prepare the USER-Compatible Vector\nDigest the pNB1u vector with PacI/Nt.BbvCI overnight\nPCR purify and dilute the digested vector to a concentration of 50 ng/ul\n## Perform the USER Reaction\nMix 100 ng uNCDF with 50 ng digested pNB1u, 1 U USER enzyme, 2 ul 5x PCR reaction buffer, and 5 ul H2O\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 25 minutes, and then for 25 minutes at room temperature\n## Transform E. coli and Select Colonies\nTransform 50 ul chemically competent E. coli cells with the reaction mixture by heat shock\nPlate the transformation mixture on LB-plates containing appropriate antibiotic selection\nSelect three colonies from the plates and grow overnight\n## Verify the Clones\nExtract plasmids and analyze the extracted plasmids by gel-electrophoresis\nSequence the plasmids with an insert\n## Design and Order Uracil-Containing NCDFs for USER Fusion of Multiple Fragments\nSelect overlap regions for adjacent fragments\nAdd generic 5' and 3' USER tails to the terminal fragments\nOrder synthesized DNA with the specified sequences and instructions for the synthesis company\n## Fusion and Clone of Multiple uNCDFs into Linearized USER Compatible Vector\nDilute each uNCDF to 50 ng/ul in H2O\n## Prepare the USER-Compatible Vector\nDigest the pNB1u vector with PacI/Nt.BbvCI overnight\nPCR purify and dilute the digested vector to a concentration of 50 ng/ul\n## Perform the USER Reaction\nMix 100 ng of each uNCDF with 50 ng digested pNB1u, 1 U USER enzyme, 2 ul 5x PCR reaction buffer, and H2O to bring the total volume to 10 ul\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 25 minutes, and then for 25 minutes at room temperature\n## Transform E. coli and Select Colonies\nTransform 50 ul chemically competent E. coli cells with the reaction mixture by heat shock\nPlate the transformation mixture on LB-plates containing appropriate antibiotic selection\nSelect eight colonies from the plates and grow overnight\n## Verify the Clones\nExtract plasmids and analyze the extracted plasmids by gel-electrophoresis\nSequence the plasmids with an insert","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Synthetic Biology & Bioengineering"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2594","title":"Purifying Properly Folded Cysteine-rich, Zinc Finger Containing Recombinant Proteins for Structural Drug Targeting Studies: the CH1 Domain of p300 as a Case Example","text":"Purifying Properly Folded Cysteine-rich, Zinc Finger Containing Recombinant Proteins for Structural Drug Targeting Studies: the CH1 Domain of p300 as a Case Example\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) complexes with the coactivator p300, activating the hypoxia response pathway and allowing tumors to grow. The CH1 and CAD domains of each respective protein form the interface between p300 and HIF. Small molecule compounds are in development that target and inhibit HIF/p300 complex formation, with the goal of reducing tumor growth. High resolution NMR spectroscopy is necessary to study ligand interaction with p300-CH1, and purifying high quantities of properly folded p300-CH1 is needed for pursuing structural and biophysical studies. p300-CH1 has 3 zinc fingers and 9 cysteine residues, posing challenges associated with reagent compatibility and protein oxidation. A protocol has been developed to overcome such issues by incorporating zinc during expression and streamlining the purification time, resulting in a high yield of optimally folded protein (120 mg per 4 L expression media) that is suitable for structural NMR studies. The structural integrity of the final recombinant p300-CH1 has been verified to be optimal using onedimensional ^1H NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism. This protocol is applicable for the purification of other zinc finger containing proteins.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 14ml polypropylene round-bottom tube (Corning, Falcon®, catalog number: 352057)\n2. 1.7ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube (Posi-Click Eppendorf) (Denville Scientific, catalog number: C2170)\n3.

Preparing bacterial expression stock (DAYS 1-2) 1.  Transform BL21 (DE3) bacteria with the p300-CH1 expression vector (pGEX-6P-1 plasmid containing the p300-CH1 insert) using the basic protocol outlined for the One Shot® BL21 Star (DE3) Chemically Competent E. coli. 2.  Autoclave 4 L of LB Miller broth, and allow the media to cool at room temperature. Once the broth is cool to the touch, add ampicillin to a final concentration of 100uM . 3.  Pick six colonies, and inoculate each colony in 5ml of autoclaved LB Miller broth supplemented with 100uM ampicillin in a 14ml polypropylene round-bottom tube.4.  Incubate overnight at 37^°C using the FormaOrbital Shaker at a speed of 242 rpm.5.  Select samples that show bacterial growth, and properly discard any samples without growth.6.  Isolate plasmid from a small sample of the growth media (3 ml) using a GeneJet mini kit (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/MAN0013117_GeneJET_Plasmid_Minipre p_UG.pdf).7.  Verify presence of pGEX-6P-1 vector (4,984 bp) containing insert coding for p300-CH1 (318 bp) by performing restriction digestion with enzymes (BamHI and EcoRI). Prepare the following samples: a. 10ul Quick-Load 1 kb DNA ladder b.  Undigested plasmid: 15ul of 50n g/ul DNA, 5ul of 5× nucleic acid sample loading buffer, 5 ul deionized water c.

Prepare 50% glycerol stocks of the bacteria that contain the desired plasmid by mixing 0.5ml of bacteria with 0.5ml of autoclaved 100% glycerol in autoclaved 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes.10. Homogenize by gently inverting tube 3 times and store the 50% glycerol BL21 (DE3) stocks at - 80~^°C .11. Scratch frozen 50% glycerol plasmid-containing BL21 (DE3) stock with a micropipette tip, and spread onto ampicillin LB-agar plates.12. Incubate the plate overnight at 37^°CB.  Overnight culture for bacterial expression (2 h) (DAY 3)1.  Pipette three samples of 10mI of autoclaved LB Miller broth into a 50~ml conical bottom polypropylene tube, and add ampicillin to a final concentration of 100uM . 2.  Inoculate each 10ml LB sample with a single plasmid-containing BL21 (DE3) colony. 3.  Incubate at 37^°C overnight in an orbital shaker under gentle agitation (242 rpm).C.  Large batch plasmid growth (3-4 h) (DAY 4)1.  Remove flasks containing 4 L LB Miller broth from the cold room, and allow to warm to room temperature. 2.  Add ampicillin and Zn c l_2 (both used at final concentrations of 100uM) .4 ml of 100m M ampicillin stock4 ml of 100 mM ZnCl2 stock Note: Save 1 ml aliquot in spectrophotometer cuvette for OD600 Blank.3.  Remove the ^20 m l BL21 (DE3) overnight bacterial culture, and evenly distribute to 4 L LB Miller broth.4.  Incubate bacteria at 37^°C at 242 rpm using the orbital shaker until OD600 is 0.5-0.7. Note: Take ~1 ml aliquots every 30 min starting at _3h to measure OD600.D.  Inducing protein expression (5 h) (DAY 4)1.  Remove LB bacterial culture flasks from the orbital shaker and add IPTG to a final concentration of 100uM using the 10,000× IPTG stock.2.  Incubate bacteria at room temperature (22~textdegreeC) for 5h under gentle agitation (242 rpm) in benchtop horizontal shaker (SK-300).3.  Pour 1.2L bacterial growth media into four 250~ml wide-mouth plastic bottles, and balance the masses of the bottles. Note: Leave the remainder of the growth media at room temperature.4.  Pellet bacteria by centrifuging at 4,000xg at 4~^°C for 15 min in Beckman Coulter Avanti Centrifuge (J-20XP) using the JLA-16.250 rotor.5.  Discard the supernatant into 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100ml of Bleach.6.  Repeat steps D3-D5 until all 4L of bacteria have been pelleted.7.  Scrape the pellet with a spatula (15-25 g per 4 L bacterial expression) and transfer into a 50ml conical bottom polypropylene tube.8.  Flash freeze bacterial pellet by plunging tube in a container filled with liquid nitrogen, and keep in -80~^°C freezer.9.  Dispose of the bleached supernatant into the sink.E.  Lysing bacterial pellet (5 h) (DAY 5)1.  Thaw the bacterial pellet on ice or in a cold room.2.  Re-suspend pellet in _25ml acidic resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.3, see Recipes).3.  Add 15~ul DNAase I ( :1 m g/ m l) , 15~ul RNase A, and 3-5 mg of PEFA-BLOC and benzamidine protease inhibitors.4.  Insert a stir bar, and stir in the cold room (4^°C) for 1 h.5.  Homogenize suspended pellet using the high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex C5), cooled with the Fisher Scientific Isotherm Model 900 cooler (setup is pictured in Figure 1). Notes: a.  p300-CH1 is temperature sensitive, and the traditional method of lysing bacteria by alternating between freezing (ice lattice damage; ‘freeze burn’) and thawing (protein melting) are unsuitable.b.  If high-pressure homogenizer is unavailable, sonication at a constant temperature of 4 ^° C may be a suitable alternative.()Figure 1. High-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex C5), cooled with the Fisher Scientific Isotherm Model 900 cooler6.  Spin down lysate at RCF 205,076xg for 1 h at 4^°C in Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using Ti-40 rotor.7.  Transfer clarified bacterial lysate (containing soluble bacterial components) into 50~ml conical bottom polypropylene tubes. Note: Save a 14 µl aliquot for SDS-PAGE to verify that expression has occurred (see sample #1 in Figure 2).F.  Capturing and purifying GST tagged p300-CH1 protein (4 h) (DAY 5)1.  Add 3 ml of GSH-Agarose beads into 50ml conical-bottom polypropylene tubes. Note: Cut the very end of the micropipette tip to aspirate agarose beads.2.  Wash away preservatives and ethanol from beads by filling up to 50~ml with pre-chilled acidic resuspension buffer.3.  Spin the beads at 700xg for 15 min at 4^°C , and decant the supernatant.4.  Repeat steps F2-F3 to further clean the beads, leaving sedimented beads with as little buffer as possible to accommodate for lysate.5.  To lysate, add 3ml of GSH-Agarose beads, prewashed twice with acidic resuspension buffer to remove ethanol and preservatives.6.  Rotate gently at 4^°C for 3-4h using the vertical rotating shaker (8 rpm).7.  Spin down beads at 700xg for 15 min at 4^°C to sediment beads using a Benchtop Centrifuge (Sorvall ST16R) with a Swinging Bucket Rotor (TX-400). Note: Save a 14 µl aliquot of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE to verify efficiency of GST-tagged recombinant protein capture (see sample #2 in Figure 2).8.  Wash beads 5 times with 50~ml of prechilled acidic resuspension buffer to eliminate excess ZnCl2. Note: Collect 1 ml aliquots of the supernatant after each wash and spin down. Collect UV spectra after each wash and monitor the 260/280 nm absorbance ratios. Wash the beads until the 260/280 nm ratio is below 1.0, which indicates that the sample is free of DNA contamination (https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/application-notes/pathlength/calculatingnucleic-acid-or-protein-concentration-using-the-glomax-multi-microplate-instrument.pdf?la=en).9.  Wash beads 5 times with 50ml of prechilled alkaline resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, see Recipes) to reestablish alkaline pH for protease activity.10. After the final alkaline buffer wash, decant the supernatant and transfer the sedimented GSHAgarose beads into a 15ml polypropylene tube. The final product of Procedure F is GST-tagged p300-CH1 immobilized to GSH-Agarose beads. Note: Save a 10 µl aliquot of beads after final wash for SDS-PAGE to verify purity of captured GST-tagged p300-CH1 after buffer washing (see sample #3 in Figure 2).# G. Inducing cleavage (DAY 5)1.  Add 10 m of HRV 3C Protease buffer (see Recipes) to the GST-tagged p300-CH1 protein immobilized to GSH-Agarose beads in the 15ml conical bottom polypropylene tube. Note: HRV 3C protease is a cysteine protease that needs reducing agents to maintain its activity. Due to precipitation issues associated with zinc and thiol-based reducing agents, use non-thiol based reducing agents like TCEP.2.  Add 100ul HRV 3C PreScission site Protease (2m g/m l) .3.  Gently rotate at 4^°C for 16-18h using a vertical rotating wheel (8 rpm).H.  Purifying cleaved p300-CH1 protein (DAY 6)1.  Remove overnight cleavage mixture from the vertical rotating wheel.2.  Spin down beads at 700 x g for 15 min at 4~^°C using Benchtop Centrifuge (Sorvall) with a Swinging Bucket Rotor (Thermo Scientific TX-400), and transfer supernatant into a new 15~ml polypropylene tube. Notes: a.  Save a 10 µl aliquot of beads for SDS-PAGE to verify completion of cleavage (only cleaved GST tag should be present; see sample #4 in Figure 2). b.  Save a 14 µl aliquot of supernatant for SDS-PAGE to verify presence of cleaved recombinant p300-CH1 (see sample #5 in Figure 2).3.  Wash the GSH-Agarose beads twice with alkaline resuspension buffer, then add 2 ml of GSHAgarose beads to capture cleaved GST, uncleaved GST-p300-CH1, and HRV 3C Protease.4.  Gently rotate the supernatant at 4^°C for 3-4h in cold room with the vertical rotating wheel (8 rpm).5.  Spin down beads at 700xg for 15 min at 4^°C using Sorvall Benchtop Centrifuge with a Swinging Bucket Rotor, and collect supernatant as the final product sample. Notes: a.  Save a 10 µl aliquot of beads for SDS-PAGE to verify elimination of protease byproducts (see sample #6 in Figure 2). b.  Save a 14 µl aliquot of protein product for SDS-PAGE to verify purity of product (see sample #7 in Figure 2).6.  The final p300-CH1 recombinant protein sample should be at a concentration of around 800uM ( 12ml total volume).7.  Divide 800uM recombinant p300-CH1 protein into 500ul aliquots, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80~^°C . Repeated freeze-thaw cycles may degrade the protein concentration by around 10% .\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Bacterial Expression Stock\nVerify all materials and reagents are available and

The hypothalamus itself can be considered an endocrine brain region of some sort as it hosts in its different nuclei several kinds of neuropeptide-producing and - secreting neurons.

Perifusion flow chart. After a ^2-h perifusion to reach equilibrium, the sampling procedure consists of a 30-min control basal period, a 30-min period during which drugs areadded independently or in combination and a 60-min wash with the medium. After each experiment, an appropriate molecule (e.g., KCl) is applied to control the responsiveness of hypothalamic explants and test tissue viability.1.  Prepare sufficient hypothalamic explants perifusion medium for the whole experiment (see Recipes; prepare always fresh and no earlier than one day before, stored at 4^°C ).2.  Prepare the stimulation solutions. For example, we have used iso-osmotic 60 mM KCl (see Recipes).3.  Pre-gas some hypothalamic explant perifusion medium with carbogen (5%C O_2/95%igcirc_: 2; all pregassing and gassing steps use carbogen) in a 50mI conical tube for at least 15 min. About 10 ml of the pre-gassed medium will be used ice-cold for brain dissection and hypothalamic collection and the other part, about 40ml , will be used warmed (34-37^°C) in a thermostatic bath for perifusion.4.  Prepare perifusion chamber filters (Biorep) for each chamber (2 per chamber) with a hole puncher. Place one filter at each open end of the chamber (see Figures 2F-2H).()Figure 2. Representative images of the different steps of perifusion experiment. A. Place the mouse brain upside down in a Petri dish containing ice-cold basic medium with the hypothalamus in front of the experimenter (A, B, C and D refer to step 8); B. Remove the cerebellum with a scalpel; C. Recover the hypothalamus with curved Dumont #7 forceps; D. Collect the hypothalamus (shown by the arrow and dashed circle) in a new Petri dish containing ice-cold basic medium; E. To avoid damage to hypothalamus, it can be handled with a large plastic/glass pipette; F. Prior to dissection, prepare perifusion chamber filters; G. Sagittal view of the brain showing the hypothalamus position (a circle in dotted-line is drawn around the hypothalamus); H. Put one filter at each end of the perifusion chamber (step 4);  Prefill  the perifusion chambers with warmed pre-gassed perifusion medium (as described in step 6); I. Position the hypothalamus in the center of the perifusion chamber (step 9). Close the chamber and put it back in the thermostatic bath at 37~^°C (step 10); J. Complete assembly of the experimental set-up with, in line from right to left, a thermostatic bath at 37~^°C which contains tubes filled with perifusion medium (tubes are connected one to one with silicon tubing to perifusion chambers), a peristaltic pump flows the perifusion medium, a second thermostatic bath at 37~^°C which receives the perifusion chambers (a perifusion chamber is marked by the red dashed line circle) and, left, the outlet of the perifusion chambers is connected with silicon tubing to low protein absorption 1.5~ml microtubes placed on ice to collect fractions. The perifusion medium flows from right to left.5.  Connect with appropriate tubing (low protein absorption tubing such as Teflon tubing) the inlet of the perifusion chambers that will contain the hypothalamic explants to a peristaltic pump on one side and the outlet of the chambers to the tubing for fraction collection on the other side.6.  Prefill the perifusion chambers with warmed pre-gassed perifusion medium. Chambers and tubing will be themselves kept at 34-37^°C in a thermostatic bath.7.  For every mouse previously euthanized (we use cervical dislocation–chosen method should be fast in order to preserve tissue as much as possible), cut the head and collect the mouse brain in a Petri dish filled with pre-gassed perifusion medium, cooled on ice. To collect the brain, insert the bottom blade of extra thin iris scissors into the foramen magnum, and begin to cut directly up and through the midline of the skull, being careful to keep scissor tips pointed upwards. Then, open the skull using forceps pushing outwards both halves of the skull, thus exposing the brain. Carefully invert the skull: gravity will help the brain to detach from the skull. Using Dumont #7 forceps, carefully slide the forceps along the outer edge of the brain and under the brain from the olfactory lobes, towards the cerebellum. Gently detach the brain from any connective tissue or nerves that prevent it from falling from the skull.Note: We used vartheta -week old mice. Users will determine this regarding each scientific project. A limitation is of course the volume of the perifusion chamber that receives the hypothalamus.8.  Extract the hypothalami (see Figure 2A). Place the brain upside down in a Petri dish (i.e., the ventral side up and visible and the dorsal side of the brain on the Petri dish bottom) filled with ice-cold perifusion medium (see Figure 2A), cut out the cerebellum and spinal cord parts with a scalpel (see Figure 2B) and isolate the hypothalamus using curved Dumont #7 forceps (see Figure 2C): go carefully as deep as 2 mm around the hypothalamic and circle around them to separate and collect them from the brain. More than one brain can be processed in the same dish. Collect all hypothalamic explants in another Petri dish (see Figure 2D), filled with pregassed perifusion medium cooled on ice.9.  Once all hypothalami are collected, place them immediately in perifusion chambers previously filled, thanks to the peristaltic pump, with gassed and warmed perifusion medium (step 6). Open one end of the chamber and gently deposit the hypothalami in the chamber. Be careful not to block the perifusion flow by having tissues sticking to one end of the perifusion chamber (i.e., don’t push the tissues to close to one end of the chamber or carefully reposition the tissue in the center of the chamber). Close the perifusion chamber (see Figure 2I).Note: We used 3 hypothalami per chamber to increase the quantity of peptide release per chamber in order to be able to quantify the release of MCH with ELISA. The number of hypothalami should be determined depending on the experimental setup and conditions (i.e., the neuropeptide of interest, the stimulation of the hypothalami used to release this peptide, and the peptide quantification method).10. Place the perifusion chambers containing the hypothalamic explants to the thermostatic bath (34-37^°C) ) where they will remain during the whole experiment.11. Perifuse hypothalamic explants with gassed and warm (34-37 ^°C) ) perifusion medium for ^2~h~ prior to any stimulation of the hypothalami in order to establish a baseline level of peptide release by hypothalami. The inlet tubing for the chambers is placed in a bottle containing the perifusion medium. The flow of perifusion medium that goes in the chambers is set with a peristaltic pump at the rate of 0.1 ml/1 min. This rate will be used for the whole experiment.12. Collect 3 fractions of the baseline perifusate (1 fraction per 10 min perifusion, and fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). Each fraction from each chamber will be collected in a separate 1.5ml microtube in which the outlet tubing will have been previously placed. Aliquot the collected 1-ml perifusate and freeze at -80~^°C as quickly as possible to avoid peptide degradation.13. Once the baseline fractions are collected, pause the peristaltic pump to eliminate the risk of introducing air bubble in the superfusion tubing and prepare the tubes with the stimulation medium: the inlet tubing for each chamber should be appropriately placed in the corresponding pre-gassed and warmed stimulation solution before starting the peristaltic pump again.14. Stimulation will last no longer than 30 min to avoid toxicity and/or desensitization of the tissue. During this step, 3 fractions will be collected (1 fraction = 10 min, fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). The collected fractions of 1-ml perifusate are aliquoted and freezed at - 80^°C rapidly to avoid degradation.15. Once the stimulation fractions are collected, pause the peristaltic pump and start a 60-min washout period: place the inlet tubing for each chamber into the bottle containing the gassed and warmed (34-37~^°C) hypothalamic explant perifusion medium. During this step, 6 fractions will be collected (1 fraction =~10 min, fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). Aliquot the collected 1 ml perifusate and freeze at -80~^°C as soon as possible to avoid degradation.16. After the washout, you can stimulate again all your hypothalamic explants with the appropriate stimulus to induce the release of your neuropeptide of interest in order to control for the viability of the hypothalamic explants–30 min maximum. During this step, 3 fractions will be collected (1fraction =10m i n , fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). Aliquot the collected 1- ml perifusate and freeze at -80~^°C as soon as possible to avoid degradation.17. Turn off the pump. Hypothalamic explants can be saved for further analysis. Explants are collected either with forceps, delicately, or by centrifugation of the chamber in a microtube at 4^°C (see details on Biorep’s website). Freeze at -80~^°C .18. Wash thoroughly the whole perifusion system (tubing and perifusion chambers) with at least 200 ml of hot autoclaved ultrapure water (pump tubing should be reusable up to 20 times depending on the tubing material).19. Quantify the amount/concentration of secreted neuropeptides by ELISA, RIA, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry or other suitable method.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Hypothalamic Explant Perifusion Medium\nPrepare sufficient hypothalamic explant perifusion medium for the whole experiment, fresh and no earlier than one day before, stored at 4°C.\nPrepare the stimulation solutions, for example, iso-osmotic 60 mM KCl.\n## Pre-gassing and Preparation of Perifusion Chamber\nPre-gas some hypothalamic explant perifusion medium with carbogen in a 50ml conical tube for at least 15 min.\nPrepare perifusion chamber filters with a hole puncher and place one filter at each open end of the chamber.\nPrefill the perifusion chambers with warmed pre-gassed perifusion medium.\n## Setup of Perifusion System\nConnect the inlet of the perifusion chambers to a peristaltic pump and the outlet to the tubing for fraction collection.\nPlace the perifusion chambers in a thermostatic bath at 34-37°C.\n## Brain Dissection and Hypothalamic Collection\nCut the head and collect the mouse brain in a Petri dish filled with pre-gassed perifusion medium, cooled on ice.\nExtract the hypothalami and place them in a Petri dish filled with ice-cold perifusion medium.\nCollect all hypothalamic explants in another Petri dish filled with pre-gassed perifusion medium cooled on ice.\n## Perifusion of Hypothalamic Explants\nPlace the hypothalami in the perifusion chambers previously filled with gassed and warmed perifusion medium.\nPerifuse the hypothalamic explants with gassed and warm perifusion medium for 2 hours prior to any stimulation.\nCollect 3 fractions of the baseline perifusate, each fraction collected 10 min apart from each other.\n## Stimulation and Fraction Collection\nPrepare the tubes with the stimulation medium and place the inlet tubing for each chamber in the corresponding pre-gassed and warmed stimulation solution.\nStimulate the hypothalamic explants for no longer than 30 min and collect 3 fractions, each fraction collected 10 min apart from each other.\nPause the peristaltic pump and start a 60-min washout period, collecting 6 fractions, each fraction collected 10 min apart from each other.\n## Control for Viability and Cleanup\nStimulate the hypothalamic explants again with the appropriate stimulus to control for viability.\nTurn off the pump and save the hypothalamic explants for further analysis.\nWash thoroughly the whole perifusion system with at least 200 ml of hot autoclaved ultrapure water.\n## Quantification of Secreted Neuropeptides\nQuantify the amount/concentration of secreted neuropeptides by ELISA, RIA, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry or other suitable method.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Neuroscience Methods"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2656","title":"Trace Fear Conditioning: Procedure for Assessing Complex Hippocampal Function in Mice","text":"Trace Fear Conditioning: Procedure for Assessing Complex Hippocampal Function in Mice\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe trace fear conditioning protocol is designed to measure hippocampal function in mice. The protocol includes a neutral conditioned stimulus (tone) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (shock), separated in time by a trace interval. The trace interval between the tone and the shock critically involves the hippocampus and could be used to evaluate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In this protocol, we presented mice with five pairings of tone and shock separated by a 20 sec trace interval. Freezing was measured 24h after conditioning to evaluate contextual memory by placing mice in the conditioned chamber. In addition, 48~h~ after conditioning, freezing was measured in a dark chamber, which served as a different context. This method enables precise detection of hippocampaldependent learning and memory following pharmacological and genetic manipulations that impair or enhance hippocampal function.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n# 1.

For the TFC protocol, place mice in a chamber (with a 20 W bulb and a 16-bar metal grid floor) for 120 sec. Apply a 2.9k H z tone for 20 sec at 80 dB (conditioned stimulus, CS) and a 0.5m A foot shock for 2 sec (unconditioned stimulus, US) at the end of the 20 sec trace interval.4.  Repeat the previous step four times and separate each trial by a 120 sec inter trial interval (ITI).5.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2675","title":"Context-driven Salt Seeking Test (Rats)","text":"Context-driven Salt Seeking Test (Rats)\n\n# Abstract\n\nChanges in reward seeking behavior often occur through incremental learning based on the difference between what is expected and what actually happens. Behavioral flexibility of this sort requires experience with rewards as better or worse than expected. However, there are some instances in which behavior can change through non-incremental learning, which requires no further experience with an outcome. Such an example of non-incremental learning is the salt appetite phenomenon. In this case, animals such as rats will immediately seek out a highly-concentrated salt solution that was previously undesired when they are put in a novel state of sodium deprivation. Importantly, this adaptive salt-seeking behavior occurs despite the fact that the rats never tasted salt in the depleted state, and therefore never tasted it as a highly desirable reward.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Preparation of animalsThis procedure is designed for rats as the subjects. Rats are food restricted and maintained at 85% of their ad libitum weights throughout the experiment to motivate them to drink the sucrose and salt solutions.B.  Preparation of apparatus1.  Behavioral training is conducted in a custom-designed place preference chamber (29.5×12.5 ×21 in.), which we had made by the Dartmouth Apparatus Shop (Figure 1). The outside walls of the chamber are made of transparent acrylic, and there are acrylic inserts that can be placed in the chamber to divide it into three separate contexts. All training and testing is conducted in the dark except for the red light provided by the portable luminaires (see Figure 1) to provide enough illumination for recording purposes.()Figure 1. Setup for investigating context-driven salt seeking and close up views of the place preference chamber2.  Two contexts ( 12.5×12.5×18.5i n.) within the chamber are paired with one of two solutions, while the third middle context (5×12.5×18.5 in.) connects the other two contexts and is paired with nothing. One of the paired contexts is designated the Grid context. The Grid context has a transparent acrylic floor in a grid-like pattern with electrical tape on the outside walls that form a grid-like pattern. The other paired context is designated the Striped context. The Striped context has the same grid-patterned floor, but the outside walls have electrical tape in a parallel diagonal pattern. Each of these two contexts also has a distinctive object to aid in discrimination (e.g., a metal binder clip or an empty plastic microscope coverslip case). Both contexts have holes on either end to allow for a spout connected to a bottle filled with a solution to be available for the rats to drink from.3.  The third, middle context that connects the Grid and Striped contexts is designated the Neutral context that consists only of clear acrylic walls and is the starting point for each training and testing session. Although individual rats can sometimes naturally favor one context, it is important to first establish that there is no general bias towards one context of the other. If there is, adjustments can be made (e.g., to the lighting, chamber orientation, etc.).# bio-protocolC.  Behavioral training and testing protocolStep 1: Training1.  Rats undergo 8 days of initial training in which they learn to associate one context (Grid or Striped) with access to 3% sucrose in distilled water, and the other context with access to 3% salt in distilled water. Each solution is mixed with 2 of sugar-free Kool-Aid powder (orange or grape) to aid discrimination between the two contexts and solutions. The assignment of context, solution, and Kool-Aid flavor pairings are counterbalanced across rats but kept constant within each rat.2.  On each training day (4 days total in each context), rats are placed into the Neutral context and allowed to freely explore one context (Grid or Striped) for 20 min. Access to the other paired context is blocked. During these sessions, rats are allowed to freely drink from a bottle of 100 ml of either sucrose or salt (orange and purple bottles as in Step 1 of Figure 2). The order of context exposure is pseudorandomly assigned between rats.()Figure 2. Behavioral training and testing procedure to investigate context-driven salt seeking in rats. Step 1: Rats are trained over 8 days to associate one context with access to sucrose (e.g., Grid) and another context with access to salt (e.g., Striped). Step 2: Rats are then given a baseline test session in which they have access to both contexts without sucrose or salt (but flavored solutions still present). Following 4 days of retraining (2 days in each context), rats are then depleted of bodily sodium through furosemide injections (i.p.). Step 3: After 48h , rats are placed back into the chamber for a depletion test that is identical to the baseline test session. Step 4: Finally, rats are given a consumption test that is identical to the previous test sessions but sucrose and salt are now available. All training and testing sessions are 20 min in length.# Step 2: Baseline test1.  Once initial training is complete, rats are then given a 20 min baseline preference test in which they are allowed to explore the entire chamber, including both the Grid and Striped contexts, for the first time (both wall inserts are removed). The Grid and Striped contexts in this test session are identical as in training. One important exception is that sucrose and salt are not present in the flavored solutions. We conduct the baseline preference test in this way to gauge rats’ ability to use the contextual cues of the chamber to guide their behavior. The test serves as an important comparison point for an identical test conducted after sodium depletion.Retraining and sodium depletion1.  Following the baseline test session, the rats are given an additional 4 days of training (2 sessions in each context) that is identical to the initial training sessions (Step 1). We give rats an additional 4 days of training to re-strengthen the associations between sucrose and salt with their respective contexts, which may be weakened following the baseline preference test. After the final training session, rats are given systemic injections of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/ml/kg; i.p.; Merck). In order to maintain sodium deprivation, rats are also maintained on a sodium-free diet (TestDiet) and distilled water immediately following furosemide injections.# Step 3: Depletion test1.  Forty-eight hours after the furosemide injection, rats are then given another context preference test (depletion test). This test is identical to the baseline preference test (i.e., the full chamber is accessible; flavored solutions are available, but contain no salt or sucrose), except now the rats are sodium-deprived. We perform the depletion test this way in order to directly compare the elevation in time spent in the salt-paired context following sodium depletion compared to the baseline preference test.# Step 4: Consumption test1.  The next day, rats are given a final context preference test with sucrose and salt now present in the flavored solutions (consumption test). This allows us the opportunity to confirm that rats are indeed sodium-depleted. It also further provides an opportunity to investigate any possible neural dissociations between context-driven salt seeking (depletion test) and the consumption of salt (consumption test) following sodium depletion. Upon completion of this test, rats are placed back on their normal food and water diet.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Animals\nRats are food restricted and maintained at 85% of their ad libitum weights throughout the experiment to motivate them to drink the sucrose and salt solutions.\n## Preparation of Apparatus\n## Place Preference Chamber Setup\nThe outside walls of the chamber are made of transparent acrylic, and there are acrylic inserts that can be placed in the chamber to divide it into three separate contexts.\nAll training and testing is conducted in the dark except for the red light provided by the portable luminaires to provide enough illumination for recording purposes.\n## Context Setup\nTwo contexts within the chamber are paired with one of two solutions, while the third middle context connects the other two contexts and is paired with nothing.\nOne of the paired contexts is designated the Grid context, and the other paired context is designated the Striped context.\nEach of these two contexts also has a distinctive object to aid in discrimination, and both contexts have holes on either end to allow for a spout connected to a bottle filled with a solution to be available for the rats to drink from.\n## Neutral Context Setup\nThe third, middle context that connects the Grid and Striped contexts is designated the Neutral context, which consists only of clear acrylic walls and is the starting point for each training and testing session.\nAlthough individual rats can sometimes naturally favor one context, it is essential to first establish that there is no general bias towards one context or the other.\n## Behavioral Training and Testing Protocol\n## Training\nRats undergo 8 days of initial training in which they learn to associate one context with access to 3% sucrose in distilled water, and the other context with access to 3% salt in distilled water.\nEach solution is mixed with 2% sugar-free Kool-Aid powder to aid discrimination between the two contexts and solutions.\nThe assignment of context, solution, and Kool-Aid flavor pairings are counterbalanced across rats but kept constant within each rat.\n## Baseline Test\nOnce initial training is complete, rats are then given a 20-minute baseline preference test in which they are allowed to explore the entire chamber, including both the Grid and Striped contexts, for the first time.\nThe Grid and Striped contexts in this test session are identical to those in training, except that sucrose and salt are not present in the flavored solutions.\n## Retraining and Sodium Depletion\nFollowing the baseline test session, the rats are given an additional 4 days of training that is identical to the initial training sessions.\nAfter the final training session, rats are given systemic injections of the diuretic furosemide, and maintained on a sodium-free diet and distilled water immediately following furosemide injections.\n## Depletion Test\nForty-eight hours after the furosemide injection, rats are then given another context preference test, which is identical to the baseline preference test, except that the rats are now sodium-deprived.\n## Consumption Test\nThe next day, rats are given a final context preference test with sucrose and salt now present in the flavored solutions.\nThis test allows for the confirmation of sodium depletion and the investigation of any possible neural dissociations between context-driven salt seeking and the consumption of salt following sodium depletion.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Neuroscience Methods"}}

Stoller1, *\n\n# Abstract\n\nCystinuria is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent, painful kidney stones, primarily composed of cystine, the dimer of the amino acid cysteine (Sumorok and Goldfarb, 2013). Using a mouse model of cystinuria, we have recently shown that administration of drugs that increase cystine solubility in the urine can be a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of the disease (Zee et al., 2017). There is a large unmet need in the field for developing new drugs for cystinuria. To that end, here we describe a simple in vitro cystine solubility assay that is amenable for screening compounds to identify potential drugs that may influence cystine solubility. The assay includes preparing a supersaturated solution of cystine, incubating this solution with drug(s) of choice, and finally using high pressure liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to quantify the amount of cystine precipitated under various conditions.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Prepare 2 L of 20~m M ammonium acetate in HPLC-grade water. This will be used for HPLC sample preparation, as well as to make one of the HPLC mobile phases. Note: 2 L is a suggested volume, adjust based on the anticipated number of drugs being tested.2.  Adjust pH of this solution to 9.0-9.5 (this does not have to be accurate or reproducible) by adding ammonium hydroxide in batches of 0.5~ml followed by pH measurement. A standard pH meter can be used for the purpose; however, it is recommended that the pH probe not be dipped directly in the solution. Instead, a small aliquot (0.5–1 ml) should be transferred to a culture tube for each round of pH measurement.Caution: Ammonium hydroxide is highly corrosive; gloves, safety goggles, and lab coat should be worn at all times while handling this compound. It is also advisable to handle it only inside a chemical safety hood.3.  Measure 950~ml of this pH-adjusted 20m M ammonium acetate solution in a clean glass bottle (1 L) and add 50~ml of acetonitrile (ACN), using appropriate glass cylinders. This will be used as mobile phase A for HPLC. Note: This solution can be stored for 2 weeks at room temperature. Bottles and glass cylinders should be thoroughly cleaned first with HPLC water and then with ACN prior to their use (detergents/soaps should be strictly avoided).4.  Measure 1 L of ACN to another clean glass bottle (1 L). This will be used as mobile phase B for HPLC. Note: ACN can be stored in the dark at room temperature and used for up to 6 months.5.  Take 400ml pH-adjusted 20m M ammonium acetate solution (from step A2) in a 500ml glass bottle. Weight out 29.2 mg of 3,3,3^,3^-d_4 -L-cystine (referred to as d_4 -CC) into this solution and mix well to dissolve and generate a 300uM solution of d_4 -CC. Note: This solution can be aliquoted and stored for several months at -20~^°C .6.  Prepare adequate amount of 30~uM d_4 -CC solution from this 300~uM solution of d_4 -CC, by diluting (10 folds) with pH-adjusted 20m M ammonium acetate solution (from step A2). Note: This solution should be prepared fresh for each batch. 3.6m of this solution will be used as internal standard per vial used in the assay–calculate the amount required based on the number of drugs (and replicates) being tested.7.  Prepare 500~ul each of 2.5m M and 250~uM solutions of DL-cystine dimethyl ester (CDME) in HPLC-grade water (5x). CDME is used as a positive control for the assay as it has been shown to significantly increase cystine solubility (Rimer et al., 2010; Zee et al., 2017).8.  Prepare test drugs solutions (5×) : weigh out test drugs and dissolve in HPLC-grade water to achieve concentrations 5 folds higher than intended for testing; in the course of the assay, this will be diluted to 1x. Caution: The drugs may pose health and/or environmental hazards; thus, they should be handled with proper safety precautions.9.  Prepare the positive control vials (4 replicates each): two sets of 4×4~ml glass vials with 100ul each of 2.5mM and 250uM solutions of CDME (from step A7). In the course of the assay, this will be diluted 5 folds to achieve a final concentration of 500uM and 50uM CDME respectively.10. Prepare the negative control vials (4 replicates each): one set of 4×4~ml glass vials with 100ul each of HPLC water.11. Prepare the drug vials (4 replicates each): one set of 4×4~ml glass vials with 100ul each of 5× drug solution (from step A8). In the course of the assay, this will be diluted to 1x.Notes: a.  For steps A9-A11, at least 3 replicates (ideally 4 replicates) per condition should be used.b.  Borosilicate glass vials as indicated are absolutely required for this step; plastic vials are not compatible with this assay.B.  Preparation of supersaturated solution of cystine1.  Weight out 96 mg of L-cystine (referred to as CC) in a round bottom flask and add 100ml of HPLC-grade water to achieve a final concentration of 4 mM of CC. Notes:a.  Wash round bottom flask thoroughly with HPLC-grade water, ACN, and water again. Avoid the use of soaps/detergent. b.  CC will not dissolve at this stage. c.  100 ml is a suggested volume, adjust based on anticipated number of drugs being tested. Here is an exemplary scenario when 10 drugs are being tested at two concentrations (4 replicates per condition): in this case, one will have 80 drug vials (10 drugs x 2 concentrations x 4 replicates each) and an additional 12 vials for the positive and negative controls to be used in each setup (see steps A9 and A10), i.e., a total of 92 x 4 ml vials. For such a setup, one would need a total of 92 x 400 µl, i.e., 36.8 ml of 4 mM CC solution (vide infra, step C1). Thus preparing 50 ml of solution for reflux (by weighing 48 mg CC) would suffice. 2.  To this add a magnetic stir bar (of suitable size). 3.  Attach the round bottom flask containing the stir bar and CC suspension to a reflux apparatus. Securely attach the flask to the Allihn condenser using clips and turn on the water flow through the condenser jacket. Ensure that a steady (but not vigorous) flow of water is achieved through the condenser. Note: Refluxing refers to the process of heating a solvent (or suspension) to its boiling point and allowing the evaporated solvent to condense back into the original flask, most often using cold water flowing through an Allihn condenser. Refluxing ensures that the solvent (or suspension) is constantly maintained at its boiling point (a fixed temperature), for a prolonged period, without any significant solvent loss due to evaporation. Caution: The reflux apparatus should be set up inside a chemical safety hood. The process requires heating at high temperatures, thus appropriate safety precautions should be taken. 4.  When the water stream through the reflux condenser is steady, turn on the stirring and the heating. It is preferable to stir at a moderate speed (based on individual stirrer settings) and heat at a temperature slightly above the boiling point of water (105-110~^°C) . Monitor the flask closely (every 2-3 min) for water droplets forming at the bottom of the condenser; when the first (approximate) condensed water droplet falls back in the flask, mark the time as the start of refluxing. 5.  Reflux the CC suspension for 20 min, or until all the CC has dissolved to generate a 4 mM supersaturated CC solution. 6.  Turn off the stirring and heating.7.  Remove heating mantle from under the round bottom flask. Caution: Both the mantle and the flask will be extremely hot–use of heat-protective gloves and lab coats are strongly recommended.8.  Let stand for 30-40 min or until the supersaturated CC solution is cooled to almost room temperature, without disturbing the solution.Note: Constant water flow through the reflux condenser is still required throughout the process.C.  Cystine precipitation assay1.  When the supersaturated CC solution from step B8 is cooled to almost room temperature, carefully detach the Allihn condenser from the flask. Using a pipette transfer 400 μl of this solution to each of the control (positive and negative) as well as the drug vials prepared in steps A9-A11. Note: This step should be completed immediately after B8. Also, make sure not to disturb the supersaturated CC solution unnecessarily, i.e., any more than required for the transfer, otherwise CC may crash out.2.  Briefly vortex each vial to homogenize the contents.3.  Incubate vials at 4^°C in an incubator or a fridge for 48-72 h (ideally one that maintains consistent temperatures without much fluctuations).4.  At the end of the incubation period, centrifuge the vials at 1,300xg at 4^°C for 15min .5.  Carefully remove as much of the supernatant from each vial with a 1 ml pipette, without disturbing the crystalline CC precipitate. Next, using gel loading tips and a suitable pipette, remove the remaining supernatant without drawing up any of the precipitated cystine particles. Discard the supernatant. Note: This step requires some practice to effectively remove all supernatant while keeping behind most of the CC particles; we recommend a couple of practice runs with the positive and negative controls before running drug experiments. Caution: The supernatant may contain hazardous drugs/chemicals; thus disposal of the supernatant should be done according to respective institute guidelines.6.  Add 3.6ml of the 30uM d_4 -CC solution (prepared in A6) using a 1 ml pipette to each vial ^4× 900ul transfers to each vial).7.  Vortex well to combine the contents. The precipitated CC may not dissolve at this stage completely.8.  Freeze the solutions at -20~^°C . Notes: a.  Step C8 is necessary to dissolve the precipitated crystals of CC. In our experience, simply leaving the vials at a -20~^°C freezer works best. Attempting to speed up the process by using dry ice or liquid nitrogen results in the glass vial cracking and thus not recommended. b.  The vials can be stored anywhere between a few hours to several months at - -20~^°C .D.  Mass Spectrometry-based quantification of precipitated cystine1.  When ready for analysis, thaw the contents of the precipitation vials (step C8) at room temperature.2.  Once at room temperature, vortex the vials briefly and carefully inspect each vial for remaining CC precipitates. Ideally all vials should have clear solutions at this point.Note: Following the steps as indicated, we have never experienced residual precipitates at this stage. Nonetheless, it is possible that certain drugs may decrease CC solubility such that a lot of CC precipitates during the incubation and not all go back in solution. In such cases, it will be necessary to transfer the vial contents (including any remaining precipitate) to larger tubes, add more  HPLC-grade  water  (the  d4-CC  will  normalize  any  dilution  effects  during  mass spectrometric quantification), and redo steps C8 and D1 for these vials.3.  Transfer 1 ml of the clear solution from each 4ml vials to prelabeled HPLC autosampler vials.4.  Prepare a blank vial with 1 ml HPLC-grade water, as well as an internal standard vial with 1 ml of the 30uM d_4 -CC solution (prepared in A6).5.  Analyze samples using HPLC-MS/MS following vendor-specific instructions. Briefly, this comprises the following steps:a.  Optimize multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for CC and d4-CC. This includes determination of compound-specific precursor and product ions and optimal MS parameters for each transition ( Q_1 , precursor→Q3, product), achieved by isocratic flow injection of the 10uM solution for each compound. Label the most intense (Q_1toQ_3) transition as quantifier and the next best transition as qualifier for each compound (see Table 1).Table 1. LC-MS/MS parameters()Note: DP = Declusturing potential, E P= Entrance potential, CE = Collision energy, and C X P=C o l l i s i o n exit potential.b.  For LC separation, use a solvent gradient of 95% of 20~m M ammonium acetate (p Hg.0-. 9.5) in water and 5% acetonitrile (mobile phase A)–ACN (mobile phase B) at a flow rate of 0.8ml/min , starting with an acetonitrile content of 55% for 0.25~m i n , decreased to 2% at 1.15 min and held at 2% until 1.65 min. Reconstitute the LC column subsequently to its initial condition over the next 0.1 min and re-equilibrate for 0.5 min.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2737","title":"Analyzing the Properties of Murine Intestinal Mucins by Electrophoresis and Histology","text":"Analyzing the Properties of Murine Intestinal Mucins by Electrophoresis and Histology\n\n# Abstract\n\nSpecialized secretory cells known as goblet cells in the intestine and respiratory epithelium are responsible for the secretion of mucins. Mucins are large heavily glycosylated proteins and typically have a molecular mass higher than 10^6 Da. These large proteins are densely substituted with short glycan chains, which have many important functional roles including determining the hydration and viscoelastic properties of the mucus gel that lines and protects the intestinal epithelium. In this protocol, we comprehensively describe the method for extraction of murine mucus and its analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally we describe the use of High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue, Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian Blue and immune–staining methods to identify and differentiate between the different states of glycosylation on these mucin glycoproteins, in particular with a focus on sulphation and sialylation.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Outlines of the procedures describedA.  Biochemical analysis of mucins and mucus1.  Mice are euthanized using cervical dislocation according to approved ethical guidelines by the host institute in a PC2 laboratory.2.  Mice are sprayed with 70% ethanol to avoid the contamination of samples with hair.3.  A mid-line incision is made using scissor in the abdominal cavity.4.  The intestine is pulled out gently using curved tweezers. Intestines are cut at the end attached to the stomach and the rectum end and dissected out. Small intestine, caecum and colon should be kept separately for analysis.5.  Two different types of analyses can be conducted; total mucus present in the murine intestine to assess the overall changes in the mucus barrier or the secreted mucus which covers and protects the intestinal epithelium.# For secreted mucus extraction from mouse intestinea.  Place the intestine in a 10 cm Petri dish. Gently flush the intestines with PBS, to remove fecal matter, using a syringe with a 19.5 gauge needle through one open end. The amount of PBS will vary depending on the mouse strain and/or the part of intestine that are used. Usually up to 5~ml is used for colon, 7 ml for the small intestine and approximately 3-4 ml for the caecum. This material is discarded unless required for microbiota analyses.b.  Place the intestine in a new Petri dish and flush the intestine slowly 5 times with 3 M urea (2 ml each flush) to obtain the secreted mucus from the lumen of the intestine. 3 M urea is recommended, as higher concentrations of urea or the use of GuCl would result in disrupting the intestinal epithelial cell layer. The material isolated is viscous; therefore use a plastic transfer pipette to transfer the material to a 15ml Falcon tube on ice.c. Intestinal tissue is processed for histology (as described in Procedure B–histochemical analysis of mucin glycoproteins) before (a small section from the intestine) and after flushing (the whole intestine is rolled) with urea to ensure that only the secreted mucus was isolated and the intestinal crypts remained intact.# For total mucus extraction from mouse intestinea.  Place the intestine in a 10 cm Petri dish. Gently flush intestine with PBS, to remove fecal matter, using a syringe with a 19.5 gauge needle through one open end. It is important to ensure that the intestine is only gently flushed; otherwise the secreted mucus layer will be lost. The amount of PBS will vary depending on the strain of mice and/or the part of intestine that are used. Usually up to 5ml is used for colon, 7 ml for the small intestine and approximately 3-4 ml for the caecum. This material is discarded as it consists of insoluble fecal matter and negligible amounts of secreted mucus (as has been previously investigated by the authors, the faecal mucin matter is not detected via Western blotting).b.  Cut intestine open longitudinally using a spring scissor. Once open, scrape off the residual mucus, using a cell scraper. This will remove the mucins present in the goblet cells as well as the secreted mucus layer and represents the total intestinal mucus.c.  The mucus is transferred to a 15~ml Falcon tube and solubilized in 6 M GuCl reduction buffer (see Recipes) at 4^°C overnight by rotation using a Beckman Coulter 15~ml rotator. GuCl is a strong chaotrope and denatures proteins and is recommended for the solubilisation of total mucus isolated from animals. Once solubilized, store sample at - 80^°C until required later.# bio-protocol6.  Separation of mucins by agarose gel electrophoresisa.  The total mucus and or secreted mucus can now be analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis.b.  Before gel electrophoresis, reduce mucus samples with 50 mM DTT for 2 h at 37~^°C to break up the disulphide bonds.c.  After reduction, add 0.125 M iodoacetamide to the mucus sample and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to carboxymethylate mucus, to prevent reformation of the disulphide bonds.d.  Up to 3 ml of the isolated samples in GuCl can then be dialyzed in 3-6 M urea using D-TubeTM dialyzers (Mw cut-off of 14k D a or below is sufficient). Dialysis to urea is essential as GuCl has a very high salt content.e. 10% (v/v) loading buffer (see Recipes) is added in samples before electrophoresis.f. Samples are electrophoresed on 0.7-1% (w/v) agarose gels (around 5–7 m m in thickness) in TAE buffer (see Recipes) with 0.1% SDS at 30 for 15h (Thornton et al., 2000) (Figure 1).g.  After electrophoresis, transfer mucins onto a nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum blotting in 4x SSC running buffer (see Recipes) at a pressure of 45-50 mbar using a 785 Bio-Rad Vacuum Blotter (Sheehan and Thornton, 2000) for around 1.5-3 h (Figure 2). To ensure a tight seal, 0.7% agarose can be used to seal the sides of the gel during the vacuum blotting process. Once the entire loading dye has disappeared from the gel, the vacuum blotting process is stopped and the gel is disposed. Note, vacuum blotting consistently results in efficient mucin protein transfer and is the recommended method. The nitrocellulose membrane is carefully removed using tweezers and can be analysed by using three distinct methods (as described in steps A7-A9).To determine the changes in the glycosylation of mucins, two separate methods can be utilized which are described in detail below. Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian blue staining can differentiate between acidic and neutral mucins, whereas High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue staining can be used to identify the changes in mucin sulphation and sialylation.7.  Glycoprotein detection using PAS staininga.  Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely.b.  Wash nitrocellulose membrane with d H_2O .c.  Incubate nitrocellulose membrane with periodic acid solution (see Recipes) at room temperature for 30 min. Periodic acid will oxidise the vicinal diols in mucin glycoproteins.d.  Wash membrane thoroughly with d H_2O to remove the periodic acid solution.e.  Nitrocellulose membrane is incubated with sodium metabisulphite solution (see Recipes) for 5 min, the solution is discarded and this step is repeated once more. This step is essential to reduce background staining.f.  Add Schiff’s reagent to the membrane and incubate for approximately 10-15 min at room temperature. The vicinal diols in mucin glycoproteins exposed by periodic acid will react with the Schiff’s reagent to give a purple-magenta colour.g.  Rinse membrane with sodium metabisulphite solution, followed by a wash with dH2O to stop the reaction.h.  Air-dry nitrocellulose membrane before taking scanning using Odyssey® CLx Imager and densitometry analyses (Thornton et al., 1994) (Figure 4).()Figure 4. Scanned nitrocellulose membrane stained with PAS and anti-Muc2 antibody. Total mucus from the colon was extracted from 4 individual C57BL/6 mice and analysed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Nitrocellulose membrane was stained with PAS (A) or anti-Muc2 antibody (B, H300, from Santa Cruz) and developed using infrared-labelled secondary antibody. Membrane was scanned using the Odyssey® CLx Imager.Note: Each individual animal colon yields sufficient mucus for gel electrophoresis analyses– indicates empty lane as negative control.8.  Detection of sulphated glycoprotein using High Iron Diamine (HID)a.  Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely.b.  Wash nitrocellulose membrane with dH2O.c.  Incubate nitrocellulose membranes with HID solution (see Recipes) for 18 h at room temperature.d.  Wash membrane in dH2O and air-dry before scanning using Odyssey® CLx Imager (Hasnain et al., 2017).9.  Immunodetection of mucin proteinsa.  Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely. b.  Wash nitrocellulose membrane briefly in TBST buffer (see Recipes).c.  Block membrane with milk blocking buffer (see Recipes) or Odyssey blocking buffer for at least 30 min at room temperature (alternatively membrane can be kept in blocking buffer at 4^°C overnight).d.  Wash membrane 2 times with 15 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer.e.  Incubate with anti-Muc2 antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) overnight at 4^°C .f.  Wash membrane 2 times with 5 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer.g.  Incubate with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature.h.  For  horseradish  peroxidase  (HRP)-conjugated  secondary  antibodies,  peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane is then washed 3 times with 5 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer. Incubate membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence western detection reagent for approximately 2 min and then washed to remove excess and subsequently expose nitrocellulose membrane to BIOMAXTM BML film in the dark and develop.i.  For the phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody, phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 times washes in TBST buffer, membrane is then incubated with nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3yl phosphate substrate for 5 min to develop.j.  For infrared fluorescent dyes labelled antibodies, IRDye® 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 2,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 times washes in TBST buffer, nitrocellulose membranes can be directly scanned at 700 or 800 nm using Odyssey® CLx Imager (Figure 4B).B.  Histochemical analysis of mucin glycoproteinsSwiss Roll’ techniquea.  Dissect the intestine as described in steps A1-A4 (Figure 5A). Intestine is then cut open longitudinally (Figure 5B) using spring scissors and fecal matter is gently removed by using a P200 pipette tip (Figure 5C). Roll the intestine around a 16 gauge needle with the help of tweezers starting from the rectum end (Figures 5D and 5E). The roll is then pinned onto a small piece of polystyrene using 30 gauge needles (Figure 5F) and placed in fixative solution 4% PFA or 10% neutrally buffered formalin Figure 5G) for ^24h (Reilly and Kirsner, 1965).# 2.  Tissue processinga.  Swiss rolls are transferred to embedding cassettes (Figure 5H) and placed in 70% ethanol.b.  Process specimens using the Micro Spin Tissue processor (STP) 120. Specimens then go through series of solvents (1 change of 70% , 90% , 95% ethanol, 3 changes of 100% ethanol, 3 changes of xylene and 3 changes of paraffin) for a total of 8 h before beingembedded in wax.c.  Paraffin cell blocks (Figure 5I) can be stored at room temperature until cut to a thickness of 4um sample using Micron Cool Cut HM355S microtome with microtome blade MX35.d.  Sections are floated in a warm water bath (37.4 ^°C) before being positioned on microscope slides, dried at 37^°C overnight and stored at room temperature until use.()Figure 5. Mouse intestine dissection and ‘Swiss Roll’ technique for histology. Mouse intestine is dissected (A) followed by opening longitudinally using spring scissor (B) and removing feces using a P200 tip (C). Intestine is rolled around a 16 gauge needle with the help of tweezers (D, E). Swiss roll is secured on polystyrene cube with two needles pin in opposite direction (make sure needle is not placed in tissue) (F) before putting into specimen jar with 10% buffer formalin for fixation ( G) . Fixed Swiss roll is transferred into histology cassette (H) for paraffin embedding (I).3.  Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian Blue (PAS-AB) staining a.  Before staining, slides are rehydrated by going through xylene and ethanol gradient for 5 min in each solution (2 changes of xylene, 2 changes of 100% ethanol, 1 change of 95% and 70% ethanol). Rehydrated slides are placed in PBS for further staining.b.  Place slides in AB solution for 5 min and then wash briefly in ddH2O. AB stains sulphated and sialylated glycoproteins.c.  For staining of neutral glycoproteins, incubate the slides with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide in d H_2O for 30 min at room temperature.d.  Place slides in 1% periodic acid solution (see Recipes) for 5 min followed by a thorough wash in ddH2O to remove the acidic solution.e.  The slides are then placed in Schiff’s reagent for 10 min and washed again in ddH2O.f.  All slides are washed under running d H_2O for 10m i n and counterstained with haematoxylin for 30 sec.g.  Slides are washed in hot ddH2O (warm ddH2O at high power, 30 sec in microwave) for 15 to 30 sec.h.  Slides are placed in ethanol gradients (from 70% to 100% ) and xylene for dehydration, mounted using Pertex mounting medium and sealed with cover slips (Figure 6).()Figure 6. Pictures of PAS-AB stain in small intestine, proximal colon and distal colon of C57BL/6 mice. Neutral glycoproteins are stained in magenta (red arrow, depicting the glycocalyx), mucins that are both acidic and neutrally charged are stained in purple (blue plus magenta stain, green arrow) and acidic glycoproteins are stained in blue (black arrow). These slides were counterstained with haematoxylin (as described in step B3f). Scale bars =200~um (low power), 100um (high power).4.  High Iron Diamine-Alcian blue (HID-AB) staininga.  Prepare HID solution freshly every time within 4-6 h of use (as described in Recipes).b.  After the slides are passed through the xylene and ethanol gradient as described in step B3a, slides are incubated with HID for 18h at room temperature. HID will stain sulphated mucins in black.c.  Wash slides with ddH2O thoroughly to remove the HID staining solution.d.  Place slides in AB solution for 30 min (Figure 7) (Spicer, 1965), which will stain sialylated mucins.e.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2767","title":"Tumorigenicity Assay in Nude Mice","text":"Tumorigenicity Assay in Nude Mice\n\n# Abstract\n\nTumorigenicity  refers  to  the  ability  of  cultured  cells  to  develop  viable  tumors  in immune-deficient  animals.  The  goal  of  this  protocol  is  to  illustrate  tumorigenicity  assay  by subcutaneous tumor-cell-transplantation in nude mice. Target cells are transplanted to 6-week-old nude mice subcutaneously and the tumor growth is monitored over a period of observation or treatment. When tumor grows to a pre-determined size or by the end of the limited period, the nude mice will be euthanatized and the xenograft will be removed for further examination.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  0.1-20 ml pipette tips (Eppendorf, catalog number: 22492012)\n2. 5-200 ml pipette tips (Eppendorf, catalog number: 22492039)\n3. 50-1,000 ml pipette tips (Eppendorf, catalog number: 22492055)\n4.

Trypsinize cells at 80-90% confluence (in exponential growth phase) and harvest cells with complete medium to a sterile centrifuge tube. Note: Cells should be harvested in the exponential growth stage, which can greatly affect the viability of cell line transplantation. If the tumor viability is poor with a cell line xenograft, Matrigel can be used as injection mixture to provide an enriched stromal environment for engraftment.3.  Pellet cells at 60~x~g for 5 min, remove supernatant and resuspend cells homogeneously in PBS. Note: Cells should be resuspended into monoplast suspension for cell counting.4.  Measure and adjust cell concentration to 1-5×10^7/ml Note: Ensure that cells suspension is mixed uniformly for accurate cell counting.5.  Transfer 5×10^6 cells and spin at 60 xg for 5 min for cell collection.6.  Resuspend the pelleted cells in 0.2ml PBS and move them into a sterile Eppendorf tube (1.5 ml) for injection.B.  Subcutaneous injection of cells1.  Fill injector (1 m) with an appropriate volume of cell suspension (0.2m l) , avoiding any bubbles to enter the syringe.2.  Restrain the animal in an upright position by grasping the skin over the shoulders with the thumb and index finger, keeping the fore legs from pushing the syringe away (Figure 1).3.  Disinfect the dorsal skin gently with 70% -ethanol-saturated cotton balls for 2-3 times (Figure 1).()Figure 1. Disinfection of the nude mice dorsal skin. The nude mice were restrained by grasping the skin over the shoulders with left thumb and index finger. Disinfect the dorsal skin gently with 70% -ethanol-saturated cotton balls around the injection site for 2-3 times.4.  Gently insert the needle into the skin on the dorsal flank to reach the subcutaneous pocket (avoid the underlying muscle layer) (Figure 2A).5.  Gently expel the contents of the syringe. (Figure 2B). Note: If you inject accurately into the subcutaneous pocket, there will be no resistance to expel the contents of the syringe.()Figure 2. Subcutaneous injection of cell suspension into the nude mice. A. Inserting the needle into the skin on the dorsal flank to reach the subcutaneous pocket but not the underlying muscle layer; B. Expelling the contents of the syringe for the subcutaneous implant.6.  Withdraw the needle and place mice back into the cage. Note: After injection, stay for a few seconds before pulling out the needle in case of leakage of cell suspension.7.  Monitor survival of nude mice and tumor growth 2-3 times a week, measuring the maximum (L) and minimum (W) length of the tumor using a slide caliper.8.  Tumor volume can be calculated by the volume formula (Tomayko and Reynolds, 1989):V_top=1/2(L×W×W)where, L: the maximum length of the tumor; W: the minimum length of the tumor.9.  When tumor grows to a diameter of 150-200 m m^3 , remove the xenograft from sacrificed nude mice, weight and measure tumor size for tumor volume.10. Preserve the xenograft appropriately for histological or biochemical investigation if it is required.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparing Cells for Transplantation\nMaintain cells in complete medium at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nTrypsinize cells at 80-90% confluence and harvest cells with complete medium to a sterile centrifuge tube.\n## Cell Harvesting and Preparation\nPellet cells at 60xg for 5 min, remove supernatant and resuspend cells homogeneously in PBS.\nMeasure and adjust cell concentration to 1-5×10^7/ml.\nTransfer 5×10^6 cells and spin at 60xg for 5 min for cell collection.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in 0.2ml PBS and move them into a sterile Eppendorf tube (1.5 ml) for injection.\n## Subcutaneous Injection of Cells\nFill injector (1 ml) with an appropriate volume of cell suspension (0.2 ml), avoiding any bubbles to enter the syringe.\n## Animal Preparation\nRestrain the animal in an upright position by grasping the skin over the shoulders with the thumb and index finger.\nDisinfect the dorsal skin gently with 70%-ethanol-saturated cotton balls for 2-3 times.\n## Injection Procedure\nGently insert the needle into the skin on the dorsal flank to reach the subcutaneous pocket.\nGently expel the contents of the syringe.\n## Post-Injection Care\nWithdraw the needle and place mice back into the cage.\nMonitor survival of nude mice and tumor growth 2-3 times a week.\n## Tumor Measurement and Calculation\nMeasure the maximum (L) and minimum (W) length of the tumor using a slide caliper.\nCalculate tumor volume using the formula: V_top=1/2(L×W×W).\n## Xenograft Removal and Preservation\nRemove the xenograft from sacrificed nude mice when tumor grows to a diameter of 150-200 mm^3.\nWeight and measure tumor size for tumor volume.\nPreserve the xenograft appropriately for histological or biochemical investigation if required.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Model Organism-Specific Techniques"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2852","title":"Muscle Histology Characterization Using H&E Staining and Muscle Fiber Type Classification Using Immunofluorescence Staining","text":"Muscle Histology Characterization Using H&E Staining and Muscle Fiber Type Classification Using Immunofluorescence Staining\n\n# Abstract\n\nMuscle function is determined by its structure and fiber type composition. Here we describe a protocol to examine muscle histology and myofiber types using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. H&E stain nucleus in blue and cytoplasm in red, therefore allowing for morphological analyses, such as myofiber diameter, the presence of degenerated and regenerated myofibers, and adipocytes and fibrotic cells. Muscle fibers in adult skeletal muscles of rodents are classified into 4 subtypes based on the expression of myosin heavy chain proteins: Myh7 (type I fiber), Myh2 (type IIA fiber), Myh1 (type IIX fiber), Myh4 (type IIB fiber). A panel of monoclonal antibodies can be used to specifically label these muscle fiber subtypes. These protocols are commonly used in the study of muscle development, growth and regeneration (for example: Wang et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Incubate for 16h at 39^°C in a C O_2 incubator with 5% CO2.# B.  Day 21.  Add colcemid to 0.1 u/ m l final concentration to the 5~ml cell culture in each of the flasks and incubate for 150min in the C O_2 incubator.2.  Harvest the culture with 5~ml of colcemid-treated cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 201 xg in 15ml tubes.3.  Discard the supernatants and gently vortex the cell pellet to resuspend it in the remaining liquid.4.  Vortex the tube at very low intensity and add drop by drop 1 ml ice cold hypotonic buffer.5.  Add drop by drop another 1 ml ice cold hypotonic buffer (no need to vortex).6.  Incubate for 15 min on ice.7.  Meanwhile label cytospin slides and carefully place them in the cytofunnel according to manufacturers’ protocol. See Figure 1 for image of the cytofunnel.()Figure 1. Image showing the cytofunnel. Top arrow indicates the site of loading into the funnel. Bottom arrow indicates the flow direction of the cell suspension toward the slide, which is indicated as a blue line. This takes place during centrifugation with the result that cells are spun onto the slide at the site of the red X.8.  After the 15 min incubation, transfer 400~ul of the cell suspension from step B5 to the cytofunnel and spin it in a cytospin centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm corresponding to 113xg .9.  Take the slide out of the cytofunnel.10. To fix the sample on the slide, carefully add 100~ul paraformaldehyde solution to the marked area on the slide and leave for 10m i n in the fume hood (the paraformaldehyde should stay as a droplet on the slide).11. Immerse slides in a Coplin jar with 35ml KCM buffer for 10 min.12. Pour out the KCM buffer (hold the slides in place) and then add 35ml of PBS to the Coplin jar with the slides.13. Pour out the PBS (hold the slides in place) and then add 35ml of PBS to the Coplin jar with the slides once again. Note: At this stage you may store the Coplin jar with slides in PBS in the fridge until next day.14. After at least 5 min, take out the slides and drain them well. Note: Slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle.15. Add 30ul blocking solution to the area within the circle and cover with coverslip.16. Leave for 30 min at room temperature and then very carefully remove the coverslip. (Most of the blocking solution is removed along with the coverslip.)17. Add 20~ul primary anti-GFP antibody solution to the area within the circle, and cover with a coverslip.18. Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37^°C for 25m i n .19. Remove the coverslip carefully and wash 2 times, for 3 min each time in PBS-T in a Coplin jar.20. Drain (slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle) and add 20~ul Alexa-488 secondary antibody working solution to the area within the circle. Then cover the area within the circle with a coverslip.21. Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37^°C for 30m i n (protected from light).22. Remove coverslip carefully and wash 2 times for 3 min each time in PBS-T (35m l) ) in a Coplin jar.23. Drain (slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle) and mount round coverslip onto glass slide with 6ul DAPI-mounting buffer.24. Seal with a thin layer of nail polish at the edge of the coverslip. See Figure 2 for image of the slide.()Figure 2. Image of the cytospin slide. The sample is within the white circle. A round coverslip covers the area within the circle and nail polish is used to seal the coverslip along the edges/the white circle.25. When the nail polish is dry, store the slides in a slide storage box in the fridge or proceed directly to microscopic analyses of the slides.# Notes:a.  Fluorophores may be visualized under a wide-field microscope (DeltaVision Elite; Applied Precision) equipped with a 100x objective lens (U-PLAN S-APO, NA 1.4; Olympus), a cooled EM CCD camera (Evolve 512; Photometrics), and a solid-state illumination source (Insight; Applied Precision) or similar fluorescence microscope.b.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2873","title":"Mating Based Split-ubiquitin Assay for Detection of Protein Interactions","text":"Mating Based Split-ubiquitin Assay for Detection of Protein Interactions\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe mating based split-ubiquitin (mbSUS) assay is an alternative method to the classical yeast two-hybrid system with a number of advantages. The mbSUS assay relies on the ubiquitindegradation pathway as a sensor for protein-protein interactions, and it is suitable for the determination of interactions between full-length proteins that are cytosolic or membrane-bound. Here we describe the mbSUS assay protocol which has been used for detecting the interaction between K^+ channel and SNARE proteins (Grefen et al., 2010 and 2015; Zhang et al., 2015 and 2016)\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Molecular biologyGateway® Technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) is used to create plasmids for the yeast mbSUS assay following the manufacturer’s instructions. The unique attB1 and attB2 sites (B1 5’-3’: ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggct; B2 5’-3’: ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggt) are included in the forward and reverse primers as overhanging sequences, respectively. To fuse the PCR product in the proper reading frame with an N-terminal tag, the forward primer must include two additional nucleotides. Depending on the destination vector, a stop codon is included in the reverse primer or provided on the vector itself.Subsequent PCR products are inserted by BP reactions into the pDONR207 vector to yield Entry clones that are verified by DNA sequencing. Gateway Destination clones, pNX35-Dest for prey (Grefen and Blatt, 2012) and pMetYC-Dest for bait (Grefen et al., 2009), are generated by using LR Clonase® II in LR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.# B.  Yeast transformationThe yeast transformation is performed under sterile condition. Prepare fresh competent yeast for each transformation.1.  Pick THY.AP4 and AP5 yeast from long-term stock by a sterile toothpick or pick one colony of yeast from a stock plate (see Note 7) and inoculate 5ml YPD in 14ml sterile round bottom tubes and incubate in a shaker overnight at 200 rpm, 28^°C .2.  Inoculate 45ml of YPD with the 5~ml of overnight culture in autoclaved 500ml flasks and incubate with shaking at 200 rpm, 28~^°C for 3-5h until O D_600 0.6-0.83.  Harvest cells by centrifugation (10 min at 2,000× g,4^°C) in 50~ml blue screw cap tubes and discard the supernatant.4.  Wash cells with ^20l ml of sterile water, centrifuge again, and discard the supernatant.5.  Resuspend the cells with 1.8ml of 0.1 M LiAc and transfer to a _2ml Eppendorf tube, spin down (30 sec at 2,000× g,4^°C) , and discard the supernatant.6.  Add an appropriate amount of 0.1 M LiAc (multiply the number of transformations by 20ul ) and incubate at room temperature for 30m i n .7.  Meanwhile, prepare sterilized PCR tubes with 10~ul of ssDNA and 5~ul of plasmid DNA (Destination clones, >100n g/ul) for each transformation.8.  Prepare a master mix: mix 70~ul of PEG solution, 10~ul of 1 M LiAc, and 20~ul of competent yeast (from step B6) for each transformation.9.  Mix the master mix with the DNA mixture from step B7.10. In a PCR machine, incubate at 30^°C for 30 min, then gently mix the mixture by pipette and heat shock cells at 43^°C for 30m i n .11. Spin down the yeast at 2,000× g for 1 min, and discard the supernatant by pipetting it carefully off the pelleted cells.12. Wash the cells with 100ul of sterile water, spin down, and discard the supernatant.13. Resuspend cells in 50ul of sterile water and plate on the appropriate selective media. a.  THY.AP4 carrying bait vector plates on CSM-LM solid medium. b.  THY.AP5 carrying prey vector plates on CSM-TUM solid medium.14. Incubate for 48-72h at 28^°C . At least 100 colonies are expected in each plate.# C. mbSUS assayThe mbSUS assay is performed under sterile conditions.1.  Pick 5-15 colonies of transformed THY.AP5 yeast carrying the prey construct and inoculate in 3 ml CSM-TUM media. Grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28^°C .2.  Pick 5-15 colonies of transformed THY.AP4 yeast carrying the bait construct and inoculate in 3 ml CSM-LM media. Grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28~^°C .3.  Reserve 750~ul from each bait and prey yeast culture to store as a stock culture (see Note for yeast stock preparation).4.  Harvest yeast cells by centrifugation at 2,000× g for 1 min at room temperature and resuspend the pellets in YPD media (for each mating 20ul of YPD media should be calculated).5.  Mix 20~ul of each yeast (carrying bait) and yeast (carrying prey) in sterilized PCR tube and immediately drop 4ul of each mated yeast onto YPD plate. Incubate overnight at 28~^°C .6.  Transfer the mated yeast from the YPD plate to a CSM-LTUM plate with a sterile toothpick (Figure 2A). Grow overnight at 28~^°C .()Figure 2. Example of a mbSUS assay. A. Yeast is transferred from the YPD plate to a CSMLTUM plate with a sterile toothpick. B. Yeast is dropped on the CSM-LTUMAH plate with black spots on paper. C. Diploid yeast expressing KAT1-CubPLV as bait with NubG-X fusions of VAMP721, VAMP723, and the controls (negative: NubG; positive: NubWt) as prey were spotted onto different media as indicated. CSM-LTUM was used to verify the presence of both bait and prey vectors. The addition of different concentration of methionine (Met) to CSM-LTUMAH was used to verify interaction when K^+ channel-CubPLV expression was suppressed. Diploid yeast was dropped at 1.0 and 0.1 O D_600 in each case. Incubation time was 24 h for CSM-LTUM plate and 72 h for CSM-LTUMAH plates. Western blot analysis of the diploid yeast used in mbSUS was carried out with commercial HA antibody for the VAMP fusions and VP16 antibody for the K^+ channel fusions. Ponceau S stains were used as blotting/loading control (right).7.  Pick the mated yeast colony of each sample from the CSM-LTUM plate and inoculate in 3ml liquid CSM-LTUM media, grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28~^°C .8.  Inoculate 1~ml of the mated cells into 3ml of fresh CSM-LTUM media and grow at 200 rpm, 28^°C for 4-6h for later Western blot analysis.9.  Determine O D_600 of yeast cells from step C7.10. Harvest 100~ul of remaining cells from step C7 by centrifugation at 2,000 x g 1 min at room temperature and dilute them to O D_600 1.0 and 0.1 respectively in sterile water.11. Apply 4ul drops of each dilution on CSM-LTUM and CSM-LTUMAH plates with different methionine concentrations (0.5, 5, 50, and 500uM ; Figure 2B), grow them at 28^°C . Check for growth after 1 day and 3 days growth on CSM-LTUM plate and CSM-LTUMAH plate respectively. Figure 2C shows an example of a mbSUS assay which indicates an interaction between VAMP721 and KAT1 K^+ channel, and no interaction between VAMP723 and KAT1 (Zhang et al., 2015). Diploid yeastcontaining NubWt as prey serves as the positive control and yeast containing NubG as prey is the negative control. In a good mbSUS assay, the sample of negative control should show weak or no yeast growth on CSM-LTUMAH plates, while the yeast grows well in the positive control sample (Figure 2C).D.  Yeast protein extraction for western blot analysis1.  Determine the O D_600 of the yeast culture.2.  Harvest _2m l of the culture and resuspend in ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer at a final OD600 of 100 for each sample. The volume of ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer used is calculated like this: e.g., the 1:10 diluted culture measurement yields an OD600 of 0.5, which is equivalent to an OD600 of 5 for 1 ml of culture. Harvest _2m l of the culture yields OD600 of 10. Then resuspend them in 0.1 ml of ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer can get a final O D_600 of 100 in the sample.3.  Lyse the yeast with an ultrasonic disintegrator (amplitude setting 10 for 20 sec, keep samples on ice).4.  Incubate for 10 min at 65^°C .5.  Vortex for 10 sec, spin down the lysate at full speed for 30 sec and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Then sample can be used for Western blot analysis.E.  Western blot analysis1.

When using proteins fusions, the C-terminus of the native protein with the Y-CubPLV fusion should be located in the cytosol and the NubG-X fusion of the prey should also be available in the cytosol for effective interactions to take place. Reassembly of Cub and Nub then leads to cleavage of the PLV moiety and allows this transcription factor to move into the nucleus.2.  Macromolecules smaller than 40 kDa can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore, and some larger particles are also able to pass through the large diameter of the pore (Marfori et al., 2011). So the bait protein should normally be anchored to a membrane. Soluble bait fusions could otherwise move into the nuclear and activate the reporter genes independent of any interaction and PLV cleavage. Preys fusions need not be membrane anchored.3.  Expression of fusion proteins in the bait vector pMetYC-Dest is under control of the met25 promoter which suppresses expression in the presence of methionine in the culture media (Grefen et al., 2009). However, our experience of mbSUS assay shows that the yeast growth on media without external methionine is slower than the yeast on media adding 5uM methionine. To overcome this problem, it is recommended to add 0.5~uM methionine to the media. Higher concentrations, up to 1 mM Met, are used to test for specificity in interaction by reducing the bait expression.4.  Before yeast dropping, it is recommended to allow media plates to dry. Allow the surface of the plate to dry for 30 min under sterile conditions. The dry surface of the solid media in plate helps to keep the yeast-spot round.5.  When dropping yeast, it is recommended to print a dropping scheme with black spots on paper and stick it under the plate, as shown in Figure 2B left.6.  For Western blot analysis, we recommend that the yeast is not cultured overnight. Add 3 ml fresh media to a 1~ml yeast culture from the previous overnight growth and allow the culture to grow for a further 4-6 h before harvesting. This approach avoids the possibility of senescent yeast in the culture which may introduce degraded protein and lead to poor Western blot results.7.  To prepare yeast stock for long-term storage, pipette 750~ul of fresh overnight yeast culture (from step C1 or C2) and add 250~ul of sterile 60% glycerol to a 1.5ml screw cap tube, tightly close the cap and mix before freezing at -80~^°C . It is recommended to refresh glycerol stocks every 6 months and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the glycerol stock. To recover yeast cells from a glycerol stock, pick frozen yeast cells using a sterile toothpick, drop and spread onto the appropriate selective media solid plate, then incubate at 28~^°C for 24-48 h . Yeast colonies on selective media are ready to use for mbSUS assay, and the yeast colonies can be stored at 4^°C for up to 1 month. To prepare a yeast stock for short-term storage, pipette 5-10 ul of fresh overnight yeast culture (from step C1 or C2) or pick frozen yeast cells from glycerol stock; and drop cells on appropriate selective solid media. Culture yeast for 24-48~h~ at 28~^°C , then store at 4^°C for up to1 month.# Recipes1.

PCC 6803\n\n# Abstract\n\nIsolation of ribosomal particles is an essential step in the study of ribosomal components as well as in the analysis of trans-acting factors that interact with the ribosome to regulate protein synthesis and modulate the expression profile of the cell in response to different environmental conditions. In this protocol, we describe a procedure for the isolation of 70S ribosomes from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis). We have successfully used this protocol in our study of the cyanobacterial ribosomal-associated protein LrtA, which is a homologue of bacterial HPF (hibernation promoting factor) (Galmozzi et al., 2016).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Scheme of the complete procedure described in the protocol# A.  Cultivation of Synechocystis1.  Grow Synechocystis cells photoautotrophically at 30~^°C in BG11 medium (Rippka et al., 1979) supplemented with 1L^-1 of N a H C O_3 (BG11C) under continuous illumination 50~mu m0^1 of photons m^-2s e c^-1 , white light from fluorescent lamps).a.  Usually cultivation begins with a pre-inoculum (50m) growing in Erlenmeyer flasks covered with cotton and placed on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) located in an illuminated room.b.  These cells are then used to inoculate around 750~m l of BG11C medium in a Roux flask. Finally the culture is scaled to a 5 L bottle (without the cap and covered with cotton). Note: tau_O achieve optimal growth, the cultures in Roux flasks and in 5 L bottles are bubbled with C O_2 -enriched air (1%nu/v) , using a rigid polypropylene tube, silicone tubing and metal connectors. A compressed air stream drives bubbling and the air- .C O_2 mixture is established using flow meters.2.  Estimation of growth phaseA volume of 3-5 L of cells, in exponential or stationary growth phase depending on the purpose of each experiment, is used. Growth phase is estimated by measuring total chlorophyll content in methanolic extracts of cells (McKinney, 1941).a.  Centrifuge 1 ml of culture in a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube at 12,000× g.b.  Discard 950ul of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remaining 50ul . Add 950 ul of methanol and vortex vigorously for 1 min.c.  Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min. Chlorophyll concentration is calculated by measuring absorbance at 665n m in the supernatant ( E=74.46n g^-1m lc m^-1) .d.  Cultures with 2-4u/ml of total chlorophyll are considered to be in exponential phase and cultures with more than 5ug/ml are considered stationary.# 3.  Harvest cellsa.  Centrifuge at 9,605× g in a JLA-16.250 Beckman rotor, for 10min at 4^°C . b.  Combine the cells in a single bottle and estimate fresh weight. 2-5 of cells are enough for the procedure.B.  Breakage and fractionation of Synechocystis cellsPre-treatmentAll glass materials, porcelain mortar and pestle were heated in a sterilization oven at 200^°C for 3h and all plastic materials were autoclaved at 121~^°C for 20m i n .Note: RNase-free water was used to prepare all buffers.2.  Breakage of Synechocystis cellsPlace in a pre-chilled porcelain mortar the same weight of cells and alumina. Put the mortar on top of an ice bucket with ice. Mix with the pestle and once the cells and the alumina are well mixed continue grinding for 2 min. Add around 20 ml extraction buffer (1 or 10 mM Mg-acetate) with  -mercaptoethanol added immediately before use.3.  Fractionation of Synechocystis cellsRecover as much material as possible in two polypropylene tubes of 15ml . Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min in a JA-25.15 rotor at 4~^°C to eliminate the alumina, the cell debris and the unbroken cells. Transfer the supernatant into new 15ml tubes and centrifuge at 30,000~x~g for 30 min in the same rotor at 4~^°C . This centrifugation is required to completely eliminate membranes.# 4.  Freezing reserveDispense aliquots from the supernatant of this centrifugation step (S30 fraction) in 1.5~ml Eppendorf tubes with 5% (v/v) glycerol. For this process, place the 1.5ml tubes on ice and add 40~ul of 80% (v/v) glycerol and 600~ul of the S30 fraction to each tube. Mix gently, using a micropipette, and rapidly freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen. Before freezing reserve an aliquot to determine the total protein amount of this S30 fraction by the standard method of Bradford, using albumin bovine as reference (Bradford et al., 1976). Usually 10-15~u/ul of total protein concentration is obtained in S30 fraction.# Notes:a.  When extraction buffer and gradient solutions contain 1 mM Mg-acetate (low M g^2+, , most bacterial ribosomes are dissociated into 30S and 50S subunits but when using 10 mM Mgacetate (high M g^2+, ), in the buffers and solutions, the 70S vacant ribosome peak is mainly observed.b.  It is worth noting that in cyanobacteria, phycobiliproteins represent around 30% of total protein concentration. This fact must be taken into account when considering the amount of the S30 fraction needed for the next step of this procedure.c.  The S30 fraction can be stored as different aliquots at - -80~^°C to load separate gradients on different days. This is a backup in case there is any problem in later steps of the protocol, especially in the centrifugation, fractionation or generation of the gradient profiles.C.  Preparation of sucrose gradients and ultracentrifugationPreparation of sucrose gradientsa.  Prepare a 10-30% sucrose gradient using a linear gradient maker connected to a peristaltic pump (P1) working at 120~ml/h . Use sucrose buffer 1 and 2 solutions (either with 1 or 10 mM Mg-acetate), with  -mercaptoethanol added immediately before use, and 13.2~ml ultracentrifuge thin-wall polyallomer tubes. Place the gradient maker on top of a magnetic stirrer plate.b.  Introduce a small magnetic stir bar in the gradient maker compartment connected to the pump. Pour 5.6ml of sucrose buffer 1 in this compartment and 5.6ml of sucrose buffer 2 in the other compartment of the gradient maker. The outlet of the peristaltic pump is connected to a glass capillary that is introduced into the gradient tube.c.  Connect the two compartments of the gradient maker and simultaneously turn on pump P1.d.  Stop the pump when the solutions introduced in the gradient maker are exhausted, before air bubbles enter the gradient.e.  Then remove the capillary from the gradient tube slowly so as not to disturb it.f.  Tubes are stored at 4^°C for about 8 h before use to allow equilibration of the linear sucrose gradients.g.  Before loading, filter the S30 fraction through a 0.45um filter unit.Ultracentrifugationa.  Gently layer the S30 fraction (100-300~uI) on top of the 10–30% sucrose gradient using a micropipette and via single drops close to the surface of the sucrose gradient.b.  Centrifuge at 77,175xg, for ^8h at ^2°C in a pre-cooled Beckman ultracentrifuge in the SW 41 Ti rotor.D.  Isolation of ribosomal particles1.  Carefully remove the gradient tubes from the centrifuge and completely fill each tube with MilliQ water before placing it in the ISCO fractionation system.2.  Fractionate the gradient from the top using 60% (W/v) sucrose to push the content of the tube toward the UV detector (A_254) , with the TRISTM pump (flow rate 1 m/m i n) ). Turn on the recorder (1 cm/min, sensitivity 1) to obtain the sucrose gradient profile while the fractions (0.5ml) are manually collected.3.  Place the fractions in a container with liquid nitrogen, as they are collected, to freeze them quickly and then store at -80~^°C until use. Representative examples of the expected profiles are shown in Figure 2.()Position in gradient()Position in gradientFigure 2. Sedimentation profiles showing the free subunits and 70S vacant ribosomes. The Synechocystis S30 supernatant was fractionated on a 10-30% sucrose density gradient in the presence of 1 mM (A) or 10m M (B)  M g^2+ . Small numbers refer to collected fractions. Adapted from (Galmozzi et al., 2016).4.  The treatment of the fractions from this point depends on the use that will be given to them. In the case of analysis by Western blot, precipitate the total protein with 100% (w/v) TCA (see Recipes).a.  Add 55ul of this solution to each fraction ( 10% TCA final concentration), incubate on ice for 30min and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5415 R) at maximal speed and 4^°C for 10m i n .b.  Discard the supernatant and add 1 ml of -20~^°C chilled acetone to each fraction pellet to eliminate residual TCA.c.  Remove the acetone carefully as not to affect the integrity of the pellet.d.  Dry the pellets through evaporation of acetone by incubating the tubes at 60~^°C in a thermoblock.e.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-2993","title":"In situ Hybridization (ISH) and Quantum Dots (QD) of miRNAs","text":"In situ Hybridization (ISH) and Quantum Dots (QD) of miRNAs\n\n# Abstract\n\nmiRNA are short non-coding RNA which inhibit translation of mRNA. miRNA regulate several cellular processes. Certain miRNA are known to induce oncogenesis. miRNA can be measured by realtime PCR and be imaged using a combination of in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantum dots (QD). The advantage of using quantum dots is that several miRNA can be simultaneously measured using multiplexed QD. Additionally, miRNA can be visualized in different regions of the tissue. Since miRNA are biomarkers of various disease states, miRNA can be visualized and quantitated in tissue sections for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Here we describe ISH-QD analysis of tissue sections. Tissue sections from xenografts or clinical specimens are used. These are deparaffinized, treated with Proteinase K and hybridized with a biotin-probe to specific to the miRNA. The in situ hybridization is performed by labeling the biotin-probes and followed by labeling with streptavidin tagged quantum dots. Image acquisition of the quantum dots is performed and analyzed for the miRNA expression levels. Combining ISH and QD gives a powerful tool to detect miRNA in different cells of the tissue.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Gloves\n2.  Tissue slides\n3.  Superfrost plus slides\n4.

Knowledge of synthetic lethal interactions can allow for elucidation of network structure and identification of candidate drug targets for human diseases such as cancer. In Drosophila, combinatorial gene disruption has been achieved previously by combining multiple RNAi reagents. Here we describe a protocol for highthroughput combinatorial gene disruption by combining CRISPR and RNAi. This approach previously resulted in the identification of highly reproducible and conserved synthetic lethal interactions (Housden et al., 2015).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  10 cm dish (e.g., Corning, catalog number: 430167)\n2.

Cells should be cultured under standard conditions: 25^°C , with ambient C O_2 levels.2.  Split cells 1:5 using complete media and culture for 3 days (or until almost 100% confluent but without overlapping cells).3.  Remove all media and replace with 10ml complete media.4.  Immediately detach cells by gently pipetting the complete media using a 10ml pipette to wash the cells off the bottom of the dish/flask, then transfer 5~ml of cell suspension to a new dish or flask and add an additional 5ml complete media.5.  Grow for 16 h (no longer). Check to ensure that the cells look healthy at this point.6.  Collect media and sterilize using a 0.2um filter to remove all cells.7.  Dilute media 1:1 using high-serum media. Store at 4^°C up to four weeks.B.  Generation of mutant cell lines1.  Design and generate a sgRNA expression plasmid using the pl18 vector as described previously (Housden et al., 2016).2.  Seed  S2R+ cells in complete media into a 6-well plate such that cells will be 40-80% confluent upon attachment (2-8×10^5 cells per well in 1 ml complete media). Allow to attach for 20 min at _25°0 .3.  Transfect cells with 40 ng act-GFP plasmid and 360 ng of sgRNA expression plasmid from step B1 using 10~ul Effectene reagent according to the standard Effectene Transfection Reagent protocol.4.  Incubate cells at _25°0 for 4 days.5.  Place 100ul conditioned media in each well of three clear-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates.6.  Aspirate spent media from transfected cells and detach by gentle pipetting with 1 m l P B S/1% FBS. Filter cell suspension through a 40um filter to remove cell aggregates.7.  Use FACS to isolate the top 10% of GFP expressing cells, excluding the top 1% of GFP cells (which are generally not viable). See Note 1 and Figure 1.8.  Seed 100 cells into well A1 of each 96-well culture plate (this will be used to find the focal plane in step B10) and a single cell into the remaining 95 wells of each plate.9.  Seal plate edges with Parafilm and place in a humidity chamber inside a 25^°C incubator.10. Incubate plates for 2 weeks and then examine each well under a microscope to identify those containing colonies, using well A1 to focus the microscope.11. For wells containing colonies that have grown to a sufficient size (see Figure 2 for examples of suitable colonies), resuspend the colony in the media already in the well by gentle pipetting with a 100ul pipette. Mix 50~ul of the cell suspension with 75ul conditioned media and transfer to a well of a new 96-well plate. Use the remaining 50~ul cell suspension for a genomic DNA preparation for analysis of mutations.12. Identify mutant colonies using the previously described genomic DNA and HRMA protocols (Housden and Perrimon, 2016).13. Confirm that mutations are homozygous frameshifts by sequencing TOPO-cloned PCR product from step B12 using M13F and M13R primers. We recommend sequencing at least 20 TOPOcloned constructs for each sample to ensure that all allele sequences of the target gene are identified.14. Following identification of mutant clones, the relevant cell population can be expanded by serially transferring from the 96-well plate to a 24-well plate and then a 6-well plate and finally a 10 cm dish or T75 flask. Cells should be transferred using conditioned media until they reach a 6-well plate, at which point complete media can be used. Transfers should be performed when cells reach confluence at each stage.()Figure 1. FACS setup for isolation of single GFP positive cells. GFP positive cells are isolated by first selecting viable cells (A), then removing doublets (B), then identifying all GFP positive cells (C) and finally selecting the top 10% of GFP expressing cells for sorting (D). Gating hierarchy is shown in panel E.()Figure 2. Examples of suitable colonies for expansion and sequence analysis# C. dsRNA screen1.  Defrost the 384-well dsRNA assay plates from -80~^°C storage and centrifuge at 805 x g for 2 min before use.2.  Remove media from cells cultured in T75 flasks or 10 cm dishes using a Pasteur pipette while taking care not to detach the cells. Note that  S2R+ cells are adherent but will detach easily when disturbed.3.  Add 10ml serum-free media warmed to room temperature to each T75 flask or 10 cm dish. Use this media to detach the cells by gentle pipetting and transfer to a 15ml conical tube.4.  Count cells using a haemocytometer and dilute to 500,000 cells per ml with fresh serum-free media.5.  Remove seals from each assay plate, holding the plate down while the seal is pulled away.6.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3015","title":"Production, Purification and Crystallization of a Prokaryotic SLC26 Homolog for Structural Studies","text":"Production, Purification and Crystallization of a Prokaryotic SLC26 Homolog for Structural Studies\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe SLC26 or SulP proteins constitute a large family of anion transporters that are ubiquitously expressed in pro- and eukaryotes. In human, SLC26 proteins perform important roles in ion homeostasis and malfunctioning of selected members is associated with diseases. This protocol details the production and crystallization of a prokaryotic SLC26 homolog, termed SLC26Dg, from Deinococcus geothermalis. Following these instructions we obtained well-folded and homogenous material of the membrane protein SLC26Dg and the nanobody Nb5776 that enabled us to crystallize the complex and determine its structure (Geertsma et al., 2015). The procedure may be adapted to purify and crystallize other membrane protein complexes.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Make a rectangular well ( Z×4 cm square, 0.5 cm depth) at the center of gel stage by cutting and removing upper layer of the gel.()Figure 2. Agarose gel stageB.  Preparation of transplantation needle1.  Pull the glass capillary with the micropipette puller to make a needle with a thin and long shaft. We routinely pull the glass capillary using the same conditions as for microinjection needles (our settings: heat 570, pull 150, velocity 120, time 60).2.  Set the pulled needle on the microforge, break the needle with forceps at a site where the inside diameter is approximately 20~um . Make the end as blunt as possible with forceps. Using the microforge heater, make the needle end smooth and further make a harpoon.()Figure 3. Transplantation needle. Scale bar =50~um .C.  Preparation of donor mesenchymal cells of whole regenerate including blastema (Video 1)Video 1. Transplantation of mesenchymal cells including the blastema in regenerating zebrafish fin()1.  Two days before transplantation, anaesthetize the donor zebrafish with 1x tricaine solution (30 ml or enough volume to cover the fish body) in a plastic dish and cut their caudal fins with a scalpel. Note that the fins of host fish need to be amputated simultaneously. The amputated fish were returned to aquarium and normally fed until transplantation.2.  On the day of transplantation (2 days post amputation dpa), anaesthetize the donor fish with tricaine and cut the fin regenerate with a scalpel.3.  Transfer the fin regenerate with forceps to a glass dish containing 5-10 ml L-15 medium supplemented with 0.01% FBS.4.  Remove the wound epidermis from the regenerate (mesenchymal part) using the dissection needles as forceps. Peel the epidermis from the proximal side and remove the whole epidermis by gently pulling the epidermis from the edge as if taking off a T-shirt.5.  Divide the mesenchymal part of the regenerate to respective fin ray units. If necessary, theblastema can be further cut into smaller sizes.D.  Transplantation (Video 1)1.  Set the transplantation needle into the needle holder of manipulator.2.  Anaesthetize the host zebrafish with tricaine and place it on the agarose stage (Figure 4 and Figure 5).()Figure 4. Zebrafish fin and the transplantation needle()# Figure 5. Microscope and manipulator set up3.  Make an opening on the surface of wound epidermis using the transplantation needle. Push the needle onto the regenerate surface and tap the head of manipulator knob to break the epidermis.4.  Transfer a piece of donor mesenchymal tissue including the blastema to site of the epidermal opening using a P20 micropipette.5.  Push the donor mesenchymal tissue with the transplantation needle to insert into the host regenerate. Hook the donor mesenchymal tissue with harpoon of the needle and force to insert into the host regenerate. Because proximal side of the donor mesenchyme is rigid, it is easier to hook the proximal side. Note that it is difficult to push the tissue with thinner needles. Transplantation can be performed for several fin rays at a time, but either of dorsal or ventral# bio-protocolside of the fin should be blank as a regeneration control.6.  Put the operated fish back to aquarium (Figure 6).# Notes:a.  Only regenerating fins are amenable to transplantation. Removing the epidermis from the regenerate is easily done with 1.5-2.5 dpa regenerating fin. The host tissue should also be 1.5-2.5 dpa. Only the thick region in the regenerating fin can be used as a host tissue. The transplanted cells in the blastema proliferate to produce lots of progeny cells within fin ray, and this is a hallmark that the transplanted cells incorporated as a part of fin mesenchyme.b. Though we have not traced the transplanted cells beyond 14 dpa, in some cases we observed a significant decrease of donor cells, which could be due to the transplant rejection by host immune system.()Figure 6. A representative example of blastema transplantation. The fin of the Tg(β- actin:dsred2) was amputated 2 days before transplantation, and the blastema tissue was transplanted into the blastema region of wild-type host.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3040","title":"Generation of Tumour-stroma Minispheroids for Drug Efficacy Testing","text":"Generation of Tumour-stroma Minispheroids for Drug Efficacy Testing\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe three-dimensional organisation of cells in a tissue and their interaction with adjacent cells and extracellular matrix is a key determinant of cellular responses, including how tumour cells respond to stress conditions or therapeutic drugs (Elliott and Yuan, 2011). In vivo, tumour cells are embedded in a stroma formed primarily by fibroblasts that produce an extracellular matrix and enwoven with blood vessels. The 3D mixed cell type spheroid model described here incorporates these key features of the tissue microenvironment that in vivo tumours exist in; namely the three-dimensional organisation, the most abundant stromal cell types (fibroblasts and endothelial cells), and extracellular matrix. This method combined with confocal microscopy can be a powerful tool to carry out drug sensitivity, angiogenesis and cell migration/invasion assays of different tumour types.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  96 U-shaped well plate for suspension cells (Greiner Bio One, catalog number: 650161)\n2.

Harvest MDA-MB-231 cells by trypsinization. Collect 1×10^5 cells by centrifuging at 300xg for 5 min and resuspend them in 0.1 ml fresh growth medium (obtaining a cell concentration of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml).3.  Label MDA-MB-231 cells with the cell tracker dye CM-Dil or CMTPX by incubating the 0.1 ml of cell suspension with 2uM of either of the two dyes for 30m i n at 37^°C in the dark, shaking every 5 to 10 min.

C. Collection of formed spheres from U-shaped wells using a 5~ml serological pipette.Note: The pipette is gently placed to the bottom of the well and the content collected. The pipette is then moved to the next well without releasing the collected medium. The medium with the tumour spheres collected in the pipette from several wells is then transferred into a 15 m I centrifuge tube (not shown).B.  Drug efficacy testing on multicellular tumour spheroids1.  Prepare a 1.5 m g/ m l collagen type-I stock solution by diluting rat tail collagen type-I into an appropriate volume of EGM-2 medium. Neutralize the pH to 7.0 by drop-wise addition of 1 N NaOH. Filter-sterilise the final solution using a syringe and syringe filter. Prepare this solution fresh each time.2.  Add 100ul of collagen stock solution to the bottom of wells of a glass-bottom 12 well dish which has been previously warmed to 37^°C in the incubator. Incubate dish at 37^°C for 30 min to allow the collagen gel to set.3.  At the end of the 24~h incubation, gently harvest the formed spheroids from the 96 U-shaped well plate into a 15ml centrifuge tube using a 5ml or a 10ml serological pipette and collect the spheroids by centrifuging the solution at 300xg for 5 min.Copyright  2017 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.Note: An image of the harvesting step is shown in Figure 1C. Typically, one sphere forms per well, though it may vary for different cell types.4.  Remove the medium, taking care not to disturb the spheroid pellet. Add 1,400~ul freshly prepared 1.5 m g/ m l collagen stock solution and carefully resuspend the spheroid pellet by tapping the bottom of the tube.5.  Add 100ul of spheroid suspension on top of each collagen gel in the 12 well plate to generate between 5-8 spheroids per well. Place the plate in incubator at 37^°C for 1h to allow this second collagen gel layer to set. Note: It may take a bit longer for the gel to set. Proceed with the protocol only after the gel has set, but not later than _2.5h .6.  Add 1.5ml of EGM-2 medium to each well and incubate the spheroids for 24-48~h~ .

Their molecular structure, which might influence their chemical reactivity, can be assessed by the use of both HPLC-UV after acid thiolysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thiolysis of plant extracts in acidic methanol with cysteamine hydrochloride results in the release of the monomeric units of the condensed tannin oligomers that can be further quantified by reversed-phase HPLC-UV by comparison with analytical standards. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix and K^+ as cationization agent highlights the molecular structural characteristics (e.g., monomeric unit sequence) of the tannin oligomers. The methodologies permit the estimation of the mean and the maximum (observable) degree of polymerization, the type of monomeric units and the presence of glycosylation and/or esterification of the tannin oligomers.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  1 ml Eppendorf tubes\n2.  2 ml Eppendorf tubes\n3.

Dry extracts from plant tissues (e.g., softwood bark) The dry plant extracts could be obtained through different processes. For the extraction of tannins, the maceration of fine milled tissue ecause1 m m in size) in solvents like methanol, acetone or water is suggested. The extraction temperature should be between 30 and 90~^°C , and the extraction time between 10 and 60 min. The drying of the extract has to be performed avoiding\n\nas much as possible post-modification (e.g., oxidation) of the extracts. Vacuum drying and/or freeze-drying are therefore recommended. After drying the extracts should be stored in a refrigerator (3-8 °C), protected from light and air.\n\n6.

Dissolve the dried plant extracts (5m g) in methanol (5ml) and sonicate (35 kHz, 250W) at room temperature for 30m i n .b.  Transfer with an Eppendorf pipette 200~ul of the solubilized extracts in an Eppendorf tube (2ml) and mix it with 200ul of thiolysis media.c.  Put the Eppendorf tube in the water bath set at 65~^°C for 1~h~ to carry on the thiolysis. No shaking of the sample is needed. During the thiolysis the flavan-3-ol monomeric units of the condensed tannins are released in their native state (terminal units) as well as their respective thioethers (extension units), as schematically depicted in Figure 2. Note: The thiolysis is effective only i t condensed tannins are made of catechin and/or gallocatechin units. If tannins are made of fisetinidol, robinetinidol or monomeric units different than flavan-3-ols, the interflavonyl bond will not be cleaved.d.  The thiolysis is quenched with 1~ml of water and the solution is purified through a PTFE 0.45um HPLC filter.e.  Non-thiolyzed reference samples are prepared by dissolving 200~ul of the solubilized extracts in sequence with 200~ul of methanol and 1.0 ml of water, followed by the same thermal treatment as used during the thiolysis (1 h at 65 ^°C_. and purified through a PTFE 0.45um HPLC filter.()Figure 2. Scheme of the condensed tannin thiolysis with cysteamine hydrochloride. R1, R2=H or OH.f.  Prepare calibration stock solutions of the flavan-3-ols (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 g/L in methanol). The calibration standards solutions for HPLC are then prepared by diluting 200~ul of the calibration stock solutions in sequence with 200~ul of methanol and 1.0ml of water. The calibration standard solutions are then thermally treated ( 1 h at 65^°C in a water bath) and purified (PTFE 0.45um HPLC-filter) in the same way as the samples.g.  All samples and calibration standards are sealed in an HPLC vial and stored in a refrigerator between 3 and 8^°C until analysis. The samples remain stable for about 1 week under these conditions.# 2.  Measurementa.  Condition the reversed-phase HPLC-UV system equipped with the Cosmosil column using solution A (see Recipes) at 30^°C .b.  Inject 25ul of the sample (e.g., thiolyzed extract, non-thiolyzed extract, calibration standard) in the HPLC column. Before injection the samples should be conditioned at room temperature for at least 1 h. However, it is recommended to limit the exposition of the sample at room temperature to less than 24h before the HPLC measurement.c.  The mobile phase gradient described in Table 1 was applied at a flow equal to 1 m l/m i n . Compositions of solution A and solution B are described in the section Recipes. The temperature of the column is kept at 30^°C all over the measurement.# Table 1. Mobile phase gradient applied during HPLC measurements()# Notes:i. The quasi-isocratic conditions between 5 and 20 min are needed to achieve a sufficient resolution (separation) of the peaks corresponding to epigallocatechin, catechin and their thioethers. ii. The HPLC measurements should be repeated at least twice on replicated samples, therefore taking into account independent sample preparation, thiolysis, and analysis. d.  Detect the absorbance at 280~n m . An example of the HPLC chromatograms at 280~n m of bark extracts before and after thiolysis is reported in Figure 3.()Retention time (min.)Figure 3. HPLC-UV chromatograms between 10 and 35 min of Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) bark extracts before and after thiolysis. Absorption peaks are associated to various flavanol and flavanol thioethers as follows: texttt1= gallocatechin; textittextbfZ= gallocatechin thioether; raiseboxdepth(chi)= epigallocatechin; 4= catechin; 5= catechin thioether; 6= epigallocatechin thioether; 7:= epicatechin; 8= epicatechin thioether.e.  Integrate the area under the absorption peak(s) that corresponds to the flavan-3-ols and their thioethers.# Notes:i. While analytical standards of native flavan-3-ols are commercially available from chemical substance distributors (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich), no standards are available for flavan-3-ol thioethers. The preparation of flavan-3-ol thioethers standards could be performed only starting from oligomers of known composition (also not easily available) and requires lengthy purification steps (Torres and Bobet, 2001). In the present study the retention times of the flavan-3-ol thioethers were identified by extemporary HPLC-MS measurements performed in an external laboratory using the same column and method and Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC system equipped with a mass detector (Agilent 6130 quadrupole MS).ii. Quantify the concentration of the flavan-3-ols in the thiolyzed and non-thiolyzed samples by comparison with the calibration curves developed for each single flavan-3-ol measuring the corresponding calibration standards. As already mentioned, no calibration standard are commercially available for the flavan-3-ol thioethers.Extemporary measurements performed on epicatechin dimers (proanthocyanidin B2) showed  that,  after  complete  thiolysis  (complete  disappearing  of  the  peak corresponding to the epicatechin dimer) the peaks corresponding to epicatechin and epicatechin-thioether had almost an equal absorption area. The concentration of all flavan-3-ol thioethers was then calculated using for the flavanol thioethers the same UV molar absorption (M^A B S) of the corresponding native flavan-3-ols (e.g., M^A B S of epicatechin thioether was considered equal to M^A B S of epicatechin). In Table 2 the M^A B S for the measured flavan-3-ols are reported.Table 2. Molar absorption factor (M^ A B S) of flavan-3-ols and flavan-3-ol thioethers()B.  MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry1.  Sample preparationa.  Dissolve the dried plant extracts (2.5m g) in 1~ml of aqueous acetone (50%) and sonicate (35:k H z,250:W) at room temperature for 30m i n .b.  Prepare a matrix solution by dissolving 10mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1 ml of pure acetone.c.  In Eppendorf tube (1 m) mix 10~ul of the extract solution with 10~ul of matrix solution and spike it with 1~ul of KCl ( 10 /L in water) to enhance the formation of potassiated ions and suppress the formation of sodiated and/or other types of ions. Note: Plant tissues might contain different kinds of salts, which may consequently contribute to the ion formation during the MALDI ionization process. For correct spectra interpretation it is therefore essentially important to ensure the formation of only one type of ions (e.g., either sodiated or potassiated, or others). Of particular concern are already mentioned sodium and potassium ions, because these two salts are common constituents in plant tissues. The mass difference between Na^+ and K^+ is 16 amu, which is also a mass difference between the building units of the condensed tannins (Table 4). Thus, unintended formation of Na^+ and K^+ ions at the same time may result in errors in spectra interpretation.d.  Deposit 5~ul of the mixture on the MALDI-TOF stainless steel plate and allow it to dry at room temperature for about 1~h~ .e.  The samples should be stored at room temperature and measured at the same day of thepreparation.2.  Measurementa.  Set the MALDI TOF mass spectrometer in positive linear mode with a monitoring range between 700 and 4,500m/z .b.  Calibrate the MALDI TOF mass spectrometer with the calibration standard (e.g., Peptide calibration standard II, Bruker Daltonics, Germany)c.

Prepare dissection medium and culture medium in a laminar flow hood.3.  Pre-acclimatise culture medium to 37^°C in incubator.4.  Swab the tissue chopper with 70% ethanol and secure a fresh razor blade in place, which has been wiped first with acetone to remove any grease and then swabbed with 70% ethanol.5.  Make up fresh sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid.6.  Terminally anaesthetise mouse, aged between 8-20 days by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60m g/k g) . When all pedal withdrawal reflexes have ceased and there is no response to a strong pinch of the hind limb, nor a corneal reflex, the animal is considered to be sufficiently anaesthetised for the procedure.7.  Open the chest up and cut away the rib cage to expose the heart. A trans-cardiac perfusion is then performed through the left ventricle with ^25ml of ice cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid to enhance viability of slices. This is illustrated by Gage et al. (2012). Note: This procedure is carried out using fixative and for this protocol, sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid is administered via a syringe – a pump system is not required.8.  Remove the dorsal skin and perform a dorsal laminectomy to expose the spinal cord. Remove the spinal cord using fine spring scissors and fine forceps and place in a 50~m m Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium (Figure 2). This is procedure is illustrated in a video taken from Gunther et al. (2012). Note: In this example the procedure is carried on fixed tissue. For organotypic slice cultures the spinal cord must not be placed in paraformaldehyde solution after it has been dissected free but in cold dissection medium.()Figure 2. A series of images depicting the dissection of the spinal cord9.  Remove the meninges (pia, arachnoid and dura mater) under a dissecting microscope, using fine forceps. Select the mid-lower thoracic/upper lumbar region of the spinal cord (approximately T8-L2; Figure 3).()Figure 3. Removing the meninges from the spinal cord. A. A diagram displaying the meninges (taken from Medical Dictionary, accessed May 2016); B. An image depicting removal of the meninges; C. A diagram displaying the region selected for culture.10. Transfer the selected region of spinal cord, using a microspatula, onto a sterile filter paper moistened with dissection medium that is situated on the plate of the tissue chopper and cut 300um transverse slices.11. Transfer the slices, using a microspatula, to a Petri dish containing ice cold dissection medium, this will remove any excitotoxic chemicals and debris.12. Under a dissection microscope using fine forceps and a microspatula, separate the slices and discard any damaged slices. Note: All procedures from this point onwards are performed in a laminar flow hood.13. Pipette 1 ml of pre-acclimatised culture medium into each well of a sterile 6-well culture plate and, using sterile forceps, place a millicell organotypic filter insert on top of the culture medium.14. Immediately following this, using a Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip that has had the end cut off to widen the diameter (thus limiting damage to the slices), transfer 2 to 6 slices onto each filter. Care must be taken that the slices are not touching each other or the side of the filter. Remove all excess medium from around the slice by means of a Gilson pipette with sterile tip; ensure there is no medium above the filter (Figure 4).()Figure 4. Method for preparing organotypic slice culture15. Transfer culture plate to the incubator, where slices are maintained at 37~^°C under standard conditions; 100% humidity, 95% air, 5% C O_2 enriched environment.16. After ^24~h~ in culture, using sterile forceps to lift the organotypic filter insert carefully out of the well, remove culture medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip and replace the culture medium with 1~ml of serum-free medium using Gilson P1000 pipette with a sterile tip. Carefully place filter back onto the fresh medium, ensuring that there are no air bubbles under the filter. The serum is required initially, as it aids the slices in recovery from the trauma of explantation. The key advantage of changing to serum free medium is that the exact constituents can be determined. Serum may also contain substances that influence the growth of a particular population of cells and may promote microglial proliferation (Coltman and Ide, 1996).17. For the remaining time in culture, remove half the medium (0.5m) ) and replace with 0.5ml of fresh serum free medium, every second day. This technique leaves some of the natural growth factors, which assists in maintaining good viability in the cultured slices. The cultured slices maintain good morphology (Figure 5).()Figure 5. An organotypic spinal cord slice growing in cultureB.  Addition of 5-ethynyl- calZ^ -deoxyuridine (EdU) to organotypic cultures1.  After 48h in culture, add 1~ul of EdU (1 m M) directly to the 1 ml of medium in each well. Add fresh EdU (0.5~u/) following any subsequent medium changes. EdU is a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA during active synthesis in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Figure 6) (Chehrehasa et al., 2009) providing a fast and reproducible method to employ for the study of cell proliferation (Figure 7).Note: This stage can be omitted if you do not wish to investigate cell proliferation.()Figure 6. EdU is incorporated into the newly synthesised DNA and visualised with addition of click chemistry and a fluorescent azideFigure 7. Timeline for culturing slices. Schematic of the timing for culturing slices and addition of EdU.()2.  After the allotted time in culture, fix the slices by removing the filter from the 6-well culture plate, with slices in situ and place on top of 1~ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer in a new 6-well culture plate. Carefully apply a further 500~ul of the 4% paraformaldehyde solution on top of the filter, covering the slices completely.3.  Leave slices in fixative for 6h at 4^°C .4.  Using a fine paint brush, carefully ease the slice free from the filter and place individually in 500 ul0.1 M phosphate buffered saline in a 24-well histology tray. Note: Slices can be stored at 4^°C in phosphate buffered saline for up to 7 days at this point.# C.  EdU detection in organotypic culturesSlices are kept in the 24-well histology tray throughout and this technique of free floating the slices is continued during the procedure. Each solution is removed from the well carefully at the end of allotted time using a pipette and the next solution carefully added by allowing it to run down the side of the well and not directly on top of the delicate slices. Unless otherwise stated, all steps are carried out at room temperature, with gentle agitation of the sections on a shaker plate.1.  Incubate in 500ul PBS with 0.2% Triton for 12m i n .2.  Wash 2×10 min in 500ul 0.1 M Tris buffer.3.  Incubate slices in a mix of 320~ul distilled water, 25~ul Tris buffer (2 M), 50ul copper sulphate :10m M) ), 5ul biotinylated azide (1 mM) and 100ul ascorbic acid (0.5M) in each well (make up fresh each time) for 30m i n .4.  Wash 2 x 10 min in 500 µl 0.1 M Tris buffer.5.  Wash 1x10 min in 500ul PBS.6.  Incubate in Streptavidin Alexa555 1:1,000 in 500~ul PBS with 0.1 % Triton for 1~h~ , protect from light by wrapping histology tray in tin foil for this and any subsequent steps.7.  Wash 3 x 10 min in 500ulP B S .8.  The sections can then be immunohistochemically labelled with appropriate antibodies following instructions of the supplier at this stage before mounting (Figure 8). Note: The slices are not agitated for longer than 2 h in the primary antibodies, as they start to disintegrate. If longer incubation time is required, leave in the histology tray without agitation at 4^°C .9.  Free float the slices in a Petri dish of distilled water and carefully float the slice onto a glass slideand guide into position with a fine paint brush.10. Protect from light and allow to air dry.11. Mount using VectaShield mounting media with or without DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).12.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3184","title":"Evaluation of Angiogenesis Inhibitors Using the HUVEC Fibrin Bead Sprouting Assay","text":"Evaluation of Angiogenesis Inhibitors Using the HUVEC Fibrin Bead Sprouting Assay\n\n# Abstract\n\nAngiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a critical process that occurs during normal development and tumor formation. Targeting tumor angiogenesis by blocking the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has demonstrated some clinical benefit; nevertheless there is a great need to target additional angiogenic pathways. We have found that the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) fibrin bead sprouting assay (FBA) is a robust and predictive in vitro assay to evaluate the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors. Here, we describe an optimized FBA protocol for the assessment of biological inhibitors of angiogenesis and the automated quantification of key endpoints.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 50 m l conical tubes (Corning, Falcon®, catalog number: 352070)\n2.

Preparation of reagents1.  Siliconization and sterilizationa.  Add 5 ml of Sigmacote to clean glass bottles in order to prevent the beads from sticking to the glassware. b.  Rotate the vessel or glassware to ensure that the Sigmacote covers the entire surface of the glass bottle. c.  Aspirate excess Sigmacote from the glassware and allow to air dry in a laminar flow hood. d.  Thoroughly wash the glassware in deionized tissue culture grade water. A minimum of two washings is suggested. e.  Sterilize glassware by autoclaving. ote: Once glassware has been siliconized, it is not necessary to treat prior to each use.2.  Cytodex bead preparation a.  In a 50ml Falcon tube, hydrate 0.5: dry beads in 50ml PBS .p H=7.4 ). Place on a rocker for at least 3h at RT.b.  Let beads settle (neg5m i n) . Aspirate the supernatant using a pipette and wash 3×5 min in 50ml fresh PBS using a rocker at RT. Do not vortex. c.  Aspirate PBS using a pipette and replace with fresh PBS (50~ml) such that the bead concentration is 10mg/ml or 30,000 beads/ml. d.  Transfer the bead suspension in a siliconized glass bottle. e.  Sterilize the beads by autoclaving for 15 min at 115^°C . f.  Store at 4^°C . 3.  Fibrinogen solution preparation (see Recipes) 4.  Thrombin stock solution preparation (see Recipes) 5.  Aprotinin stock solution preparation (see Recipes)# B.  Preparation of cellsChange the growth media for HUVECs and fibroblasts to EGM-2 media 1 day before use. For HUVECs, switch medium to EGM-2 the day before beading. For fibroblasts, switch the FGM-2 medium to EGM-2 the day before embedding in fibrin. Beading requires 400 HUVECs per bead. Use 20,000 fibroblasts per well of a 24-well plate.C.  Coating the beads with HUVEC (Day-1)1.  Warm EGM-2 media in a water bath set to 37^°C .2.  Trypsinize HUVECs which should be 80% confluent. Wash cells with PBS and then add 3ml of trypsin. Allow trypsin to remain on cells for approximately 2 min or until cells begin to detach from the flask. Add EGM-2 media to neutralize the trypsin and bring the total volume to 10ml . Spin cells in a centrifuge, remove supernatant with an aspirator, and adjust cell concentration to 2×10^6c e l l s/m l. .3.  Under sterile conditions, place 170ul bead solution (stock concentration: 30,000 beads/ml) in a FACS tube. This should be 5,000 beads. Allow beads to settle (do not centrifuge), aspirate the supernatant, and wash the beads in _2 m of warm EGM-2 medium. Remove media using a pipette and add fresh warm media for a total volume of _2m l .4.  Add 2×10^6 HUVEC ( 1~ml of 2 x 106 cells/ml) to 5,000 beads (in _2m l ) in the FACS tube (total volume 3ml ). Place tube vertically in the incubator. This will be enough for 20 wells.5.  Incubate for 4h at 37~^°C , inverting and mixing the tube every 20 min. Beads should look like mini golf balls after beading (Figure 1).6.  After 4h , transfer the coated beads to a T25 tissue culture flask and leave overnight in a total volume of 5ml of EGM-2 at 37^°C and 5% CO2.D.  Embedding coated beads in fibrin gel (Day 0)1.  Add 0.15 Units/ml of aprotinin to 15ml of fibrinogen solution. 2.  Check HUVEC coated beads. Transfer 5ml of coated beads to a 15ml conical tube and let the beads settle. Use additional 5ml of media to wash off beads that are stuck to flask.3.  Let beads settle to the bottom of the tube. Aspirate off media. Re-suspend beads in 1 ml of EGM-2 and transfer to a 1.5ml centrifuge tube.4.  Wash the beads _2× with 1~ml of EGM-2, mixing by pipetting up and down very slowly/carefully (beads are fragile) with a P1000 pipette.5.  Add 6.25~ul of thrombin stock solution (50 U/mI) to the center of each well of a 24-well plate. This will result in 0.625U/ml once 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead suspension is added in the next step.6.  Get fibrinogen/bead mixture into solution by pipetting up and down gently. Add 0.5~ml of fibrinogen/bead suspension to each well.7.  Mix the thrombin and the fibrinogen/beads by pipetting up and down gently ~five times. Change the pipette tip for each well in order to prevent clotting in the pipette tip between wells. Avoid creating bubbles in the fibrin gel (may hinder visibility in gel). Do not move the plate in order to avoid tearing of the fibrin gel. Note: Usually, when the fibrin gel is formed, tiny bubbles will be present in the gel. They will disappear in 3 to 4 days.8.  Allow the fibrinogen/bead solution to solidify for 5 min at RT in hood. It is important that the plate is not disturbed during the first 5 min of clotting because sheared fibrin reduces sprouting. After 5 min, check under microscope to see if beads are evenly distributed (not clumped together). Ideally there should be 200-250 beads per well. Note: Increasing the number of beads per well results in earlier anastomosis.9.  Then incubate at 37^°C and 5% CO2 for 10-15 min.10. While waiting, trypsinize fibroblasts and re-suspend in EGM adjusted to 1×10^6c e l l/ml (or 1,000 cells/μl) Note: Fibroblasts will proliferate, migrate and form a monolayer on the fibrin gel.11. Prepare the appropriate amount of EGM-2 media containing the angiogenesis inhibitor of choice (aflibercept at 50 u/m l , Dll4 MAB at 50u/m l , Integrin a-6 antibody GoH3 at 10ugim/ml) ).12. After incubation, add 1 ml of EGM-2 prepared to each well slowly (drop by drop). If media is added too fast, it could tear the gel.13. Seed 20ul of NHLF cell solution (20,000 cells) on top of the clot into each well. Add directly into the center of well and into the media.14. Replace with fresh EGM-2 medium every other day (day 2, 5, 7, etc.) until desired growth (see notes below) is achieved and capture images accordingly. Notes: a.  Budding/sprouting should be apparent between day 2 and 4. b.  Lumen formation begins around day 4 to 5 and sprouts continue to elongate. c.  Newly formed tubes begin to branch around day 4 to 6. d.  By day 6 to 7, the microvessel-like structures begin to anastomose (connection of two structures) with adjoining tubes.# bio-protocolE.  Gel processing and sprout staining for DNA and actin1.  To stop the assay, 500~ul of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) is added to the gels for 1 h at 37~^°C , followed by overnight incubation at room temperature (RT). Wash twice with PBS.2.  To stain the endothelial sprouts, gels are permeabilized with 500ul of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, washed twice with PBS.3.  Incubate with the mixture of 500ul of Phalloidin-TRITC (1:1,000) and Hoechst 33258 (1:2,000) in PBS for 1 h at RT.4.  Wash twice with PBS. Note: For qualitative assessment of endothelial sprouting, EGM-2 medium-covered 24-well plates can be imaged with an inverted microscope under bright field settings at desired time points (Figure2).F.  Image acquisition on ImageXpressMICRO XL1.  Fibrin beads assays are performed in 24 well optical plates (Sensoplate).2.

Essential Oil on Fusarium graminearum Determined by UHPLC and RT-qPCR","text":"Antifungal and Zearalenone Inhibitory Activity of Ocimum sanctum L. Essential Oil on Fusarium graminearum Determined by UHPLC and RT-qPCR\n\n# Abstract\n\nFusarium graminearum has been given special attention in the context of agricultural commodities due to its ability to grow in diverse climatic conditions, and to produce different mycotoxins including zearalenone (ZEA) and type-B trichothecenes, which cause ill health effects on humans, animals and plants. The application of synthetic antifungal agents for the control of F. graminearum result in negative health impacts in livestock and humans and the upsurge of resistant organisms as well. Therefore, there is a need to propose proper food grain management practices, including the application of herbal antifungal and mycotoxin controlling agents, to reduce the growth of toxigenic F. graminearum as well as the production of ZEA in agricultural commodities. Ocimum sanctum also known as Holy Basil or Tulsi is widely used as a medicinal plant in Ayurveda. The current protocol demonstrates to quantify the antifungal activity of O. sanctum L. essential oil (OSEO) as reflected by the decreased F. graminearum growth and ZEA production. Antifungal activities of OSEO are carried out by micro well dilution method and further validated quantitatively by scanning electron microscopic methods. Effects of OSEO on ZEA production is analysed by Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) methods from a broth culture of F. graminearum. Anti-mycotoxic efficacy of OSEO is assessed directly on F. graminearum inoculated maize grains. The protocol efficiently assessed the activity of OSEO as an herbal antagonistic agent against fungal infestation and ZEA production by F. graminearum. The protocol can be used to test a wide variety of herbal compounds for antifungal activity against F. graminearum or with modifications on other mycotoxigenic fungi, an important intervention in food safety and processing industries where the fungal infestation is a major concern.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 0.22um Millex-GP syringe filter unit (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: Z359904)\n2.  96-well microtiter plates (Eppendorf, catalog number: 0030602200)\n3.

The cut-off value for the virus back titration is the mean of the VC median and the CC median. This is the same cut-off value that is used to calculate neutralizing antibody titers. The dilution of the first well below the cut-off value is the back titration titer. The dilutions in the back titration wells are beginning at well A: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3310","title":"Sensitive Assessment of Hippocampal Learning Using Temporally Dissociated Passive Avoidance Task","text":"Sensitive Assessment of Hippocampal Learning Using Temporally Dissociated Passive Avoidance Task\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe temporally dissociated passive avoidance (TDPA) paradigm is a variant of passive avoidance testing, and allows for more sensitive investigation of mild impairments in avoidance learning. Passive avoidance learning measures the latency to enter a “dark” context in which an aversive stimulus (foot shock) has been previously experienced using a light-dark box paradigm. Briefly, the animal is placed into the light side of the box and the time spent to cross into the dark side is measured. After entry into the dark chamber, the animal receives a mild (0.4-1.6 m A) ) footshock and is removed from the box. After a period of time, typically 24~h (note that this is entirely dependent on whether various levels of memory retention, e.g., short or long, are being measured), the animal is placed back into the box and cross-over latency is measured. Passive avoidance is learned after one trial and results in a robust increase in crossover latency. This behavior requires the association between a normally neutral environment  and  an  aversive  stimulus,  and  is  dependent  on  hippocampal  function (Stubley-Weatherly et al., 1996; Impey et al., 1998). TDPA extends this learning across multiple once-daily trials, producing a more graded and malleable latency score, and thus allows a more sensitive evaluation of changes in hippocampal function The task remains dependent on an intact hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2008), and subtle changes in hippocampal gene expression can result in robust alterations in TDPA latency scores (Eagle et al., 2015). We describe here a common method used to assess TDPA learning in mice.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Adult (7 weeks or older) mice (C57BL/6J) (the Jackson laboratory) Note: C57BL/6J mice are typical, though alternate strains and ages of mice may also be used. Mice are housed singly or in groups of 4-5 per cage. Conditions should comply with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8^t h ed. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-for-the-Care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals. pdf). See Animals considerations in Notes for more details.\n2.  Ethanol ( 70% volume/volume) diluted in distilled water\n\n# Equipment\n\n1.  Light-dark box (14 in. W x 7 in. D x 12 in. H) equipped with overhead houselight (light side only), guillotine-style door, drop pan, and shock-capable grid flooring (Coulbourn Instruments, model: H10-11M-PA)\n2.  Precision animal shocker (Coulbourn Instruments, model: H13-15) and cable\n3.  Video  camera,  IR-capable  (Panasonic  Corporation  of  North  America,  model: WV-CP304), mounted in front of box with side-view of light chamber and door\n4.  Timer\n5.  Sound-attenuating cubicle, as needed Note: For example, Coulbourn Instruments provides a range of isolation cubicles in different sizes (H10-24 series) that are suitable for the needs of this experiment.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n1.  Set up equipment (Figure 1). Clean the light-dark chamber with 70% ethanol/water solution on all surface areas and wipe clean. Make sure doorway between light side and dark side is closed. Turn on houselight. Turn on shocker and adjust for pre-determined shock intensity (see below).()# Figure 1. Example of a light-dark box2.  Place mouse in light chamber of the light-dark box. Wait approximately 60 sec for mouse to acclimate to light side. Mice will freely explore the entire light side. Before opening the door, ensure the mouse is facing away from the door (at least 45^° ) and at least 5 cm from the door. This prevents impulsive entry upon door movement. Note that the door will make an audible click upon opening.3.  Raise the door separating the dark side from the light side of the light-dark box. Start the timer to measure cross-over latency, defined as the duration after door opens for mouse to enter the dark side of the light-dark box. Crossover is defined by full body entry (including tail). Stop the timer when the mouse enters the dark side of the chamber.Note: Mice may enter halfway and dart back into the light side. This is more likely after repeated daily trials. Do not lower the door until the mouse has fully crossed over.4.  Once the mouse has crossed over, lower the door. After repeated trials, most non-experimental mice (e.g., wild-type C57BL/6J with no manipulation) will reach criterion. Criterion typically consists of 300-600 sec in the light side without any crossover. The determination of the criterion is entirely dependent on the experiment. Once an animal has reached criterion it is manually removed from the light side (no footshock is given). It no longer undergoes additional testing and crossover latency is considered maximal for remaining sessions.5.  After a specific amount of time in the dark side (see below), apply a single foot-shock to the grid floor. The amount of time and the shock intensity will determine (affect) cross-over latency in subsequent trials (see Figure 2).()Figure 2. Hypothetical effects of varying delay to shock and shock intensity in the TDPA task. A. Increases in delay to shock (2 s e c-10 m i n) reduce latency to crossover. B. Increases in shock intensity (0.0-1.6m A) ) increase latency to crossover.6.  Allow the mouse to remain in the dark chamber for 30 sec after the foot shock to associate the environment with the aversive stimulus, then remove mouse to home cage.7.  All the urine and fecal boli must be removed from both sides of the chamber, and the chamber cleaned entirely with 70% ethanol to remove any residual smell from the first mouse. Afterwards, the next mouse may be submitted to the test.8.  Repeat procedure until all mice have been tested.9.  Repeat procedure each day for 5 daily sessions.# Video 1. Demonstration of temporally dissociated passive avoidance procedure in miceNote: This video was recorded with the room lights on. Normally, room lights are turned off.()# Notes1.  Determining timing and intensity of shockIncreasing the time between entry into the dark chamber and foot shock and/or decreasing shock intensity can be used to achieve greater sensitivity for detection of mild  learning  impairments  (Figure  2).  For  instance,  if  a  robust  reduction  in hippocampal function resulting in an expected increase in crossover latency is hypothesized, a strong shock angle1.2m A and/or short time before shock (30 sec) could be used to elicit maximal differences between groups. In contrast, if a mild reduction in hippocampal function is hypothesized, a moderate shock (0.4-0.8m A) and time before shock (5-10 m i n) ) could be used to detect a modest reduction in crossover latency, particularly  in  later  sessions.  Across  five  days  of  TDPA,  mild  impairment  in hippocampal function results in a rightward shift in the learning curve (Eagle et al., 2015). However, it should be expected that increasing time and decreasing intensity will also contribute to greater between-subject variability and across-trial variability. For extended (e.g., 5-day) learning, times ranging from 30 sec to 600 sec and intensity ranging between 0.4-1.2 mA are recommended. Other variables may also alter behavior, including time to criterion. While we provide suggested parameters, we strongly recommend conducting preliminary studies to address the needs of your own experiments.2.  Measurement/controlThe protocol we present is based on a manual setup. However, many hardware and software suppliers allow for alternative methods of measurement and testing control. Measurements can be achieved by automated video tracking or photobeam systems. Typical measurements consist of crossover latency across trials (Figure 2) and survival graph depicting the % of animals (per experimental condition) reaching criterion across trials. No behavior is recorded during the shock because the mouse is in an opaque dark chamber. Crossover latency to enter the dark side (from the light side) is the only behavior that is assessed.3.  Environment and other factorsIt is critical to control all aspects of the environment in order to achieve consistent, replicable results. Testing should always occur in a controlled environment with minimal extraneous sounds or visual and olfactory stimuli. This is best achieved by conducting testing in a quiet, dim room and may be further enhanced by placing the light-dark box in a sound attenuating cubicle. As circadian condition has been shown to affect learning and memory, we recommend that training and testing be performed with fixed time span for all sessions (e.g., _2-4h into light cycle to determine behavior in the inactive phase or ^2-4h into dark cycle for the active phase).4.  Animal considerationsIt is important to conduct preliminary studies in order to characterize the behavioral phenotype with particular equipment, environment, and animals. This is especially true in the case of varying mouse strains, either inbred or outbred, if mice have been surgically or behaviorally manipulated prior to TDPA testing, or for determining differences  in  juvenile  mice  or  sex  effects.  If  factors  such  as  genetic  or pharmacological alteration are involved, it is important to determine whether these factors affect sensitivity to foot shock and spontaneous behavior in the light-dark box. We recommend first running a 5-10 min light-dark box test to examine the number of transitions between the two chambers and the total time spent in the light chamber. In addition, some labs prefer to pre-handle mice for 5-7 days and singly house the animals prior to TDPA training/testing.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Equipment Setup\nClean the light-dark chamber with 70% ethanol/water solution on all surface areas and wipe clean.\nMake sure doorway between light side and dark side is closed.\nTurn on houselight.\nTurn on shocker and adjust for pre-determined shock intensity.\n## Mouse Placement and Acclimation\nPlace mouse in light chamber of the light-dark box.\nWait approximately 60 sec for mouse to acclimate to light side.\nEnsure the mouse is facing away from the door (at least 45°) and at least 5 cm from the door before opening the door.\n## Door Opening and Cross-Over Latency Measurement\nRaise the door separating the dark side from the light side of the light-dark box.\nStart the timer to measure cross-over latency, defined as the duration after door opens for mouse to enter the dark side of the light-dark box.\nStop the timer when the mouse enters the dark side of the chamber.\n## Post-Cross-Over Procedures\nOnce the mouse has crossed over, lower the door.\nAfter repeated trials, most non-experimental mice will reach criterion, typically consisting of 300-600 sec in the light side without any crossover.\nManually remove the mouse from the light side once it has reached criterion.\n## Foot-Shock Application\nAfter a specific amount of time in the dark side, apply a single foot-shock to the grid floor.\nThe amount of time and the shock intensity will determine (affect) cross-over latency in subsequent trials.\n## Post-Shock Procedures\nAllow the mouse to remain in the dark chamber for 30 sec after the foot shock to associate the environment with the aversive stimulus.\nRemove the mouse to its home cage.\n## Chamber Cleaning and Preparation for Next Mouse\nRemove all urine and fecal boli from both sides of the chamber.\nClean the chamber entirely with 70% ethanol to remove any residual smell from the first mouse.\n## Repeated Testing\nRepeat the procedure until all mice have been tested.\nRepeat the procedure each day for 5 daily sessions.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Neuroscience Methods"}}

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3348","title":"Procedure for Rhamnolipids Quantification Using Methylene-blue","text":"Procedure for Rhamnolipids Quantification Using Methylene-blue\n\n# Abstract\n\nRhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) represent a group of biosurfactants with various applications (e.g., bioremediation of oil spills, cosmetics, detergents  and  cleaners).  The  commonly  used  colorimetric  methods  for  rhamnolipid quantification, including anthrone, phenol−sulfuric acid and orcinol based quantification (Helbert  and  Brown,  1957;  Chandrasekaran  and  BeMiller,  1980),  are  laborious  and operationally hazardous because of the strong acid/chemical emanation which can cause deterioration  of  instruments  measurements  (e.g.,  spectrophotometer).  Therefore,  the methylene-blue-based analysis appears as a promising alternative to safely quantify whole rhamnolipid molecules based on chemical complexation reaction (Pinzon and Ju, 2009). Indeed, methylene blue and rhamnolipids form a complex in a water-chloroform phase system. The rhamnolipids-methylene blue complex is partitioned into the chloroform phase which will develop a blue color that can be quantified at 638 n m to deduce rhamnolipids concentration. Here, we describe a variant of methylene-blue-based rhamnolipids quantification procedure that allows spectrophotometric quantification on standard 96-well plastic microplate contrarily to original methylene blue procedure that requires specific and expensive microplate due to chloroform chemical properties.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  P. aeruginosa PAO1 culture and rhamnolipids extraction1.  P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown with agitation (175 rpm) at 37~^°C for 18h in a sterile culture tube ^14m l) containing 5ml LB-MOPS medium (initial A600 of the culture was between 0.020 and 0.025).2.  After incubation, culture of P. aeruginosa in mid-stationary phase was centrifuged(3,200× g,24^°C,5min) to obtain supernatant and pellet. 4ml of supernatant was filtered (0.1 um filters, 20 xg) to remove cells. Then, pH of cell-free supernatant was adjusted to 2.3pm0.2 using 1 N HCl (approx80~ul) .3.  Rhamnolipids were extracted by mixing 4ml of supernatant with 4ml of ethyl acetate. The non-miscible mixture was vigorously vortexed (600 r p m) for 20 sec and phase separation was realized by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at speed 100xg for 1 min.4.  The upper, rhamnolipid-containing organic/ethyl acetate phase was transferred to a new reaction tube (30 m) . Ethyl acetate phase should be carefully removed without taking any liquid from the top aqueous layer.5.  Extraction procedure was repeated three times and ethyl acetate extracts were combined in the reaction tube and evaporated to dryness in speedvac centrifugal evaporator (generally evaporated in 30 min at 200xg speed) and immediately quantified.B.  Rhamnolipids quantificationFormation of chloroform-methylene blue complex Dry rhamnolipid-extract was dissolved in 4 m l chloroform and mixed with 400~ul methylene blue solution (freshly prepared). Tubes were vigorously mixed by vortexing for 5 min, then incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min to allow for color formation. Note: The chloroform phase will develop a blue color, proportional to the concentration of rhamnolipids. Cover tubes with aluminum foil to minimize chloroform evaporation during incubation Figure 1(d).()Figure 1. Expected results during chemical complexation reaction step. (a).

Measurements stepOne ml of the chloroform (lower) phase was transferred in a clear microcentrifuge tube (2ml) and mixed by vortexing for 20 sec with 500~ul of H C l 0.2N . Phase separation was then realized by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at speed 100xg for 1 min and the solution was left at room temperature for 10 m i n to optimize methylene blue extraction in HCl. Finally, 200~ul of the upper acidic phase, containing a portion of the complexed  methylene  blue,  was  transferred  in  a  96-well  microplate  and  the absorbance was measured at 638n m with SpectraMax M2 device against an H C l0.2 N blank.# 3.  Rhamnolipids calibration curve generationRhamnolipids standard solution was prepared by dissolving 8 mg of rhamnolipids in 4 ml of chloroform. This solution is used to generate different concentration of rhamnolipids by dilution in chloroform (i.e. 12.5 ug/ml , 25 u/m l , 50 u/m l , 100 u/ m l and 200 u/m l) . For each concentration, formation of chloroform-methylene blue complex and measurements steps were carried out to generate calibration curve equation (Figure 2; Table 1).\n\n# Outline\n\n## P. aeruginosa PAO1 Culture\nGrow P. aeruginosa PAO1 with agitation (175 rpm) at 37°C for 18h in a sterile culture tube (14ml) containing 5ml LB-MOPS medium (initial A600 of the culture was between 0.020 and 0.025).\nCentrifuge the culture at 3,200×g, 24°C, 5min to obtain supernatant and pellet.\nFilter 4ml of supernatant (0.1um filters, 20xg) to remove cells and adjust the pH of the cell-free supernatant to 2.3±0.2 using 1N HCl (approximately 80~ul).\n## Rhamnolipids Extraction\nExtract rhamnolipids by mixing 4ml of supernatant with 4ml of ethyl acetate, vortexing (600rpm) for 20sec, and centrifuging at 100xg for 1min.\nTransfer the upper, rhamnolipid-containing organic/ethyl acetate phase to a new reaction tube (30ml), being careful not to take any liquid from the top aqueous layer.\nRepeat the extraction procedure three times, combining the ethyl acetate extracts in the reaction tube and evaporating to dryness in a speedvac centrifugal evaporator (generally evaporated in 30min at 200xg speed).\n## Rhamnolipids Quantification\n## Formation of Chloroform-Methylene Blue Complex\nDissolve dry rhamnolipid-extract in 4ml chloroform and mix with 400~ul methylene blue solution (freshly prepared).\nVortex the tubes for 5min, then incubate at ambient temperature for 15min to allow for color formation.\n## Measurements\nTransfer 1ml of the chloroform (lower) phase to a clear microcentrifuge tube (2ml) and mix with 500~ul of HCl 0.2N by vortexing for 20sec.\nCentrifuge at 100xg for 1min, leave at room temperature for 10min, and then transfer 200~ul of the upper acidic phase to a 96-well microplate.\nMeasure the absorbance at 638nm with a SpectraMax M2 device against an HCl 0.2N blank.\n## Rhamnolipids Calibration Curve Generation\nPrepare a rhamnolipids standard solution by dissolving 8mg of rhamnolipids in 4ml of chloroform.\nGenerate different concentrations of rhamnolipids (12.5ug/ml, 25ug/ml, 50ug/ml, 100ug/ml, and 200ug/ml) by dilution in chloroform.\nCarry out the formation of chloroform-methylene blue complex and measurements steps for each concentration to generate a calibration curve equation.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Biochemical & Molecular Functional Analysis"}}

Making 4% PPA solution: Dissolve 8.0  potassium pyroantimonate (PPA) in the 400 mM Na2HPO4 (p H7.6) ) by heating to 90-95 ^°C and with continuous agitation. Then after, filter the solution through a 0.22um Millipore filter, then keep it in 4^°C refrigerator before use (see Notes 1). b.  Making PPA staining fluid (50~ml) : Mix 25 ml 4% PPA solution with 6~ m l~25% Glutaraldehyde, then fill up with 19ml of sterile H_2O (see Notes 2).2.  Fixation and rinsing: Collect plant root tips that grown on 1/2 MS medium and rinse with distilled water several times, then cut rip tips with a scalpel in size of about ^2m m and quickly put it in cold PPA staining fluid in a 1.5 m l centrifuge tube. If the plant materials are floating, give a vacuum treatment (0.8 Mpa, 10 min) till the materials sink to the bottom of tube, fixation at 4^°C , overnight. Discard PPA staining fluid, by rinsing with 1% PPA solution for 3 times, each time for 5 min.3. Dehydration: Then after, dehydrate the fixed material in a graded cold acetone serials 30% , 50% , 70% , 90% , 100% , 100% ), and 15 min each time.4.  Penetration: After dehydration, treat the materials with a serial mixtures of Epon 812: pure acetone (1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) for 12 h each time; and pure Epon 812 mixture (35-40^°C) for 12h .5.  Embed: Add fresh Epon 812 mixture to clean 200~ul Eppendorf tube, transfer root tip carefully and organize the root tip and let it merged in the embedding mixture but not touch to wall of tube with a needle (Figure 1A). Then put the tubes in an incubator, 35 ^°C for 12~h , then 45^°C for 12~h and 60~^°C for 24~h , till the resin is well solidified.Cool down at room temperature for about 1 h.6.  Coat nickel grids: Coat nickel grids with formvar can be done by merging the grids in formvar solution for several second then dry on filter paper for about 1 to ^2h ; or put a drop of formvar solution directly on the nickel grids on a clean grass slide then let it dry down naturally, it takes about 2 h.7.  Sectioning: After trimming the embedded block with a sharp knife (or a block trimmer) properly, cut the block with an ultra-cut microtome to generate 100 n m thick ultrathin sections and mounted onto 200-mesh formvar-coated nickel grids (Figure 1B). Dry under a lamp for about 1 h .8.  Microscopy: Check the samples with a transmission electron microscope. Calcium deposition shows black granules or aggregates (Figure 1C-D; Notes 3).()Figure 1.

Tissue digestion procedure1.  Endometrial biopsies should be transferred to a 15ml Falcon tube containing transfer medium in a chilled carrier (or in the presence of ice packs).2.  Endometrial tissues will remain stable at 4~^°C for ^24~h~ and do not need to be processed immediately.3.  Prepare a 15 ml Falcon tube with 5-7 ml 1x digestion media.4.  Transfer the tissue and media into a petri dish. Use forceps and scalpels to gently pull the endometrium away from the myometrium if utilizing a full tissue section. Discard the myometrium. Endometrial biopsies procured by pipelle endometrial suction curette are easy to dissect and should not require extensive force. Cut the tissues into 1~m m^3 pieces.5.  Observe by brightfield microscopy. When viewed with a 50x lens, endometrial blocks will look dark with visible glandular/luminal fragments embedded within. Epithelial fragments appear to have a shiny, worm/pearl-necklace-like morphology whilenon-epithelial tissue pieces appear as dark shapes. The epithelial fragments willappear as if they are “embedded” in these dark shapes. Single cells are also observable at this magnification.6.  Use a 2mvert-5mvert pipet to pull up the pieces and transfer to a new 15~ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 1-2 min to pellet the endometrial tissues and single cells, discard the supernatant, and resuspend in 510~ml 1x digestion media ( 10ml for larger, two-three pipelle pass biopsies).7.  Incubate on a rotator (10-20 rpm depending on the model) for 1-2h at 37^°C (a sterile incubator can be used for this). Gently shake the tube manually every 15 min to assist with digestion.8.  The digested material will now comprise mainly of single cells and epithelial fragments (which  is  composed  of  luminal  epithelial  sheets  and  glandular  epithelium). Compared to pre-digestion, they will now appear free floating and not “embedded” in the dark shapes. If non-digested tissue remains, carefully pipette out these fragments by transferring the digested matter into a petri dish. Continue to A9.9.  Pipette the digested matter into a 40 um cell strainer placed on top of an open 50~ml Falcon tube.10. The flow-through contains a heterogeneous mix of leukocytes, endometrial stem cells, and stromal fibroblasts.11. Figure 1 represents a schematic summary of the digestion and separation procedure.()Figure 1. The endometrial tissue digestion and cell plating procedure# B.  Culturing of primary eEC1.  Reverse-wash the filter into a petri dish with PBS by turning the filter upside down and using PBS to wash the retained materials off into the dish. The contents should contain luminal and glandular epithelial fragments.  Incubate the petri dish with 10ml of a 1:10 dilution of SCM in PBS. During this process, called selective attachment (Zhang et al., 1995; Kirk and Irwin, 1980; Kirk et al., 1978), eSF will attach to the plastic petri dish in the presence of serum, while epithelial fragments will not attach. Incubate for 1 h at 37~°0 . Under 50x magnification, it is possible to identify contaminating tissue pieces, and remove them by gentle aspiration using a pipette.2.  Collect epithelial fragments in a 15~ml Falcon conical tube using a serological pipette and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min to pellet epithelial fragments. Aspirate the 1:10 diluted SCM and wash the pellet two more times with 10ml of defined KSFM at 300~x~ g for 5 min to wash out remnants of FBS.3.  (Simultaneously with step B2) Add 500ul of KSFM to a 24-well Matrigel-coated plate to rehydrate the Matrigel. Incubate at room temperature and remove the medium after 30 min. Add 500ul of fresh KSFM to the wells.4.  Reconstitute the pellet in KSFM. For the average size endometrial pipelle biopsy (one uterine pass with the pipelle), 3 ml of KSFM is appropriate for the average epithelial yield. Mix the epithelial fragments with a pipette and add 250scriptscriptstyle-500~ul of medium containing epithelial fragments into each well. For the average size pipelle biopsy, there should be enough fragments to plate 6-12 wells. When viewing the epithelial fragments, it is optimal to have 5-10 fragments per viewing field per well at 50× magnification for a 24 well plate (Figure 2A).Copyright  2015 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.Note that it is important to mix the fragments after seeding each well since fragments will sediment quickly. Thus, we advise mixing of the bulk solution of fragments before pipetting into each well.()Figure 2. Bright field microscopy of endometrial cell populations. A. Epithelial sheets and fragments; B. Initial attachment of eEC onto Matrigel; C. eEC growing in island-shaped clusters; D. Confluent eEC monolayer with dome-shaped formations; E. eEC culture with eSF overgrowth; F. Confluent eSF. 50× magnification.5.  Glands will attach to Matrigel within 24~h (Figure 2B). Attached glands will spread out and grow into island-like clusters (Figure 2C). Eventually these cellular islands will form one major epithelial monolayer. Healthy eEC monolayer will become confluent in 5-10 days, and form dome-like structures (Figure 2D). These domes represent the eEC monolayer folding over each other.6.  The appearance of spindle-like cells likely represents eSF contamination. This type of eSF contamination is common when culturing cells of epithelial origins. Studies report that 1-5% contamination is common (Pierro et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2013), but this contamination does not usually affect the eEC monolayer. eSF in the presence of a low calcium environment such KSFM medium will eventually become non-viable and detach. However, there is the possibility that eSF will propagate even in sub-optimal conditions, and overtake the eEC culture (Figure 2E). These samples are unusable and should be discarded.7.  It is possible to passage the cultured cells once, but not more than that as eEC are reported to have limited expansion potential (Pierro et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). To passage eEC, remove the KSFM and incubate with Accutase ^(500u l. for a 24 well plate) at 37^°C for 20-30 min.Note that trypsin-based reagents may lower eEC viability and should be avoided. After eEC is detached, wash twice in KSFM (for ease of use, it is possible to pool all the wells of cells in Accutase into a 15 ml Falcon tube). Add equivalent volumes of KSFM.Spin again at 300~×~g to remove the supernatant. Resuspend the single-cell Copyright  2015 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC. 6 suspension in KSFM. The volume will vary based on the cell density. Plate 1 x 105 cells into each subsequent 24-well Matrigel-coated plates.C.  Culturing of Primary eSF1.  Centrifuge the filtered single-cell suspension at 300 x g for 5~m i n (from step A9) to remove digestion media. If necessary, the pellet can be treated with red blood cell lysis buffer for 1-2 min, centrifuged and then washed twice with PBS. More than two treatments with lysis buffer are not recommended. Note: It is not absolutely necessary to treat with lysis buffer, however blood and mucous may result in poor visualization of eSF cultures.2.  The pellet (containing mostly eSF, but also some leukocytes, stem cells, and endothelial cells) should then be resuspended in SCM then plated directly onto 10c m cell culture petri dishes. The use of SCM selects for eSF proliferation while disfavoring the survival of non-eSF cells. Plate 23×10^5 e S F into petri dishes, or 5×10^4 cells into a 24-well plate, depending on experimental goals. eSF confluency should be achieved within 5 days (Figure 2F).3.  eSF can be passaged using trypsin-based detaching reagents. Briefly, plated cells are washed once with PBS, and 0.25% trypsin is added for 5 min in the incubator to detach eSF.4.  After detachment with trypsin, neutralize the trypsin with equal volumes of SCM. Centrifuge at 300xg for 5 min and resuspend in SCM. The volume should be adjusted accordingly based on the viable cell count. eSF are now ready to be plated.5.  eSF can be routinely passaged up to passages 3-4. Note that it is possible to isolate other cell types from the digested single-cell matter through flow cytometric sorting as previously reported (Chen et al., 2014).# Troubleshooting1.  My eEC fragments are not attaching to Matrigel.a.  The Matrigel must be rehydrated before seeding of eEC.b. Increasing the seeding density (fragments per 50× viewing area) may help.c. Over-seeding of eEC fragments may also inhibit growth potential (adding too many fragments will prevent optimal attachment surface area, usually > 10 fragments per viewing area).d. Extend the incubation of eEC on Matrigel to 48 h before washing off non-attached cells.e.  Patient use of progestin based contraceptives or the presence of chronic inflammatory endometrial disorders may affect eEC growth potential.2.  My eEC culture is becoming contaminated with bacteria/yeast/fungus.a.  Adding gent or AB/AM at working concentrations to KSFM can reduce exogenous contamination.b.  Increasing the selective attachment incubation time or adding more SCM (1:5 dilution instead of 1:10) to the selective attachment plate since SCM contains antibiotics.3.  My eEC culture has become non-viable due to significant eSF overgrowth.a.  If a substantial number of free individual cells are observed immediately prior to pre-plating of eEC, perform an additional filtration step with a 40um cell strainer. b.  Increase the selective attachment incubation time.4.  My eSF culture has some residual eEC in the primary culture. Is that ok? a.  Some eEC fragments may not be filtered out and remain in the eSF culture. These eEC will undergo attrition in SCM media and become non-viable. b.  Additional passaging of eSF to P2 before experimentation will ensure a pure eSF population.# Recipes1.  2x digestion media Combine 156ml of HBSS w/M g^2+ and  C a^2+ to the collagenase I powder Add 3.12ml hyaluronidase ( 20k U total) Add 3 ml of Pen/Strep (18.8 nM working concentration) 6.4m g/m l collagenase type I 125U/mI hyaluronidase (final 2x concentration) Aliquot 5ml into 15ml Falcon tubes and freeze at -20~^°C for storage up to a year For the 1x working solution, dilute 1:1 in HBSS w/0Mg^2+ and  C a^2+ Note: If the tissue is large and a more concentrated digestion is desired, it is not necessary to dilute to 1x.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3515","title":"Bacterial Porphyrin Extraction and Quantification by LC/MS/MS Analysis","text":"Bacterial Porphyrin Extraction and Quantification by LC/MS/MS Analysis\n\n# Abstract\n\nHeme is an iron-containing porphyrin which acts as a prosthetic group in several enzymes  involved  in  disparate  functions,  such  as  respiration  and H_2O_2 -scavenging. Escherichia coli is able to produce heme endogenously since it contains all the enzymes involved in the nine-step biosynthesis pathway, which in absence of stress and in iron-replete media proceeds unabated. However, we recently showed that two steps are affected by H_2O_2 stress (Mancini and Imlay, 2015). To compensate, two enzymes, namely the ferrochelatase (HemH) and an isozyme of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF), are activated by the H_2O_2 -responsive regulator OxyR. Genetic mutations that block either adaptation cause the intracellular accumulation of protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrinogen III, the substrates of HemH and HemF, respectively. We here describe a method used to extract and quantify protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin III, the product of the spontaneous oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3597","title":"Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis of Cell Wall Structural Glycoproteins in vitro","text":"Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis of Cell Wall Structural Glycoproteins in vitro\n\n# Abstract\n\nHydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are major protein components in dicot primary cell walls and generally account for more than 10% of the wall dry weight. As essential members of the HRGP superfamily, extensins (EXTs) presumably function in the cell wall by assembling into positively charged protein scaffolds (Cannon et al., 2008) that direct the proper deposition of other wall polysaccharides, especially pectins, to ensure correct cell wall assembly (Hall and Cannon, 2002; Lamport et al., 2011a). Extensins are recalcitrant to purification as they are rapidly cross-linked into a covalent network after entering the cell wall but there exists a short time window in which newly synthesized extensin monomers can be extracted (Smith et al., 1984; Smith et al., 1986) by salt elution. A detailed protocol for extraction of extensin and other wall structural proteins has been described earlier (Lamport et al., 2011b). The protocol elaborated here provides an approach to studying the self-assembly of extensins and potentially of other cell wall components in vitro using AFM.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Filter ddH2O through 0.2um syringe filter into clean glass vials before use. b.  Prepare 50 mM NaOAc buffer (p H5.2) . Filter buffer through 0.2um syringe filter into clean glass vials before use.2.  Prepare protein stock solutions Dissolve protein samples to a concentration of 1m g/m l in filtered buffer as stock solutions using 1.5ml Eppendorf Protein LoBind Tube (see Note 1). Aliquot stock solutions into 100ul fractions (see Note 2). Store stock aliquots at -20~^°C before use.3.  Preparation of imaging “substrate” (see Note 3) Clean one glass slide with ddH2O followed by rinsing with 75% ethanol. Air dry theslide and apply the Loctite® Epoxy instant mix glue to the center of the slide. After a quick mix of the two glue components, carefully remove the HOPG from its case using tweezers and place it on top of the glue. Allow overnight incubation for the tight binding of HOPG to the slide.B.  Sample preparation for AFM imagingPrepare diluted protein samples Dilute protein stocks to desired concentration (see Note 4) with corresponding buffer or ddH2O using Eppendorf Protein LoBind Tubes (see Note 1), mix the dilutes by gentle vortexing and then spin down the protein solutions at 3,000× g for 2 min.2.  Substrate preparation HOPG has multiple layers and each layer is atomically flat. Carry out each AFM experiment on a fresh layer. To obtain a new layer of HOPG, simply use Scotch tape to adhere to the previous surface and peel off the old surface. Note that sometimes multiple attempts are required to achieve a visually flat HOPG surface (see Note 5).3.  Protein binding to HOPG After obtaining the fresh HOPG surface, place the glass slide with HOPG in a petri dish and deposit 100ul of protein solution onto the center of the HOPG surface. Cover the petri dish with lid to prevent unnecessary contamination from the surrounding environment. Place moist Kimwipes in the petri dish (avoid direct contact with HOPG) if long incubation time (more than 30m i n ) is needed to reduce sample evaporation. Allow the protein solution to incubate on HOPG for one minute or longer (see Note 6) at room temperature. Following incubation, use Kimwipes (see Note 7) to blot away the protein solution and rinse the HOPG surface with 100~ul ddH2O. Blot away the remaining liquid and dry the surface further under a slow steam of N_2 gas flow for 2 min. At this point, the sample preparation is complete and the HOPG surface is ready for AFM scanning.C.  AFM imaging of the self-assembly of extensinsRefer to the user’s manual (http://mmrc.caltech.edu/Asylum/Asylum%20MRP-3D%20manual.pdf) from Asylum Research for the operation of the MFP-3D SA AFM. Use “AC mode” (Chapter 6 in the manual, pp 121-142) for the scanning of samples in air. The probe we used was a NCS18 silicon probe from Mikromasch (see Materials and Reagents). For better resolution, Hi'Res-C14 probes (catalog number: Hi'Res-C14/Cr-Au-5) are recommended because of their finer tip radius (1n m) .After probe installation, optical detection laser alignment and probe tuning, on the master panel (see pp136 in the manual), select the initial scan parameters as follows:Scan S i z e=5.00umScan Rate =0.75H z (see Note 8)Scan Points/Lines = 256Set Point =800.00 mv Integral Gain =4 (see Note 9)Engage the AFM probe to sample surface by lowering the AFM head and start scanning. Here note that the “Drive Amplitude/Frequency” values on the master panel are the values automatically filled in by the instrument upon the finishing of probe tuning, thus no changes of these values are needed.After the start of scanning, first allow the system to scan for 2 min to stabilize the probe and adjust the instrument to surrounding environmental vibrations. Then manually lower the “Set Point” value until surface features start to appear on the height image. Imaging optimization can be achieved by adjusting “Set Point” and “Integral Gain” values. Finally, the “Scan Points” and “Scan Lines” can be increased to 512 or even 1,024 (see Note 10) for more pixels in each image thus enhance the image quality.For the determination of self-assembly pattern, take at least five images at five different locations on the HOPG surface for each sample.# D. Image processingImages need to be flattened using the “flatten” function in IGOR Pro software before any measurements. Information of height (i.e., the diameter) and length of a molecule can be directly measured on the images using the IGOR Pro software. The default color setting of the images is grey but IGOR Pro has a variety of built-in color schemes that can be used to false-color images afterwards. In the meantime, the contrast and brightness of each image can also be adjusted for a better presentation of the image.()Representative dataFigure 1. Images of extensin self-assembly. (a) Monomeric extensin precursor 1 from tomato suspension culture (TOMP1). (b) Extensin analog YK8. (c) Extensin analog FK9. (d) BSA used as a control. YK8 and FK9 are extensin analogs that contain 8 repeats of SOOOOSOSOOOOYYYK and 9 repeats of SOOOOSOSOOOOFFFK in their protein sequences, respectively, and are purified from tobacco BY2 cells in culture (Held et al., 2004). One letter amino acids codes: Tyrosine (Y), Lysine (K), Phenylalanine (F), Serine (S), Hydroxyproline (O). All proteins were imaged at 10 u/m l in pH 5.2 NaOAc buffer, following deposition for 1 min. The white scale bar: 500~n m . TOMP1 and the extensin analogs all showed a head to tail dendritic self-assembly similar to that of EXTENSIN 3 from Arabidopsis (Cannon et al., 2008), while BSA showed no such assembly but only protein aggregation. Red arrow in image (d) indicates the scattered single sphere shaped BSA molecules.()Figure 2. Concentration and deposition time dependent self-assembly of TOMP1 in pH 5.2 NaOAc buffer. a. TOMP1 showed head to tail dendritic self-assembly after 10 min deposition on HOPG at 5ug/ml . b. At a higher concentration 10u/m l TOMP1 assembled into a porous network in the same time period, indicating the extent of self-assembly is concentration dependent. c. Similar assembly of TOMP1 as in (a), highlighted by the white circles, was observed when 10 u/m l of TOMP1 was deposited for 1 min, indicating that the extent of TOMP1 self-assembly also followed a time dependent manner. Examples of measurements for TOMP1 self-assembly: (1) The average segment length, highlighted by white bars in the circles in image (c), is 78.2pm4.2 nm this is in agreement with previously electron microscopy measurements of the TOMP1 polypeptide length at about 79 nm (Heckman et al., 1988). This observation indicates one TOMP1 molecule occurs in each segment. (2) The average single molecule height, highlighted by red bars in image (c), is ^2.7pm 0.2 n m . This value corresponds to the diameter of single TOMP1 molecule. (3) The average height of the connecting points for three molecules, highlighted by green circles in image (c), is 5.2pm0.2 nm. This value indicates that the TOMP1 molecules form lateral and overlapping associations up to two molecules deep. The white scale bar: 500 nm# Notes1.  The protein concentrations used in stock and imaging are relatively low. The use of Eppendorf Protein LoBind tubes will prevent non-specific binding of protein to the tubes thus resulting in a more accurate protein amount used in experiments.2.  Repeated  freezing-thawing  will  lead  to  protein  degradation  and  unexpected aggregation. Use one aliquot per experiment to help prevent such damage to the protein stocks.3.  In AFM imaging, the surface on which sample solutions are deposited is called “substrate”. We used HOPG for imaging of proteins due to its hydrophobicity, which allows the stable binding of proteins to the surface. To study other wall components, for instance wall polysaccharides and cell wall itself, other substrates such as mica (for polysaccharides) or charged glass slides (for cell wall) can be used as alternatives to ensure the binding of sample to the substrate surface.4.  Depending on the purpose of the experiments, various protein concentrations can be used. From our experience, a low protein concentration (5 or 10 u/m l) ) will benefit in the observation of extensin single molecular assembly while a higher concentration (50u/ml) will result in an orderly formed network.5.  HOPG will get thinner after multiple uses, thus making it progressively more difficult to obtain a new visually flat surface. Based on its original height dimension ^1 m m) , a replacement is recommended when the HOPG reaches less than 0.4m m in height.6.  Similar to Note 4, the length of incubation time also determines the pattern of observed self-assembly. Usually after longer incubation, a well-formed extensin network is observed. From our experience, the attachment of extensin molecules to the HOPG surface happens quickly. Incubation time as short as 1 min is sufficient for the binding of extensins to HOPG.7.  The use of regular paper towels is not recommended since there might be unexpected fibers or debris that might contaminate the sample surface.8.  Use a slow scan rate at first to protect the probe, the “Scan Speed” is automatically set upon the selection of “Scan Rate”.9.  Use a low “Integral Gain” in the beginning to protect the probe. This value can be elevated in a later scan for better image quality.10. “Scan Points” and “Scan Lines” determine the number of pixel point on each line and the number of lines scanned in the image, in most of the cases these two values should be kept the same.# Recipes1.  50 mM NaOAc buffer 0.41 g NaOAc100 ml distilled waterAdjust pH to 5.2 with HOAc2. 75% ethanolAdd 25ml water to 75ml 100% ethanol to make 100ml 75% ethanol# AcknowledgementsThis protocol was adapted with modification from Cannon et al.

This method is straightforward, efficient and cost-effective, and can be used both for vector creation and for subsequent one-step, high frequency integration into a chromosomal locus in yeast. The procedure utilizes PCR with extended oligonucleotide “tails” of homology between multiple fragments to allow for reassembly in yeast in a single transformation followed by a method for highly efficient plasmid extraction from yeast (for transformation into bacteria). The latter is an improvement on existing methods of yeast plasmid extraction, which, historically, has been a limiting step in recovery of desired constructs. We describe the utility and convenience of our techniques, and provide several examples.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

PCR machine (MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier Thermo Cycler, dual 30-well alpha blocks)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n1.  To begin, oligonucleotides are designed that allow for the amplification of each of the necessary gene fragment(s), epitope or fluorescent protein tags, nutritional markers, and/or drug-resistance cassettes and their recombinational assembly in the desired order (Figure 1B). The latter objective is achieved by \"tails\" of homology (typically 30 nucleotides (Baudin et al., 1993) on each primer that permit the joining of each amplified fragment to its neighbors by HR. Overlap sequences of 30 nucleotides in the 5^ -tail on the N-terminal-most fragment and in the 3'-tail of the C-terminal-most fragment with the corresponding flanking sequences in the plasmid DNA also suffice for recombinational insertion into the vector.2.  The desired fragment sequences can be amplified using as the template either genomic or plasmid DNA (see step 3) as a template. For purified plasmid DNA from most commercial kits (see Materials and Reagents), less than 0.25~ul is required as template DNA; for chromosomal DNA, approximately 23~ul is recommended per 50 μL PCR reaction using standard genomic DNA preparations from yeast (Amberg et al., 2006). We have found that optimal production of PCR fragments with overhanging tails is achieved using a two-phase PCR procedure: 5 cycles at a lower annealing temperature, followed by 25 cycles at a higher annealing temperature. To determine the initial temp., the T_m(i n^°C) for the non-overhanging portion of each of the two primers is determined (for this purpose, we use an algorithm available on-line (http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html)  and  the  recommended initial annealing temperature is determined from the formula (T_m^t o r w a r d+T_m^r e v e r s e)/2- 5. To determine the second temp., Tm's for each of the full primers are determined and the same formula applied. Depending on the DNA polymerase, the sequences being amplified, the thermocycler, and even the tubes used, the PCR reactions may need to be optimized. The critical point is that a single clean PCR product of the expected length needs to be generated. Hence, a sample of the resulting PCR product should be examined on a DNA agarose gel to ensure (i) a product of the correct size was created and (ii) there are not multiple DNA bands corresponding to mispriming.3.  If any sequence amplification used as the template a yeast-based plasmid propagated in E. coli, subsequent digestion with DpnI (New England Biolabs) allows for destruction of the methylated template DNA and virtually eliminates the recovery of potential false positives in those cases where a marker being selected in the constructed vector of interest is the same as that contained in the template DNA. Digestion with DpnI is performed at 37~^°C overnight (no heat-inactivation required) directly in the PCR tube mixture (no buffer required).4.  The desired yeast vector of interest (Figure 1B) should be digested with a single unique restriction endonuclease; this site should be downstream of any inserted fragment that is already present in the vector. One strategy includes cloning beforehand a promoter sequence (5’-UTR) into the desired yeast-based plasmid (we prefer CEN vectors).5.  Digestion of the resulting vector on the acute° -end of the promoter should be performed using an appropriate restriction enzyme and incubated overnight.Note: This digested product does not have to be extracted or gel purified because even uncut vector will not yield any false positives whenever the marker for selection of the desired construct (e.g., hygromycin-resistance) is distinct from any marker in the parent plasmid (e.g., URA3) (however, nonetheless, it might be prudent to ensure that the plasmid has indeed been linearized by running a small sample on an agarose gel).6.  A yeast strain that results in efficient assembly and subsequent high yield of the desired plasmid DNA is SF838-1Dα (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,122 his4-519 ade6 pep4-3 gal2) (Rothman and Stevens, 1986). However, for construction of plasmids in which HIS3 will be the selected marker (and not hygromycin-resistance), a derivative THS4218 (SF838-1Dα HIS4 his3Δ::HygR) is available. We have found that isolation of plasmids from strains of this background reproducibly results in higher plasmid yields and is more reliable than from other laboratory strains, including BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ ura3Δ met15Δ his3Δ) and its derivatives (Brachmann et al., 1998), especially when combined with ultra-chemically competent TOP10 bacterial transformation (see below).7.  The yeast should be grown overnight to saturation in rich (YPD) medium at 30~^°C , back-diluted to A_600n m0.25 in 10 m of YPD and grown at 30~^°C with shaking for roughly 4-5 h until A_600n m1 . For each plasmid construction by this in vivo ligation procedure,  a 10 m culture  of  yeast  is  required.  Hence,  if  multiple  plasmid constructions are to be done in parallel, then commensurately more culture will be needed.8.  Yeast should be collected by sedimentation in a clinical centrifuge for 5 min at 6,000 rpm and the YPD medium poured off. Resuspend the resulting pellet in 500~ul of sterile water with gentle pipetting and sediment again in a microfuge for 1 min at 6,000 rpm.9.  For yeast transformation, a modified lithium acetate-based high-efficiency protocol should be used (Eckert-Boulet et al., 2012). For this purposed, remove the water with a pipet and resuspend the yeast pellet in 500~ul of sterile 100m M lithium acetate solution and re-collect the cells for 1 min at 6,000 rpm and remove the supernatant solution and keep the yeast pellet.10. To each yeast pellet, add the following to the tube: 240~ul of 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG; autoclaved and sterile), 36~ul of sterile 1 M lithium acetate, 50~ul of 10 m g/ m l single-stranded salmon sperm DNA (ssDNA in water). A high amount of ssDNA is included to (i) serve as an efficient carrier of the transformed DNA and (ii) the ssDNA is extremely viscous (and can clump into globs that resist transferring via micropipette) at concentrations of 10 m g/ m l and therefore, a significant amount is lost in pipetting the solution into each tube (or a master mix solution). Therefore, to ensure that adequate ssDNA is included, we suggest the approximate amount of 50~ul with the understanding that some amount will be lost in solution preparation. Ingredients should be added in this order with the PEG solution added to the yeast first.Alternatively, should multiple transformations be performed at the same time, a “master mix” of the PEG, lithium acetate, and ssDNA can be mixed together and vortexed vigorously for 30 sec prior to adding to each yeast pellet. Two aspects of these reagents are important. First, the stock of salmon sperm DNA should be boiled for 10 min and cooled on ice for 10 min every time that it is used. Second, if the \"master mix\" is used, it must be made fresh for each experiment (it cannot be stored and reused).11. Add the appropriate DNA fragments (15-20 μl from each PCR reaction; the concentration will be dependent on the efficiency of the PCR reaction the length of the fragment, but generally this corresponds to roughly 3-5~ug of each PCR reaction) and cleaved vector ( 15-20~ul from the restriction enzyme digest; and approximately 2 u total DNA content depending on the size of the parent vector being used) to the tube of lithium acetate- and PEG-treated yeast. Vortex the tube for 30 sec at maximum speed to resuspend the yeast into solution and incubate at exactly 42^°C for 45min .12. Collect the yeast for 1 min at 6,000 rpm in a microfuge, remove the supernatant solution, and gently resuspend the yeast pellet in 550~ul sterile YPD medium and incubate overnight standing in a rack in a 30~^°C incubator. This overnight incubation step is absolutely required for any constructs using a drug-resistance cassette (K a n^R) NatR or HygR); yeast require a sufficient amount of time to express the drug-resistance cassette and become resistant before they are challenged with the drug present in the selection medium. Standing overnight incubation, as opposed to aeration by shaking or rotation, allows for slow and largely anaerobic growth reducing the rate of production of C O_2 and other volatiles, which, in our experience, can pop the lids off of standard Eppendorf tubes.13. Plate the full tube of yeast on the appropriate agar medium Y P D+d r u g , or synthetic drop-out medium), and incubate the plates for at least two days at 30~^°C . Optional controls include transforming the same yeast strains with (i) only digested vector and/or (ii) only each PCR fragment-both of these should result in no plasmid constructs being generated and no growth on the selection plates.14. For recovery of plasmid DNA, scrape yeast off the plate (avoid agar)-use at least 25% of the surface area of the entire Petri dish ( 150mm diameter dish; assuming there is a full lawn of coverage). Ideally, this high-efficiency in vivo ligation technique coupled with the high-efficiency yeast transformation should result in a complete lawn on the selective medium, although other factors (such as the complexity of the assembly) can reduce the final colony count. It is advised to only proceed with the protocol with constructs that resulted in ample coverage on the selection plate. If there are only single colonies on the initial selection plate, it is recommended to collect all of them and replate onto a fresh (selective) plate to grow up a sufficiently dense lawn of yeast for use in this protocol.15. The yeast scraped from the plate are resuspended in 500~ul of 1 M sorbitol, 0.1 MNa2EDTA (pH 7.5) (Amberg et al., 2006), briefly vortexed (maximum speed) to ensure full resuspension (expect that the solution will be very thick and concentrated), and then 57.5~ul of a stock (final concentration of 25mg/ml in 50% glycerol) of Zymolyase 100T (stored at 4^°C ) is added. After incubation at 37^°C on rotator for at least 1 h (but not more than 2 h), the resulting spheroplasts are collected at 12,000 rpm in a microfuge.16. After removal of the supernatant solution, the spheroplast pellet is resuspended in 250 ul of the proprietary bacterial plasmid isolation solution (see Materials and Reagents). Triturate by drawing the solution in and out of a pipet; at this point, the solution of lysed spheroplasts is extremely viscous and it takes significant effort to ensure very thorough resuspension.17. Add a roughly equal volume (roughly 100-250~ul) ) of glass beads .0.5m m diameter). Briefly spin in microfuge at 2,000 rpm for 5 sec (to ensure all glass beads are mixed with the yeast solution rather than stuck to the walls of the tube). Vortex on maximum for 5 min (if you are doing multiple constructions in parallel, a vortexing adaptor that can house multiple tubes at once can be used).18. After completion of lysis by the glass bead breakage, proceed with the subsequent steps of your preferred commercial bacterial plasmid isolation protocol- for the Thermo Scientific system, add 250~ul of “Lysis buffer” and mix by inversion at least 10 times = and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 350~ul of “Neutralization buffer” and mix by inversion at least 10 times immediately. Subject the resulting solution to centrifugation at maximum (13,200 rpm) in microfuge for 5 min.19. Transfer by pipetting the supernatant DNA-containing solution into a fresh, labeled tube and centrifuge at maximum speed for an additional 2 min (to remove any residual precipitate/cell debris). Transfer by pipetting the clarified supernatant solution into the plasmid-capturing spin column provided in the commercial bacterial plasmid isolation kit (see Materials and Reagents), centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min and discard the flow-through.20. Wash the spin column with the commercial ethanol wash solution (500-750 μl), centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min, and discard flow-through. Repeat (although this second wash step varies with the commercial plasmid prep kits and may be optional).21. To remove any residual wash solution, place the empty spin column in the microfuge and spin at maximum speed for 1 min, then place the spin column in a fresh Eppendorf tube and elute the bound DNA in the spin column by adding 25-30~ul of the “elution buffer” provided by the commercial supplier, incubating 1-2 min at room temperature, and then collecting the eluate by centrifugation at maximum speed for 2 min.22. To recover the desired constructed plasmid, a sample (10~ul) of the DNA-containing solution eluted from the spin column is gently mixed in a tube containing 100~ul of ultrachemically competent TOP10 bacterial cells (Materials and Reagents) that was taken from the -80~^°C freezer and thawed on ice for ten minutes. After combining the DNA with the competent cells, the solution was left on ice for another ten min, then placed in a 42^°C water bath for 40 sec to subject the cells to a heat shock, returned to ice for two additional min, mixed with 500ul of sterile SOC medium, and incubated on a rotator at 37^°C for 1~h~ .23. The resulting bacterial transformants (50-100~uK of the bacterial culture in SOC medium) are plated onto appropriate LB ^+ drug (typically ampicillin or kanamycin) plates (prewarmed at 37 ^°C_. ) and incubated at 37~^°C overnight. Typically, 100-500 single colonies per plate grow out. Plasmid DNA from several representative single colonies are then isolated by standard molecular biology methods and tested using diagnostic PCR and DNA sequencing to ensure that the assembled gene fragments are all present and do not harbor any mutations or other alterations. This overall in vivo ligation process is so incredibly robust and efficient, it usually only requires 1-2 colonies to be analyzed to obtain the desired construct (see Notes).24. Important advice for avoiding pitfalls: Application of the above procedures for a multitude of different constructs (n>1,000) over many years (a decade) indicates that the most common cause of any difficulty in successfully obtaining the desired constructs arises from the degree of sequence impurity in commercially purchased synthetic oligonucleotides. We have found that when mutations are observed, they reside in the junctions between gene fragments that correspond directly to the primer sequences  used  in  the  initial  PCR  amplifications.  Thus,  ensuring  the  high purity/quality/homogeneity of the initial oligonucleotide primers is critically important for maximizing the efficiency of this method of DNA assembly.# NotesOur system includes a number of important differences from a previous description (Andersen, 2011) of this general approach for HR-driven fragment assembly and plasmid construction in yeast.1.  Our methodology for plasmid creation takes advantage of the incorporation of a PCR fragment that contains a selectable marker (auxotrophic or drug-resistance cassette) that is distinct from any which may reside on any of the template DNAs used or on the parent vector into which the construct will be inserted (Figure 1B). In this way, even if the vector recircularizes, it will not generate any false positives when the selection is imposed to isolate clones carrying the desired construct.2.  Whenever it is unavoidable that the template and the vector have the same selectable marker, in our procedure false positives can still be efficiently eliminated by treatment of the PCR reaction products with DpnI restriction enzyme before their incorporation into the vector.3.  Our method eliminates the use of phenol: chloroform in the yeast plasmid isolation step.4.  Use of a unique lineage of S. cerevisiae strains (SF838-1Dα-based) allows for more efficient plasmid rescue from yeast.5.  Our approach allows for the insertion at any location of any desired sequence wherever it may have utility for meeting any experimental goal. Such sequences could include, but are not limited to, at the protein level, internal epitope tags, protease cleavage sites, aptamers for protein recognition domains, flexible linkers, and subcellular localization signals and, at the nucleic level, restriction endonuclease cut sites, stem-loop sequences for RNA-binding proteins, loxP cassettes, etc. (Figure 1C).6.  Our approach exploits and highlights the power of in vivo HR to yield complex multi-part gene fusions, domain deletions, or tagged constructs in a single assembly step. Prior to our methods, this approach had only been used as a means to simply clone by reassembly a large contiguous stretch of the yeast genome (Andersen, 2011).7.  Routinely, even for plasmids constructed from 5 or more separate PCR fragments (with a final plasmid size of 7-15×6 ), only 1-2 bacterial clones need to be examined to obtain the construct of interest. Overall, the process of in vivo ligation and plasmid recovery described here is an efficient, cost-effective means for accurately generating complex DNA assemblies and can be applied in a massively parallel manner, when needed, to generate hundreds of plasmid constructs simultaneously.8.  Finally, because a selectable marker is incorporated into each construct, it can be amplified (or excised) from the vector containing it and used for one-step gene replacement (Rothstein, 1991) in any desired recipient organism, such as the yeast KanR-marked haploid or diploid genome deletion collections (Brachmann et al., 1998) (Figure 1D).()Figure  1.  Complex  DNA  assembly  using  in  vivo  ligation  by  homologous recombination in yeast. A. A diagram illustrating the workflow of the protocol to construct plasmids using homologous recombination in yeast. B. An example construct is illustrated using homologous overlapping primer tails (identical colors show homology and the dotted lines illustrate the resulting recombination event across the homologous segments). Digested CEN-based yeast vector, such as LEU2-based pRS315 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989). This illustration represents a single example of a series of gene fragments assembled into a single construct in one step using in vivo ligation. Modifications to this arrangement can be used to assemble multiple domains within a single gene or genes, include multiple epitope or fluorescent tags at either the N- or C-termini, and/or include flanking UTR sequences for subsequent integration at a non-native chromosomal locus. C. This example specifically addresses a useful property of this process. Specifically, one can encode in the homologous overlapping tails between two adjacent gene fragments to be assembled any desired non-native sequence information to introduce additional sequences of interest (such as, but not limited to, an epitope tag, a Gly-Ser rich linker sequence, restriction enzyme cut sites, protein cleavage motifs, signal sequences, etc.). D. Following construction, the entire construct can be PCR-amplified and integrated into the genome in a single step using either designed homology ( \"5\". and acute° -UTR) within the system or, in the case of the MX-4-based drug-resistance cassette system devised by Goldstein and McCusker (2001), homology between the common sequence (blue) installed downstream of each type of drug-resistance gene, in which A D H1(t) is the terminator sequence from the ADH1 locus. Replacement of the gene deletion cassette with the modified gene of interest also allows for a swap in the growth selection markers (either drug resistance or nutrient). This system can also be modified to accommodate essential genes, as long as the recipient cell also harbors a URA3-based vector expressing the WT essential gene from a second plasmid, which can be subsequently eliminated by counter-selection on 5-FOA medium (Boeke et al., 1984).# Recipes1.  1 M sorbitol, 0.1 M Na2EDTA Adjusted to pH 7.5, filter sterilized2.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3657","title":"Genome-Wide siRNA Screen for Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance in Adherent Cell Lines","text":"Genome-Wide siRNA Screen for Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance in Adherent Cell Lines\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe expression of genes is frequently manipulated in cell lines to study their cellular functions. The use of exogenous small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a very efficient technique to temporarily downregulate the expression of genes of interest reviewed by Hannon and Rossi (2004). A genome-wide siRNA library allows the user to study both the effect of each individual gene on a particular cell phenotype in a high throughput manner and also assess its phenotypic effect relative to all other genes targeted. Several factors that potentially influence the outcome of a screen need to be considered when performing a large siRNA screen (Jiang et al., 2011). Here we present a detailed protocol for a genome-wide screen to identify genes involved in anti-cancer drug resistance using the human siGENOME library from Dharmacon. In this protocol, we focus on resistance to treatment with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) erlotinib in the lung cancer cell line PC9, which is exquisitely sensitive to EGFR-TKIs (de Bruin et al., 2014). This protocol can be used for other cell lines and other drug treatments, as we expand in the Notes below.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

These include:\n\n1.  Optimization of the siRNA transfection: Reagent, cell number, siRNA concentration. 2.  Optimization of the drug dose, treatment time length in combination with the siRNA transfection for drug resistant/sensitizing screens.\n\nDetails of these optimization steps are provided in the Notes section at the end of this protocol. We recommend performing, if possible, a pilot screen with a range of random siRNAs and selected control RNAs to determine the feasibility and screen read-out prior to the genome-wide screen.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nA.  siRNA reverse transfection1.  Culture PC-9 cells in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin.2.  Resuspend the siRNA SMARTpools library in 1x siRNA buffer (dilute the 5x siRNA buffer using RNase/DNase-free water) to reach a final concentration of 375 nM. Note: Upon arrival, the library was resuspended using 1x siRNA buffer into 3.75 µM stock solutions and stored at -20~^°C for long-term storage. At this step in the protocol, the stock library was further diluted into 375 nM.3.  Aliquot the siRNA SMARTpools from library assay plates using the BiomekFX into384-well assay plates at a final concentration of 11 nM/well (load 2.5 ul/w e l l_rho . Prepare all plates in triplicate for both the untreated and the drug-treated conditions. Use the first 4 columns of each plate for positive and negative siRNA controls (Figure 2 and Note 2), which can be aliquoted at the same time of the library or on the day of the transfection.Note: The plates can be prepared beforehand, sealed and stored at -20nabla^°C_s making()drugs added to columns 3-24 in treated conditionsFigure 2. Example of a layout of a 384-well plate. The first four columns were used for control siRNAs, with each row containing the siRNA indicated on the left. The first two columns were left untreated in the drug-treated conditions to confirm the effect of the drug. The remaining twenty columns were used for the genome-wide library, each well containing a different siRNA.4.  On the day of the reverse transfection, thaw the plates at RT for 20 m i n , and spin briefly for 1 min at 1,000 rpm (180xg) before removing the seal. Add the siRNA controls in the first 4 columns if not done so at step A3.5.  Dilute DharmaFECT2 in Opti-MEM media (see Notes 2-4; we used 0.075 µl DharmaFECT2/3 µl) and add 3ul per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed. Tap the plates to ensure the solutions mix well, and incubate the plates at RT for 15min .6.  In the meantime, trypsinize and count the PC9 cells in quadruplicate using the Countess cell counter, and dilute the cell suspension appropriately. For PC9 cells, the final cell number was 500 cells per well in 80~ul . We therefore prepared 15 L RPMI (with FCS and Pen/Strep) containing 93.75E06 cells (see Note 5) for a total of 402 384-well plates, which are 6 replicates of the genome siRNA library (201 plates for the untreated condition and 201 plates for the drug-treated condition).7.  Add 80~ul cell suspension per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed. Note: For an optimal reverse transfection, cells should be added to the siRNA mix at least 15 min and no more than 45 min after step A4.8.  Incubate cells in incubator at 37^°C for 48h in a Cytomat incubator to ensure efficientprotein knockdown.# B.  Drug treatment9.  Remove the medium using the Biotek PlateWasher (Figure 1); ensure that viable cells remain attached to the bottom of the wells.10. Add 80ul RMPI (supplemented with FBS and Pen/Strep) per well with or without drug (see Note 6) using Xrd-384 dispenser at medium speed. Note: For the treated condition, we left the first two columns containing control siRNAs without drug to determine the killing efficiency of the drugs in the experiment (Figure2).11. Incubate cells for a further 96 h (see Note 6).# C.  Cell number quantification12. Remove media.13. Fix the cells by adding 90~ul of 80% ice-cold EtOH using Xrd-384 dispenser at low speed. Store plates for at least 1 h at -20^°C . Note: Overnight storage at -20~^°C is perfectly fine and provides a suitable stopping point in the protocol.14. Perform steps C15-18 in batches of 50 plates.15. Wash the plates 3× with 100ul PBS using plate washer.16. Add 20ul of a 1 ug/m/ DAPI solution to each well and incubate the cells at RT for 1 h.17. Wash the plates with PBS using the plate washer.18. Seal the plates with adhesive foil seals. Note: Plates can be stored at 4^°C prior to quantification.19. Scan the plates using Acumen with the 405 nm laser to quantify the number of cells in each plate (see Note 7 and Figure 3).()Figure 3. Example of Acumen output of a plate in untreated conditions. A. Once a plate has been scanned by Acumen using laser 405nm, the number of stained cells is indicated in shades of green for each well. Note that the first four columns contain control siRNAs (see Figure 2). B. Each well can be visualized individually within the Acumen software package. Here, two examples are presented; the left well representing a well comparable to positive control siRNAs, which indicates that the siRNA did not impact, cell viability (>5,000 cells), whereas the right well shows the effect of an siRNA that impacted on cell viability (<500 cells).# D.  Data Analysis1.  Normalize the data within each plate using a robust Z-score calculation (Birmingham et al., 2009). For each plate, determine the median value of all samples (exclude the first four rows containing controls iRNAs) and subtract this value from each individual well. Divide each well by the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the plate to obtain a robust Z-score for each well. For example, the median sample value within plate A was 1,000 cells with an MAD of 200. If well D10 contains 800 cells, the robust Z-score for well D10 in plate A would be (800-1,000) /200=-1 , which indicates that this well contains 1 deviation fewer cells than the median.Normalize the data across the plates, separately for the untreated and drug-treated conditions. Determine for each position a smoothed Z-score using the median and MAD at each well position across all plates, in a similar manner as in the previous step. As mentioned above, calculate the smoothed Z-scores separately for the untreated and the drug-treated conditions.2.  Plot the smoothed Z-scores from the drug-treated condition against those from the untreated  condition  for  each  replicate  (two  conditions  in  triplicate  gives  nine comparisons in total).3.  Determine the ‘line of best fit’ using linear regression.4.  Calculate the residual difference between each data point (drug treated versus untreated) as the perpendicular distance between each data point and the ‘line of best fit’. A residual difference <0 indicate siRNAs were the viability within the drug condition is lower than would be expected based on the untreated condition, whereas a residual difference >0 indicate siRNAs were the viability within the drug condition is higher than would be expected based on the untreated viability. Thus, siRNAs with a positive  residual  difference  indicate  genes  that  reduce  drug  sensitivity  upon knockdown of the gene.Note: The results our genome-wide siRNA screen using this protocol  are included in the original manuscript as Supplementary Tables (de Bruin et al., 2014).5.  For further validation, we selected siRNAs with a smoothed Z-score ≥ -2 in the untreated condition (no cell killing in the absence of the drug) and with a median residual difference 2 (desensitizing) or e-2 (sensitizing). As described (de Bruin et al, 2014), this selection of siRNAs was further validated by performing a deconvoluted siRNA screen using the Dharmacon Set of 4 Upgrade siGENOME siRNAs.# Notes1.  Positive and negative controls need to be determined for each cell line. For PC9 cells, we used siGENOME siRNAs targeting UBB (ubiquitin B) and siRNAs targeting PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1) as positive killing controls; siGENOME non-targeting siRNA2 (SC2), RISC-Free controlsiRNA (RF) and ON-Targetplusnon-targeting siRNA (ON-NT) were used as negative controls. In addition, we left two columns of control siRNAs untreated in the drug-treated plates and used these columns as treatment control (Figure 2).2.  Optimal transfection reagent should be determined for each cell line, and depending on forward or reverse transfection. We tested 23 different transfection reagents in a reverse transfection in a 96-well format, using 0.1 and 0.3~ul for each reagent. We used LaminA/C siRNA and quantified both cell number and LaminA/C intensity and the fraction of cells exhibiting LaminA/C staining below a set threshold after staining with an LaminA antibody to assess toxicity and knock-down efficiency for each reagent as described in Note 3.3.  Lamin A/C staining protocol using 96-well plates: Transfect cells as decribed above in steps A1-7, continue with steps C12-14. Then add 30~ul LaminA/C antibody 1:1,000 dilution in 3% BSA with PBS and incubate plates at RT for 1-2 h. Wash plates 3x with PBS and incubate plates with 30~ul Alexa Fluor488 donkey anti-mouse (1:1,500 dilution in 3% BSA with PBS).

Scan DAPI (cell number) and LaminA/C intensity (knock-down efficiency) using the Acumen eX3 and Arrayscan VTi microscope.4.  Having identified the transfection reagent (Note 2), the optimal concentration needs to be determined for use in 384-well plates. For PC9 cells, we tested 0.025, 0.035, 0.045, 0.055, 0.065 and 0.075ul DharmaFECT 2 per well in 384 well format.5.  Optimal cell seeding density should be determined for each cell line. For PC9 cells, we tested 500, 750, 1,000 and 1,250 cells per well in a 384-well plate. We aimed at 80-90% confluence at the end of the experiment in untreated condition.6.  Optimal concentration and incubation time should be determined for each drug and each cell line. For erlotinib, we used 30~n M , a concentration slightly higher than the experimentally determined IC50 value for PC9 cells to bias towards detection of siRNA resulting in resistance.7.  Preferentially, individual cells should be distinguishable in order to allow scanning by Acumen. The cell line should grow as single-cell layer and not form condensed clumps. Each cell line should be tested prior to performing a screen to determine if cell number can be quantified successfully by the Acumen or Arrayscan. We used the 405 nm laser with 6~m W output, 500 V PMT and sensitivity at 2. These settings depend on the lifetime of the laser and should be optimized for each cell line.\n\n# Outline\n\n## siRNA Reverse Transfection\n## Cell Culture\nCulture PC-9 cells in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin.\n## siRNA Preparation\nResuspend the siRNA SMARTpools library in 1x siRNA buffer to reach a final concentration of 375 nM.\nNote: Upon arrival, the library was resuspended using 1x siRNA buffer into 3.75 µM stock solutions and stored at -20°C for long-term storage.\n## siRNA Aliquoting\nAliquot the siRNA SMARTpools from library assay plates using the BiomekFX into 384-well assay plates at a final concentration of 11 nM/well.\nPrepare all plates in triplicate for both the untreated and the drug-treated conditions.\n## Plate Preparation\nUse the first 4 columns of each plate for positive and negative siRNA controls.\nNote: The plates can be prepared beforehand, sealed and stored at -20°C.\n## Transfection\nOn the day of the reverse transfection, thaw the plates at RT for 20 min, and spin briefly for 1 min at 1,000 rpm (180xg) before removing the seal.\nAdd the siRNA controls in the first 4 columns if not done so at step A3.\n## DharmaFECT2 Addition\nDilute DharmaFECT2 in Opti-MEM media and add 3ul per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed.\nTap the plates to ensure the solutions mix well, and incubate the plates at RT for 15min.\n## Cell Addition\nTrypsinize and count the PC9 cells in quadruplicate using the Countess cell counter, and dilute the cell suspension appropriately.\nAdd 80ul cell suspension per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed.\n## Incubation\nIncubate cells in incubator at 37°C for 48h in a Cytomat incubator to ensure efficient protein knockdown.\n## Drug Treatment\n## Medium Removal\nRemove the medium using the Biotek PlateWasher.\n## Drug Addition\nAdd 80ul RMPI (supplemented with FBS and Pen/Strep) per well with or without drug using Xrd-384 dispenser at medium speed.\n## Incubation\nIncubate cells for a further 96 h.\n## Cell Number Quantification\n## Media Removal\nRemove media.\n## Cell Fixation\nFix the cells by adding 90ul of 80% ice-cold EtOH using Xrd-384 dispenser at low speed.\nStore plates for at least 1 h at -20°C.\n## Plate Washing\nWash the plates 3× with 100ul PBS using plate washer.\n## DAPI Staining\nAdd 20ul of a 1 ug/m/ DAPI solution to each well and incubate the cells at RT for 1 h.\n## Plate Sealing\nSeal the plates with adhesive foil seals.\n## Scanning\nScan the plates using Acumen with the 405 nm laser to quantify the number of cells in each plate.\n## Data Analysis\n## Data Normalization\nNormalize the data within each plate using a robust Z-score calculation.\nNormalize the data across the plates, separately for the untreated and drug-treated conditions.\n## Plotting\nPlot the smoothed Z-scores from the drug-treated condition against those from the untreated condition for each replicate.\n## Linear Regression\nDetermine the ‘line of best fit’ using linear regression.\n## Residual Difference Calculation\nCalculate the residual difference between each data point (drug treated versus untreated) as the perpendicular distance between each data point and the ‘line of best fit’.\n## siRNA Selection\nSelect siRNAs with a smoothed Z-score ≥ -2 in the untreated condition and with a median residual difference 2 (desensitizing) or e-2 (sensitizing).","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Pharmacology & Drug Development"}}
{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3667","title":"Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements in Arabidopsis Plants Using a Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) Fluorometer","text":"Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements in Arabidopsis Plants Using a Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) Fluorometer\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn this protocol, to analyze PSII activity in photosynthesis, we measure the Fv/Fm (For=For pm F0) value (Fo and Fm are the minimum and maximum values of chlorophyll fluorescence of dark-adapted leaves, respectively). Fv/Fm is a reliable marker of photo- inhibition (Krause et al., 1988). Chlorophyll fluorescence in leaves was measured at room temperature using  a  photosynthesis  yield  analyzer  (MINI-  PAM,  Walz,  Effeltrich,  Germany)  and  a pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometer (TEACHING-PAM, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Arabidopsis plants\n\nNote: We plated Nossen ecotype seeds that had been surface-sterilized on germination medium (GM) agar plates (Motohashi et al., 2003) containing % sucrose, with the appropriate selection agent (antibiotic or herbicide) per specific genotype. Plants were kept at 4~^°C for 3 days to improve germination rates and then grown in lighted growth chambers (CF-405, TOMY-Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) with approximately 75 μmol photon/m2/s at ^22^°C under a 16 h-light /8-h dark cycle (long-day conditions) for 3 weeks.\n\n# Equipment\n\n1.  Photosynthesis yield analyzer (Walz, MINI- PAM) (the equipment used in this protocol) (Figure 1).\n\nCompact design and easy operation are the most outstanding features of the MINI-PAM. This  device  is  in  particular  well-suited  for  determination  of  quantum  yield  and photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR). A flexible 5.5 m m square square glass fiberoptic was attached in the system and it can provide considerable high actinic intensities of white light. An optional 2 mm   plastic fiberoptic (MINI-PAM/F1) is also used by excellent signal quality and can be attached to the cover of an optional gas-exchange system for measuring both C O_2 and H_2O exchange as well as fluorescence. For an exact measuring quantum flux density and temperature at precisely the fluorescence measuring spot, a useful leaf-clip holder is available as an accessory (Arabidopsis Leaf-Clip Holder, model: 2060-B). This leaf clip holder is especially developed for small leaves like an Arabidopsis leaf. With the help of the leaf clip holder, the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) can be measured and an apparent electron transport rate (ETR) is calculated.\n\nA simple explanation of the equipment used can be found at the following URL (http://www.walz.com/downloads/manuals/mini-pam-II/MINI-PAM-II_Broschure.pdf). It should be noted that the current equipment being sold is the MINI-PAM II.\n\n()\nFigure 1. Photosynthesis yield analyzer\n\n2.  Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometer (TEACHING-PAM) (Walz) (alternative equipment which can be used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence)\n\nNote: It is noted here that the MINI- PAM and TEACHING-PAM were developed for beginners;  advanced  researchers  may  utilize  the  larger  PAM-2000  fluorometer (essentially the same instrument) to yield additional and more detailed results.\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\nProtocol  for  using  the  MINI-PAM  as  referenced  from  the  official  instruction  manual (TEACHING-PAM has a similar protocol and as such is not included here). Basically the most relevant fluorescence parameters of MINI-PAM are automatically obtained by a single key operation within a second and up to 4,000 data sets are stored for future analysis:(For reference, information regarding the MINI-PAM-II can be downloaded from the following URL: http://www.walz.com/downloads/manuals/mini-pam-II/MINI-PAM-II_Broschure.pdf.)1.  Plants grown normally for 3 weeks are dark-adapted for 20 min before chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. *In our case, dark-adapted means the plants are kept either in a dark drawer (for plated plants) or covered with a large box (for potted plants), in both cases in rooms with dark curtains and no artificial light sources.2.  Setup the MINI-PAM components. Additional peripheral components were connected to the four sockets at the side of the MINI-PAM Main Control Unit. PIN-assignments of “LEAF CLIP”, “RS 232”, “OUTPUT” and “CHARGE” indicate a Leaf Clip holder 2030-B, Computer control, Chart recorder and Battery Charger, respectively. The MINI-PAM was conceived as a typical stand-alone instrument for field experiments. Thus the actual measurement of the most relevant YIELD-parameter (quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion) just connected the fiberoprtics and leaf clip holder without conjunction with a PC and the WinControl software. So this protocol introduces the basic operation of the MINI-PAM without using computer control.3.  Activate the MINI-PAM by pressing the “ON” button. Under standard conditions, the measuring light is on automatically.4.  The AUTO-ZERO function (MODE-menu point 2) should be applied to determine the signal in absence of sample (background signal). To move to MODE-menu point 2, press “MODE” button (possible to omit) and “∧” button one times to select 2 of 51 points of the MODE-menu. Then push “SET” button to set the F value to zero (not stable, blinking) on measuring light (Figure 2).()Figure 2. F value blinks “0” after pressing the “SET” button5.  Place a dark-adapted leaf sample on the measuring head of the Leaf Clip holder. The distance between sample and fiberoptics should be about 10-15 mm (Figure 3). We dark-adapt the plants by either putting them in drawers (for dished plants) or covering them with boxes (for potted plants) – in both cases dark curtains are used and all artificial lights are turned off. Temperature when measuring should be the same as the growth environment.()# Figure 3. A photo of the leaf clip holder and fiberoptics6.  Just press the “START” button. Measuring the fluorescence parameters is proceeding automatically within seconds (see below).a.  the minimum fluorescence in dark-adapted state (Fo) is sampled (displayed as ...F).b.  a saturation pulse is applied.c.  a saturation pulse induced maximum fluorescence in dark-adapted state (Fm) is sampled (displayed as …M).d.  YIELD ^= (Fm-Fo)/Fm=Fv/Fm is calculated and shown on the display as …Y.e.  When you use the Leaf Clip holder, the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature at the same spot of a leaf where fluorescence is measured is also sampled (displayed as …L and …C, respectively).f.   The apparent rate of electron transport (ETR) risingdotseq YIELD x PAR x 0.5 x ETR-factor (0.84) is calculated (displayed as …E).7.  The parameter indicated by the above is shown to a screen after measurement (Figure 4). The obtained data are stored in the MEMORY. Arabidopsis plants under normal growth condition shows an Fv/Fm value between 0.75 to 0.85. (If Fm/Fv is not between 0.75 and 0.85, it is highly likely that the sample Arabidopsis plants are in poor health or not properly grown.)()Figure 4. A photo of the machine display after measurement8.  If you want to know only the Fv/Fm value, following analysis is not needed.On the other hand, when leaf is illuminated, its fluorescence yield can change between Fo and Fm, which can be assessed after well dark-adaptation. Lower Fm value under light conditions may be caused either by photochemical quenching or by non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The quenching coefficients are defined as follows:qP=(Fm’-F)/(Fm’-Fo)qN=(Fm-Fm’)/(Fm-Fo)NPQ=(Fm-Fm’)/Fm’A saturation pulse induced maximum fluorescence during light adaptation (Fm’) is sampled (displayed as …M).9.  These quenching coefficients need to sample four values (Fo, Fm, F and Fm’). Others are calculated values by using these four parameters. The value of Fo and Fm were previously measured by using a dark-adapted leaf sample. Thus, these values need to store in the MINI-PAM system.10. The MODE-menu point 25 (Fo and Fm) should be applied to store the values of Fo and Fm (Figure 5). This function to sample Fo and Fm of a dark-adapted leaf by use of the SET-key. The stored Fo and Fm values are used for determination of qP, qN and NPQ.()Figure 5. A photo of the display when setting Fo and Fm (“Mode” menu 25)11. Then light adapted leaf samples are prepared. A same as a dark-adapted leaf sample, press the “START” button on procedure 6. Measuring the fluorescence parameters under light condition is proceeding automatically within seconds and calculated qP, qN and NPQ as well as YIELD (Fv’/Fm’), ETR and PAR. The obtained data are stored in the MEMORY.12. Recall on display via MEM-key. Push “MEM” button and select measured sample by using “∧” and “∨” button.13. In the top line it can be seen the data set number and recording day time (Figure 6A). The bottom line shows YIELD (Y), ETR (E) and PAR (L).14. More information of data set can be displayed by pushing “SET” button. After the first SET, the top line shows the fluorescence yield measured briefly before the saturating light pulse (F), the maximum fluorescence (M) and temperature (C) (Figure 6B).15. After the second SET, the top line shows the quenching coefficients qP (P), qN (N) and NPQ (Q) (Figure 6C).()Figure 6. A photo showing the display for “Mode” menu 25. A. The first display line shows data set number and recording day/time. The second line shows YIELD (Y), ETR (E) and PAR (L). B. The first display line shows the fluorescence yield measured briefly before saturating light pulse (F), the maximum fluorescence (M) and temperature (C). C. The first display line shows the quenching coefficients qP (P), qN (N) and NPQ (Q).16. Repeat the same measurement at least four times and average results.# Notes1.  In order to obtain reliably reproducible data, it is imperative that the plant growth environment be as uniform / consistent as possible.  For example depending on light environment the value of a plant chlorophyll fluorescence will fluctuate.  The amount of light a plant receives when next to the side light on the growth incubator is completely different from the light it receives when on the center of the shelf.  For the reason it is important to shuffle the location of growth mediums, etc (Figure 7).()Figure 7. A visual example of how growth mediums might be shuffled2.  At  least  5  replicates  are  measured,  with  final  data  being  an  average  of  these measurements. As measurement with the MINI-PAM is very easy and results are consistent over each measurement, measuring twice is enough to satisfy technical duplication requirements.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Preparation of Plants\nGrow plants normally for 3 weeks.\nDark-adapt plants for 20 min before chlorophyll fluorescence measurements.\n## Setup of MINI-PAM Components\nConnect additional peripheral components to the four sockets at the side of the MINI-PAM Main Control Unit.\nIdentify PIN-assignments of 'LEAF CLIP', 'RS 232', 'OUTPUT' and 'CHARGE' indicate a Leaf Clip holder 2030-B, Computer control, Chart recorder and Battery Charger, respectively.\n## Activation and Calibration of MINI-PAM\nActivate the MINI-PAM by pressing the 'ON' button.\n## AUTO-ZERO Function\nApply the AUTO-ZERO function (MODE-menu point 2) to determine the signal in absence of sample (background signal).\nPress 'MODE' button and '∧' button one time to select 2 of 51 points of the MODE-menu.\nPush 'SET' button to set the F value to zero (not stable, blinking) on measuring light.\n## Measurement of Fluorescence Parameters\nPlace a dark-adapted leaf sample on the measuring head of the Leaf Clip holder.\nPress the 'START' button to measure the fluorescence parameters automatically within seconds.\n## Measurement Parameters\nThe minimum fluorescence in dark-adapted state (Fo) is sampled.\nA saturation pulse is applied.\nThe saturation pulse induced maximum fluorescence in dark-adapted state (Fm) is sampled.\nYIELD ^= (Fm-Fo)/Fm=Fv/Fm is calculated and shown on the display.\nThe photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature at the same spot of a leaf where fluorescence is measured is also sampled.\n## Data Storage and Recall\nThe obtained data are stored in the MEMORY.\nRecall data on display via MEM-key.\nPush 'MEM' button and select measured sample by using '∧' and '∨' button.\n## Data Analysis\nView data set number and recording day time.\nView YIELD (Y), ETR (E) and PAR (L).\n## Detailed Data Analysis\nPush 'SET' button to view the fluorescence yield measured briefly before the saturating light pulse (F), the maximum fluorescence (M) and temperature (C).\nPush 'SET' button again to view the quenching coefficients qP (P), qN (N) and NPQ (Q).\n## Measurement of Quenching Coefficients\nPrepare light adapted leaf samples.\nMeasure the fluorescence parameters under light condition automatically within seconds.\nCalculate qP, qN and NPQ as well as YIELD (Fv'/Fm'), ETR and PAR.\n## Replication and Averaging of Measurements\nRepeat the same measurement at least four times.\nAverage the results to obtain reliable data.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Plant Science & Technology"}}

Wisniewski","text":"Water Deficit Treatment and Measurement in Apple Trees Carole L. Bassett*, Timothy S. Artlip* and Michael E. Wisniewski\n\n# Abstract\n\nWater is considered perhaps the most limiting factor for plant growth and productivity (Boyer, 1982), and climate change predicts more frequent, more severe and longer drought periods for a significant portion of the world in coming years. Unfortunately, drought resistance is particularly difficult to measure due in part to the complexity of the underlying biology that contributes to a plant’s ability to cope with water limitations. For example, water deficit is frequently examined by detaching leaves or withholding water for a set period of time prior to tissue collection.  Such approaches may elucidate the early stages of drought response but are generally not physiologically relevant for maintenance of drought resistance over a longer period.  A more realistic approach is to impose a gradual water limitation with a sustained soil moisture level, particularly in the case of woody perennials. We describe here a protocol that imposes a long-term water deficit under controlled laboratory conditions that allow a molecular biology approach to understanding how woody plants survive severe water limitations.  Representative data can be found in Artlip et al. (1997) and Bassett et al. (2014).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Woody plants (seedlings, grafted, or own-rooted)\n2.

Trees are placed in a Conviron PGV36 growth chamber (Conviron) at _25~^°C day (16 h)/18 ^°C night (8 h) with light at 500 umol photons Im^2/s PPFD.2.  The pot is then watered to saturation and weighed one to two hours later.3.  To  mimic  field  conditions  where  water  is  lost  to  the  atmosphere  by  evapotranspiration (evaporation from the soil plus transpiration by the plant), the soil surface is left exposed. To measure transpiration alone, a moisture barrier, typically aluminum foil, is placed over the pot and around the stem of the tree.4.  Water is withheld and the pot weighed at the same time of day on a daily basis. Control plants are watered to saturation (90-95% pot weight) every other day. Care should be taken not to over water the controls as this can cause ‘flooding’ symptoms, i.e., wilting, chlorosis etc.5.  Water deficit should be imposed by withholding water until the pot masses are 45% of the saturated mass and maintained at this level for two weeks by adding back water to the 45% level; control trees are rewatered to the saturated weight.  Sufficient trees should be used for statistical analysis (to be determined by the user). We typically used four replicates per apple line, per treatment and an equivalent number of control trees.6.  Water status of plants should be determined in order to quantify the water deficit.  Common measurements include water potential (Scholander pressure bomb with leaves, branches or stems; Scholander et al., 1964), leaf size (Bassett et al., 2011), leaf number (Figure 2) or relative water content (RWC; Sinclair and Ludlow, 1985), although Kramer (1990) argued that water potential is a preferable measure owing to its being commensurable with atmospheric or soil water measurements. This measurement should be done pre-dawn or with foil-covered leaves. A water status of -1.9 MPa can be achieved with peach trees (Artlip et al., 1997). Researchers in the field (e.g., Hsiao, 1973) consider a water potential of this magnitude to impose a severe stress on the plant.7.  It is important to note that plant size relative to pot size is important (large plant in a small pot is not equivalent to a large plant in a large pot) to prevent plants from becoming root-bound. We found that 5 pots were ideal to grow trees to 1 m prior to selection for the drought experiments. It should be emphsized that different cultivars or geographical populations can differ in their water use efficiency or dehydration tolerance. Obviously, if a lesser degree of stress is desired, more water added back would increase the water status of the tree.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Plant Preparation\n## Own-Rooted ‘Royal Gala’\nExplants were propagated in tissue culture as described by Norelli et al.

Infect confluent CEF cells with FWPV or MVA at 0.01 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell. Note: The number of cells to infect will depend on the number of chimaeric MVA viruses to be made. As a guide, 30 infected 175 cm2 flasks of FWPV yields ~150 μg DNA; 2 infected175 cm2 flasks of MVA yields ~800 ng DNA.2.  Culture in virus growth medium at 37^°C 5% C O_2 for 5-7 days, until extensive cytopathic effects are visible.3.  Freeze-thaw the culture (still in the flask) 3 times. Note: Freeze at -80~^°C. . The flask may be thawed at room temperature or 37 ^°C_: , but do not leave at elevated temperature longer than absolutely necessary.4.  Transfer the infected cell lysate to a centrifuge tube.5.  Centrifuge at 1,500xg for 15min .6.  Transfer the supernatant to an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal filter unit (100 kDa NMWL).7.  Centrifuge at 1,500xg for 60m i n at 4^°C .8.  Resuspend the lysate retained on the membrane (approx. 200 μl) containing virus particles in _2m l TE.9.  Store at 4^°C overnight, or proceed directly to Section B.B. Extraction of DNA from purified viral particles1.  Combine the purified viral particles with an equal volume of 2x extraction buffer.2.  Incubate at 55^°C for ^2h .3.  Add an equal volume of phenol saturated with 10 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0.4.  Agitate at room temperature for 195~m i n .5.  Centrifuge at 1,500xg for 5 min.6.  Transfer the aqueous layer to an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol(25:24:1, saturated with 10m M Tris, p H8.0_,^ ).7.  Agitate at room temperature for 1~h~ .8.  Centrifuge at 1,500xg for 5 min.9.  Transfer the aqueous layer to an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform-isoamyl alcohol.10. Agitate at room temperature for 1 h .11. Centrifuge at 1,500xg for 5 min.12.

Wash the DNA pellet in 70% ethanol.17. Air-dry the DNA pellet.18. Dissolve the DNA pellet in 200 μl 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.5).19. Store DNA at -80 or -20~^°C .C. Assembly of linear recombination templates. See Figure 1 for a schematic showing the final assembled recombination template.Note: For steps C1-3, the following conditions are recommended: initial denaturation at 94~^°C, , followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94~^°C for 30 sec, annealing for 30 sec, and extension at 68~^°C for 1 min per kilobase. Add a final extension step at 68 ^° C for 10 min. Reactions should contain 300 nM of each primer. See “Standard PCR Protocol” (He, 2011).1.  Using PCR and 0.02 W/ul of Accuprime Taq High Fidelity polymerase with the supplied polymerase Buffer II, amplify a 489 bp product from 20 ng of purified MVA DNA template with  primers  KB1F  (TGGTCAATCGCCATTTGTTCG)  and  KB1R (GGACATAGTGCCTTGTATTATG). Set the annealing temperature to 43~^°C , and cycling extension to 30 sec. This product will be referred to as FLL.2.  Using PCR and a high fidelity polymerase, amplify a 557 bp PCR product from 20 ng of purified MVA DNA template with primers KB4F (GCTATTCGACATCGAGAACAATCTTTGC-TAGAGAGAAAGC) and KB4R (GAGGGATATTAAGTCGATAG). Set the annealing temperature to 40~^°C , and cycling extension to 30 sec. This product will be referred to as FLR.3.  Using PCR and a high fidelity polymerase, amplify a 853 bp PCR product from a plasmid containing the E. coli GPT gene downstream of the Vaccinia virus p7.5 promoter (e.g. plasmid pGNR, as described in Boulanger et al. (1998). In this publication, a cassette containing the E. coli gpt gene under the control of the vaccinia virus p7.5 early/late promoter  was  cloned  into  the  SmaI  site  of  pNEB193.  Primers  are  KB3F (GGATGCAGCCTCCAG-AATAC) and KB3R (GCTTTCTCTCTAGCAAAGATTGTTCTCGATGTCGAATAGC).  Set  the  annealing temperature to 46^°C , and cycling extension to 60 sec.4.  After confirming that all PCRs contain a single product of the expected size, purify each product using a QIAquick PCR Purification kit and elute into 10m M Tris-Cl (p H8.5) .5.  Use splice-overlap-extension PCR to anneal the GPT and FLR products together: The first 5 cycles are annealed at 57~^°C in the absence of primers. Primers KB3F and KB4R are then added prior to an additional 30 cycles with annealing at 43~^°C . This 1,390 bp product, referred to as RHS, should be purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, but avoid exposure to ultraviolet light.6.  Design primers to amplify the FWPV gene of interest. The forward primer should have a varsigma_^ tail complementary to primer KB1R. The reverse primer should have a varsigma^, tail complementary to primer KB3F. The FWPV product can be up to 8 kbp long.7.  Using PCR and a high fidelity polymerase, amplify the FWPV product designed in step C6 from 100 ng of purified FWPV DNA (from step B). Purify this product by agarose gel electrophoresis and a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit. Elute into 10 mM Tris-Cl (p H8.5) . Products over 2 kbp should not be exposed to ultraviolet light, to avoid photo-nicking.8.  Use splice-overlap-extension PCR to assemble the FWPV product with FLL and RHS, using equimolar amounts of each component. For a 8 kbp FWPV product, initially combine 10 ng of FLL with 160 ng of the FWPV product, in the absence of primers, for 16 cycles, with annealing at 43~^°C and 30 sec extension time. Then add 30 ng RHS for a further 6 cycles, with annealing at 45~^°C and 90 sec extension time. Then add primers KB1F and KB4R for a final 20 cycles with annealing at 39^°C and 9 min extension time. Note: Extension times are given assuming use of a high fidelity polymerase with an extension time of 1 min per kbp.9.  Purify the assembled FLL-FWPV-RHS cassette using gel electrophoresis and theQIAquick gel extraction kit. Elute into 10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA (p H8.0) . Products over 2 kbp should not be exposed to ultraviolet light.D. Transfection of linear recombination templates1.  Culture DF-1 cells in DF-1 culture medium.2.  In a 12.5 c m^2 tissue culture flask, infect DF-1 cells at 70% confluency with MVA at 3 pfu/cell: a.  De-aggregate virus in a cuphorn sonicator for 30 sec. Set sonicator to 100% output power, with pulse on/off at 1 sec intervals. Note: During sonication, vial should be floating approximately 2-4 cm above the horn. Ice may be added to the water in the cup, to prevent overheating. b.  Dilute virus in serum-free DMEM. c.  Aspirate medium from DF-1 cells and replace with diluted virus in a volume just sufficient to cover the cell monolayer (e.g. 1 ml for 12.5c m^2. ). d.  Incubate at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 90 m i n .3.  Meanwhile, mix the linear recombination template from step C (at least 35n g ) with 2.5ug of salmon sperm carrier DNA in Opti-MEM to a final volume of 100 microlitres. Add 12 ul of Polyfect. Allow to complex at room temperature for 5-15 min. Add 5 ml DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS (v/v) and mix by pipetting.4.  Aspirate the virus from the DF-1 cells infected in step D2. Add the transfection mix prepared in step D3.5.  Incubate the infected/transfected cells at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 3 days.6.  Harvest the cells with a cell scraper to scrape the cells off the plastic and into the culture medium. Transfer to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,500xg for 5 min.7.  Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of supernatant, discarding the rest of the supernatant. Typically, this yields approximately 1.4~ml cell lysate. Transfer to a screw-cap microtube and freeze-thaw 3 times.# E. Selection of chimaeric MVANote: Three serial passages of chimaeric MVA in selection media are usually sufficient to remove parental MVA, but this should be confirmed by PCR analysis.1.  Defrost the transfection-infection harvest from step D7 and de-aggregate the virus particles in a cuphorn sonicator for 30 sec, as in step D2a.2.  Dilute 0.1% of the harvested volume (e.g. 1.4 μl of a 1.4~ml harvest) from step D6 into 2 ml serum-free DMEM.3.  Aspirate the culture media from 80-100% confluent CEF cells in a 25~c m^2 tissue culture flask and replace with the diluted virus.4.  Incubate at 37^°C , 5% CO2 for 90m i n .5.  Aspirate virus from cells and replace with 2% DMEM ^+ MXH.6.  Culture at 37^°C , 5% C O_2 for 6 days.7.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3759","title":"Quantification of Extracellular Ammonium Concentrations and Transporter Activity in Yeast Using AmTrac Fluorescent Sensors","text":"Quantification of Extracellular Ammonium Concentrations and Transporter Activity in Yeast Using AmTrac Fluorescent Sensors\n\n# Abstract\n\nAmTracs are the first example of “activity sensors”, since they report the activity of ammonium transporters by means of fluorescence readout in vivo (De Michele et al., 2013). AmTracs are based on a single fluorescent protein, a circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP), inserted into the cytosolic loop connecting the two pseudosymmetrical halves of the Arabidopsis and yeast plasma membrane ammonium transporters AtAMTs and ScMEP (Figure 1). Recently, FRETbased activity sensors for nitrate and peptide transporters have also been developed (Ho et al., 2014). Since transporter activity directly depends on the availability of substrate, AmTracs measure extracellular ammonium concentrations. Several versions of AmTrac exist, with different fluorescence intensity (FI) responses and affinities for ammonium, and based on different ammonium transporters (AmTrac: AtAMT1;3; AmTrac1;2: At AMT1;2; MepTrac: ScMEP2). Currently, the most useful AmTrac versions are probably AmTrac-GS (bright, with Km of 50~uM) ) and AmTrac-100 (a high capacity version with Km of 100 uM) . The protocol for measuring ammonium concentrations in yeast cells at the fluorimeter is the same for all versions.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Strain 31019b lacks the endogenous ammonium transporters MEP1-3 and therefore can grow on ammonium as sole nitrogen source only when transformed with vectors harboring functional ammonium transporters. AmTrac should work in any transformable strain.\n2.  Vector pDR-F’-GW containing AmTrac under control of strong PMA promoter and ADH terminator, and with the selection marker URA3 Note: Vectors with many different AmTrac- and MepTrac versions are available through Addgene (www.addgene.org).

Fluorimeter for 96 well plates (for example: Tecan Trading AG, Safire or M1000)\n\n\n\n# Protocol\n\n1.  Transform yeast with the pDR-F’ vector containing the desired AmTrac. We routinely use the lithium acetate method (Gietz et al., 1992). Briefly, we add about 100 ng plasmid to a PCR tube containing 100~ul of the transformation solution (containing PEG, lithium acetate, salmon sperm DNA and yeast cells) and heat-shock at 42~^°C for 13 m i n . The first time the reader might also transform with an empty vector, to measure background fluorescence.2.  Plate the transformation on selective synthetic dextrose minimal medium (SD), with 1 mM arginine (from a filter-sterilized 50x stock dissolved in water) as sole nitrogen source. Wrap the plate in plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration.3.  Incubate the plate (upside down to prevent condensation) at 28-30^°C for 3 days.4.  In the sterile hood, pick a colony with a sterile 1 ml pipette and place it in a 50~ml tube containing 5ml SD medium, supplemented with 0.1% proline (from a filter-sterilized 100× stock dissolved in water).5.  Tape the opening of the tube with surgical tape to prevent contamination, still allowing gas exchange.6.  Place the tube in a rack in the orbital shaker.7.  Grow for 36-48~h~ at 30~^°C , 230 rpm. The culture should at least be turbid (O D e_000>O.5) . Even at saturation, the sensor still works. Avoid overgrowth though, since cells will start to die and degrade the sensors. In that case, start a new inoculum.8.  Remove the tip with forceps, and centrifuge at 3,000 rcf at RT for 5 min to pellet the cells.9.  Discard the supernatant by inversion. The reader should see a whitish pellet.10. Resuspend the pellet in ^20mI washing buffer, RT. The reader can ease resuspension by pipetting up and down, or by pouring a few ml first, shaking vigorously, and then bringing to volume.11. Centrifuge as above (step 8).12. Wash the pellet a second time as in step 10, to remove any trace of growth medium and released ammonium.13. Resuspend the pellet in 5ml resuspension buffer.14. Pipette 200~ul of the culture in a well of the microplate and measure OD600 using the spectrofluorometer (mode: absorbance). As blank, use 200~ul of resuspension buffer in another well.15. Adjust to O D_600=0.5 by diluting with resuspension buffer in the 50ml tube.16. Mix well and aliquot in the wells, 200ul each.17. An excitation and emission spectrum should be recorded first to confirm the fluorescence properties of the cpGFP as part of the sensors (parameters: mode: fluorescence; read: bottom reading; excitation: Fix emission to 530 and record spectra from 350-510 n m ; emission: fix the excitation to 480~n m and record the spectra from 500600 n m ; step size 5 nm: bandwidth: 7.5/7.5 nm ; gain:100), see Figure 2A. With knowledge of the major excitation maximum the reader can decide on the excitation wavelength for the single point measurements.18. Read basal fluorescence. It should be the same for all wells (parameters: mode: fluorescence; read: bottom reading; excitation: 488 n m ; emission: 513n m ; bandwidth: 7.5/7.5 nm; gain:100; shake: orbital, medium, 3 sec, initial and between readings).19. Since response is saturated above 1 mM for all variants, it can be useful to make acalibration curve with ammonium chloride ranging from 0 to 1m M final concentration in the wells (0,1uM,10uM,100uM,1mM). see Figure 1B. It is useful to include negative controls, e.g. sodium chloride, to exclude artifacts and to include other salts to check for specificity. In that case, use the highest concentration (e.g. 1 or 10m M, ), see Figure 2C.20. Add the treatment solutions (as 5× concentrated stocks, dissolved in water) to the compartments of the reservoir (Figure 3).21. Add 50~ul of each treatment solution or water control to each wells with a multichannel pipette, pipetting up and down for about 5 times for mixing the treatment with the cells. Set up at least three replicates per treatment.22. Response is immediate, within the time limits of the microplate reader. With the parameters as above, it takes about 1 min to read a full plate.23. Repeat reading as step 18 after 5 min from the treatment. We usually consider these latter responses, as they tend to be a bit stronger.()Figure 2. A. Excitation and emission spectra of AmTrac-GS treated with indicated ammonium chloride concentration. Data are normalized to the initial value. B. Response of AmTrac and AmTrac-100 to increasing concentrations of ammonium chloride. C. Specificity of AmTrac, the concentration of the indicated salts was 1 mM (De Michele et al., 2013).()Figure 3. Schematic representation of the treatment procedure for building a calibration  curve. Wells in a microplate are filled with 200~ul of yeast culture, resuspended in 50mM MES buffer with 5% glycerol. Samples can be arranged in columns, with triplicates for each construct. Fluorescence from yeast transformed with the empty vector will be used as background value. After reading basal fluorescence, 50ul of 5× stock treatment will be added to the wells, by using a multichannel pipette. In this example, we use a solvent control (water), four concentrations of increasing magnitude of N H_4C l , and a chloride control at the highest concentration.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Yeast Transformation\nTransform yeast with the pDR-F’ vector containing the desired AmTrac using the lithium acetate method.\nAdd about 100 ng plasmid to a PCR tube containing 100~ul of the transformation solution and heat-shock at 42~^°C for 13 minutes.\nTransform with an empty vector to measure background fluorescence, if desired.\n## Plate Transformation on Selective Medium\nPlate the transformation on selective synthetic dextrose minimal medium (SD) with 1 mM arginine as sole nitrogen source.\nWrap the plate in plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration.\n## Incubate the Plate\nIncubate the plate upside down at 28-30^°C for 3 days to prevent condensation.\n## Pick a Colony and Grow in Liquid Medium\nPick a colony with a sterile 1 ml pipette and place it in a 50~ml tube containing 5ml SD medium supplemented with 0.1% proline.\nTape the opening of the tube with surgical tape to prevent contamination while allowing gas exchange.\nPlace the tube in a rack in the orbital shaker.\n## Grow the Culture\nGrow the culture at 30~^°C, 230 rpm for 36-48~h~ until it reaches a turbidity of OD600 > 0.5.\nAvoid overgrowth, as cells may start to die and degrade the sensors.\n## Harvest and Wash the Cells\nRemove the tip with forceps and centrifuge at 3,000 rcf at RT for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nDiscard the supernatant by inversion.\nResuspend the pellet in 20mI washing buffer at RT.\nCentrifuge again and wash the pellet a second time to remove any trace of growth medium and released ammonium.\n## Resuspend the Cells in Resuspension Buffer\nResuspend the pellet in 5ml resuspension buffer.\nPipette 200~ul of the culture into a well of the microplate and measure OD600 using the spectrofluorometer.\n## Adjust the Cell Density\nAdjust the cell density to OD600 = 0.5 by diluting with resuspension buffer.\nMix well and aliquot 200ul into the wells.\n## Record Excitation and Emission Spectra\nRecord excitation and emission spectra to confirm the fluorescence properties of the cpGFP as part of the sensors.\nUse the parameters: mode: fluorescence; read: bottom reading; excitation: Fix emission to 530 and record spectra from 350-510 nm; emission: fix the excitation to 480~nm and record the spectra from 500-600 nm.\n## Read Basal Fluorescence\nRead basal fluorescence using the parameters: mode: fluorescence; read: bottom reading; excitation: 488 nm; emission: 513 nm; bandwidth: 7.5/7.5 nm; gain: 100.\nShake the plate orbitally, medium, 3 sec, initial and between readings.\n## Create a Calibration Curve\nCreate a calibration curve with ammonium chloride ranging from 0 to 1mM final concentration in the wells.\nInclude negative controls, such as sodium chloride, to exclude artifacts and check for specificity.\n## Add Treatment Solutions\nAdd 50~ul of each treatment solution or water control to each well with a multichannel pipette.\nPipette up and down for about 5 times to mix the treatment with the cells.\nSet up at least three replicates per treatment.\n## Read Response\nRead the response after 5 min from the treatment using the same parameters as for basal fluorescence.\nConsider these latter responses, as they tend to be a bit stronger.","meta":{"source_file":"bio_protocol.json","primary_domain":"Molecular Biology Techniques"}}

Starch granules isolationStarch granules were purified following a modification of the Percoll method described by Tenorio et al. (2003).1.  Homogenize 600~m g (fresh weight) of Arabidopsis leaves in a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid N_2 to a fine powder and add 1~ml of extraction buffer. Leaf material was collected from fully developed rosette leaves from at least three different plants at growth stage 3.50 according to Boyes et al. (2001).2.  Filter the homogenate through two layers of Miracloth on 15ml Falcon-type tubes.3.  Add 5 ml of Percoll buffer (4^°C) to the filtrate and mix.4. Centrifuge samples for 5 min, 805 x g at 4~^°C (2,000 rpm, Eppendorf-5810 R centrifuge) and discard the supernatant.5.  Wash the pellet by resuspension in 5~ml washing buffer (4~^°C) , centrifuge as in step A4 and discard the supernatant. Repeat three times.6.  Air-dry the pellet (do not let it dry completely) containing the starch granules (Figure 1) and use it immediately for determination of GBSS activity as described below.()Figure 1. Immunodetection of GBSS in starch granules isolated from Arabidopsis Col0 leaves. Western blot employing GBSS‐specific antibodies in protein extracts from starch granules isolated from wild‐type (Col-0), GBSS mutant (gbs-1) and a recombinant line in which GBSS is fused to GFP. Molecular Mass (MM) markers are shown in kDa (left). Notice GBSS MM around 55k D a and GBSS-GFP around 80~ k D a . GBSS detection is strictly associated to starch granules fractions (three rightmost lanes) and cannot be detected in a soluble protein fraction (leftmost lane).B.  GBSS activity assayThe granule-bound starch synthase activity was immediately measured from freshly purified starch granules.1.  Starch granules were resuspended in 200ul of 100m M Tricine (p H8.4) , 25 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA and 10~m M ADP U- ^14C glucose (specific activity 7.4 GBq/mol).2. 100~ul aliquot was quickly extracted and boiled for 5 min to represent DPMtotal of the assay.3.  The rest of the reaction was incubated at 30~^°C for 20-60 min.4.  The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min.5.  Starch granules were precipitated by adding 1.875~ml of precipitation buffer and 25~ul of glycogen solution as an inert carrier to increase recovery from alcohol precipitation.6.  Tubes were centrifuged 3 min, 2,000 x g at 4~^°C (4,615 rpm, Eppendorf-5424) and the supernatant discarded.7.  The pellet was resuspended in 0.2Omega_ml deionized water and washed by an additional precipitation with 1.750ml precipitation buffer without glycogen.8.  Tubes were centrifuged as in step B5. The pellet was air-dried for a short time, resuspended in 1ml of deionized water and transferred into an appropriate scintillation vial.9. 5ml of EcoLite liquid scintillation cocktail was added to enhance ^14C counting efficiency.10. Finally, the radioactivity incorporated into the starch granules was determined with a scintillation counter.11. GBSS activity (see Table 1 and Figure 2) is calculated by using the following formula: Activity (nmol/min/gfw)= 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷∗  ∗𝑡 𝑡 𝑛∗𝑛 𝑛𝑔𝑔𝑛𝑔𝑛𝑔𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔 DPMreac = disintegration per minute of the reaction sample minus DPM blank (Table 1) nmol = nmoles of ADP U- ^14C_.^. glucose (1,000 nmol according to the protocol) DPMtotal = total DPM of added ADPU- ^14C_.^. glucose (step B2) = reaction time (min) (20-60 min according to the protocol) gfw = fresh weight (g) ( _0.39 according to the protocol)# Table 1.

Blank sample is identical to each sample except that it was stopped at time 0, so that the reaction was not allowed to start.b. To simplify, a single sample measurement is shown in Table 1. We recommend calculating data from three independent experiments. Sample DPM correspond to the Disintegration Per Minute at the desired reaction time for each sample (experimental data).DPMtotal is the total amount of DPM provided by the radiolabelled substrate. It actually represents the maximum of DPM for each sample. According to the above example it consists on the total DPM given by 1,000 nmol of ADPU- ^14C_.^. glucose determined for aliquots from step B2.d. DPMreac = DPMsample minus DPMblank()Figure 2.

Here, we describe an accelerated storage stability study for the potential anti-anthrax  therapeutic,  EnvD,  a  poly-γ-D-glutamic  acid  (PDGA)  depolymerase.  Storage conditions were based on those recommended by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3877","title":"Hypoxia Studies with Pimonidazole in vivo","text":"Hypoxia Studies with Pimonidazole in vivo\n\n# Abstract\n\nTherapy-induced  hypoxia drives changes  in  the  tumor  microenvironment  that contribute to the poor response to therapy. Hypoxia is capable of driving the expression and/or activation of specific signaling cascades (e.g., c-Met, Axl, CTGF), the recruitment of tumor promoting immune cells, and the induction of cell survival pathways including autophagy (Phan et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2010). We have recently shown that anti-VEGF therapyinduced hypoxia can result in changes in the extracellular matrix that contribute to the aggressiveness of tumors post therapy (Aguilera et al., 2014). Importantly, therapies that induce hypoxia do not always increase epithelial plasticity and tumor aggressiveness (Ostapoff et al., 2013; Cenik et al., 2013). We have used pimonidazole to evaluate hypoxia in tumors and herein provide a detailed protocol for this useful tool to interrogate the levels of hypoxia in vivo.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n# Protocol\n\nThe following procedure measures hypoxia in tumor-bearing mice and can be used at any respective end point of an animal experiment.1.  The HypoxyprobeTM (pimonidazole hydrochloride) is resuspended at a concentration of 30mg/ml in 0.9% sterile saline.2.  Multiple  mice aOmega=5 per  group  is  optimal  for  statistical  relevance)  are  injected intravenously (tail vein) with 60mg/kg of the pimonidazole solution.()Figure 1. Tail Vein Injection protocol. 1. Obtain a Tailveiner Restrainer. 2. Insert mouse and push the restrainer to set the mouse in position. 3. Rotate the tail 45 degrees in order to find and inject the tail vein with the needle. 4. Close representation of the tail vein injection. 5. The appearance of blood validates a successful tail vein injection.3.  Let circulate in vivo for 90 min before the mice are euthanazied with isoflurane or carbon dioxide (C O_2) .Note: For animal euthanasia: In compliance with proper IACUC protocols, animals are placed in a drop jar or vaporizer in the presence of controlled concentrations of isoflurane or CO2 in order to ensure proper inhalation. Animals are then sacrificed by a secondary method with cervical dislocation.4.  Organs are then removed, weighed, snap-frozen, and stored in plastic scintillation vials at - -80~^°C .Note: The pimonidazole stain can work on paraffin-embedded tissue, frozen tissue, and cell lines.5.  Organs are then taken out of the scintillation vials, embedded in OCT, placed in a cryostat, and cut into 10 um -thick sections. Sections are placed on microscope slides for staining. Notes: Cryostat settings a.  Temperature used can range from -10 to -5O~^°C depending on tissue type, though - ^20^°C is recommended for the majority of tissues. b.  Alternate between “Trimming mode” (cuts 5 - 150 µm) and “Sectioning mode” (0.5 - 50 µm) in order to adjust the tissue for the beginning of section collection. c.  The speed of sectioning is dependent of the researcher’s own speed. d.  As many sections as necessary can be cut per organ used. e.  To achieve a proper representation of the sample, cut non-serial sections of the tissue.6.  Frozen tissue sections are then interrogated with FITC-conjugated anti-pimonidazole primary antibody (included in kit) and endothelial cell markers (CD31, Meca-32, or endomucin) followed by respective Cy3-conjugated secondary IgG. Use a slide incubated with only antibody diluent as its primary antibody as a negative control.a.  The Hypoxyprobe™-1 Plus Kit recommends a 1:50 - 100 dilution of the secondary rabbit anti-FITC horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody.b.  For other primary antibodies a 1:50 - 1:100 dilution is recommended, unless otherwise specified by respective primary antibody data sheets.Notes:a.  Any suitably labeled, secondary anti-FITC antibody can be used which would bind to the pimonidazole adducts in hypoxic cells within the tissues.b.  This staining should be done within a week of harvesting the organs as the signal will begin to fade.c.  The interrogation of hypoxia within animal tissues is not limited to fluorescent staining as it can be done with brown stain (DAB) as well. Respective primary and secondary antibodies can be utilized to achieve both types of staining.7.  Example of a fluorescent tissue-staining protocol for frozen sections:a.  Air dry frozen slides.b. Fix the slides with Acetone for 30 sec - 2 min.c. Briefly air dry sections a few seconds (do not let tissue dry completely).d. Rehydrate sections with PBS-t 2 times, 5 min each. Note: Once the tissue is rehydrated, do not let the slides dry out.e.  Block in your favorite blocking solution (typically 20% aqua block in PBS) 10-30m i n .f.     Pour off the blocking solution, add primary antibody and incubate 1 h at room temperature-overnight at 4^°C .g.  Wash the slides with PBS-t 3 times, 5 min each.h.  Incubate the slides with secondary antibody 1 h at room temperature.i.     Wash with PBS-t 4 times, 5 min each.j. Mount the slides with prolong gold mounting solution and coverslip.k.  Apply sealant (e.g. clear nail polish) along the edges of the coverslips to preserve the slides.l.     Image the slides.8.  Imaging of tissue sections should then be obtained with 20x or 40x microscopic magnification as desired and analyzed using NIS Elements software or ImageJ (open source software).Notes:a.  The filters on the microscope should include the following wavelengths for fluorescent microscopy: i.  FITC (green 470-520 nm) ii.  Cy3/TRITC (red 530-570 nm) iii.  DAPI/nuclei (blue 345-455 nm)b.  Six to eight images per tissue area are recommended in order to capture the variable signal intensity in a wide representative sample of the respective tissue.c.  The negative control slide from step 6 should be used as a background control. With the image analysis software, once the threshold of “background” is calculated use this threshold to image the remaining sections and ultimately normalize them to this threshold to eliminate the background.()Representative dataFigure 2. Representative data taken from Aguilera et al. (2014). 6-week-old KIC mice were treated with saline or mcr84 for 1 week. Animals were sacrificed 1 h after pimonidazole injection (i.v.). Tissue was stained for endothelial cells (MECA32, red) and pimonidazole adducts (Hypoxyprobe, green). Hypoxic area was quantified and is presented on the right. Error bars: ^P<0.05 , one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test. Pancreata from 6 animals were sectioned per treatment group, an average intensity value was determined for each organ and the intensities were averaged and the SEM was calculated. Please view this reference for more information on the model and context of the representative data.()Figure 3. Representative data taken from Aguilera et al. (2014). The amount of hypoxia within tumors was quantified using an antibody, FITC-conjugated mouse anti-pimonidazole, directed against an adduct that forms when Hypoxyprobe-1 enters hypoxic tissue. The percentage of threshold area was quantified and two separate experiments were combined by normalization to data from S p a r c+/+ mice. Images display hypoxia (green) near the vasculature (red) stained with the rat antimouse endothelial cell (Meca-32) antibody within tumors. Nuclei are marked with DAPI (blue).

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3891","title":"Isolation and FACS Analysis on Mononuclear Cells from CNS Tissue","text":"Isolation and FACS Analysis on Mononuclear Cells from CNS Tissue\n\n# Abstract\n\nImmune cells, such as microglia are resident in the brain and spinal cord of normal mice and humans. Furthermore, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and NK cells infiltrate the CNS during certain infections or in neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (a model for multiple sclerosis) or Alzheimer’s disease (Sutton et al., 2009; Browne et al., 2013). Infiltrating cells can be identified using immunohistological staining of sections from brain or spinal cords. However, more detailed phenotypic and functional analysis is possible following isolation of the immune cells from the CNS of normal or diseased mice. Purification of mononuclear cells from brain or spinal cord is dependent on perfusing the mouse to ensure removal of the blood from the CNS tissue, prior to dissociating the tissue and purification of the mononuclear cells on a percoll gradient. The technique provides single cell suspensions with cells of high viability that are suitable for FACS analysis or limited functional studies. The yields are usually low from the normal mouse brain or spinal cord, but higher from mice with EAE or CNS infection. When combined with intracellular cytokine staining and FACS, this technique is particularly useful for analysis of the pathogenic T cells (Th17 and Th1 cells) and their regulation/modulation in EAE.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-3986","title":"Competitive Bone-marrow Transplantations","text":"Competitive Bone-marrow Transplantations\n\n# Abstract\n\nCompetitive bone marrow transplantation assay measures multi-lineage reconstitution of hematopoiesis in irradiated transplant recipient mice. Thus this assay is routinely used to determine haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) functionality in vivo. The principle of the method is to transplant bone marrow donor cells (derived from transgenic mice of choice) on C57BL6 background together with normal competitor bone marrow. In order to distinguish donor from competitor cells upon transplantation, usually competitor mice are congenic and carry the differential B cell antigen originally designated Ly5.1 and CD45.1.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Competition is always with wild-type congenic C57BL6 CD45.1 bone marrow cells. It is crucial to test thecompetition of appropriate wild-type control cells with the competitor and the comparison is always done between the tested donors and their wild-type controls.# A.  One day prior to transplantationIrradiate C57BL6 (CD45.2) host females (5 mice per transplantation group) with 9.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), (Gamma cell 40 Exactor machine). Following exposure to TBI, supplement the drinking water with 1:100 dilution of Ciprofloxacin 200. The antibiotic supplemented water should not be exposed to light.Note: The mice are 8 weeks old, and are irradiated according to the Gamma cell 40 Exactor machine 9.5 Gy or 950 rad. The time is according to the calibration of the machine.B.  Day of the transplantation1.  Sacrifice C57BL6 donor mice (CD45.2) and C57BL6 competitor mice (CD45.1) by C O_2 euthanization or cervical dislocation.2.  Extract the hind limbs using forceps and sharp scissors. Place the bones in PBS on ice. We usually pool bones of 2-3 mice per group, if mice are not to be pooled, separate the individual bones in different wells of a 6 well plate.3.  It is essential to label the wells in the 6 well plate in order to be able to identify donor (CD45.2) and competitor (CD45.1) bones correctly.4.  Flush the total bone marrow cells from bone cavity (both limbs of the mouse) with 5 ml ice cold PBS ( 5 m l in 15~ml tube per mouse) using a 3ml syringe and 21 G×1.5 needle. To dissociate the bone marrow cells, resuspend the 5~ml cell solution using the same syringe.5.  Pass the 5 ml cell suspension trough 70uM nylon strainer to obtain a uniform singlecell suspension.6.  Count the cells (5m l) ) by diluting the cells 1:5-1:10 with Turk’s solution. Count he cells under the inverted light microscope using the Hemacytometer, count all 9 squares. From one mouse typically one will get 50 million cells from both femurs and tibias.7.  Counting the cells is a crucial step; a mistake in cell count can give false results. We usually count every sample in duplicates from three independent dilutions with Turk’s solution. (If 1:10 dilution gives a very low count, less than 40 cells, lower the dilution factor. The most accurate count should give between 50-200 cells.).8.  The cell count in each sample per ml is the number of cells:  cells counted x dilution factor ×10^4 .9.  Competitive BM transplantation is usually achieved by transplanting 1:1 ration of donor  versus  competitor  bone  marrow  cell.  If  desired,  one  can  change  the transplantation ratio.10. Transplanting 1:1 ratio: total of 5 million cells are transplanted to each host; for controls, donor and competitor cells are transplanted separately. (5 host mice per control group).11. Prepare cell mixtures in PBS of donor and competitor cells according to the table:()12. Load 0.2ml into 0.5ml syringes. It may be prudent to prepare extra syringes for each group. Having one extra can help as tail vein injections can be tricky.13. Inject 0.2ml of the cell mixture into each recipient animal tail vein (5 for each group). For the tail vein injection, the mice are heated slightly using an infra-red lamp, restrained and the cells injected into the tail vein of the mice.14. Recipient mice should be congenic wild-type C57BL6 mice (CD45.2).15. As mentioned, these animals need to be irradiated with 9.5 Gy of irradiation ^24~h~ prior to injection.16. Following injection, the recipient mice are left to rest for 4-6 weeks. Water should be changed to normal after a week.# Part II: Blood reconstitution analysisFirst analysis of total blood donor reconstitution is evaluated between 4-6 weeks following bone marrow transplantation. We usually start at 6 weeks and monitor reconstitution, once every two weeks up to 20 weeks.A.  Obtaining total white blood cells for flow cytometry1.  Heat the mice with a red lamp (be careful not to over-heat the mice).2.  Place mouse in a strainer.3.  With a sharp scalpel knife, nick the tail vein and collect up to 200~ul blood into properly labeled eppendorf tube (do not extract more than around 200ul of blood per mouse).4.  Make sure to add 30~ul of 10,000 cup/ ml Heparin solution to each eppendorf tube before collecting blood. This will prevent coagulation of the blood.5.  Keep doing the same for all the recipient mice of the experiment.6.  Carefully add 200~ul PBS to every blood sample, if the eppendorf tube is dirty, change it.7.  Carefully pipette (very slowly) 400~ul ficoll to the bottom of each tube. Two phases should form; ficoll phase at the bottom and blood phase at the top.8.  Centrifuge the tubes at 4,000× g for 6 min at room temperature.9.  Carefully remove the tubes from the centrifuge; the bone marrow mono-nuclear cells will form a fine white ring between the two phases, around 200ul volume.10. Carefully collect the ring of cells with 200ul pipette tip into a new FACS micro-tube.11. Divide each sample to two FACS micro-tubes, if additional cell staining is desired (optional).12. Make sure to carefully label the FACS micro-tubes, to properly identify the samples.13. Wash the cells once with cold FACS buffer: add 1 ml FACS buffer to each tube.14. Centrifuge the cells, 200xg_: 5 min at 4^°C .15. Carefully aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum, the cell pellet will most likely not be visible therefore, aspirate the supernatant leaving enough liquid at the bottom, do not aspirate all the liquid# B.  Labeling cells for flow cytometry1.  Dilute Biotin anti-mouse CD45.1 antibody in FACS buffer (1:100); calculate volume for the number of samples needed, usually prepare excess volume (for example: For 20 samples, make 25× solution - 500ul FACS buffer and 5ul antibody).2.  Resuspend the cells in 20~ul of Antibody solution prepared; add the antibody directly to the cells. Do not add to tube wall.3.  Vortex carefully every tube to resuspend the cells.4.  Incubate on ice for 10m i n .5.  Add 1~ml FACS Buffer to each tube.6.  Centrifuge the cells, 200xg , 5 min at 4^°C .7.  Carefully aspirate the supernatant.8.  Flow cytometry staining can be done as follows table.9.  Make a stock solution with FACS Buffer for each staining according to the number of samples.10. Re-suspend each sample directly with 20ul antibody solution.11. Vortex carefully each tube.12. Protect from light.()13. Incubate on ice for 10m i n . 14. Add 1 ml FACS Buffer to each tube. 15. Centrifuge the cells, 200xg_: , 5 minutes at 4^°C . 16. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.C. Flow cytometry1.  On the BD LSR II software, select for a 'New Experiment' to set up.2.  Select for Area, Height, Width for FSC and SSC; select for Log and Area for the colors FITC, PE, APC, PerCP.3.  Create compensation controls and adjust the gating for unstained blood cells (adjust FSC and SSC voltages as necessary).4.  Adjust each color of single stains in the voltage panel so that the positive peak is at the 10^4 mark.5.  For single stains, use anti-CD45.1 for PerCP, anti-B220 for APC, anti-CD3 for PE and Anti-Gr-1 for FITC.6.  Record the desired voltages after any adjustments for each of the single stains and then calculate compensation controls.7.  Events are now ready to be recorded-set up to collect 5,000-10,000 event.# Part III:  Long-term bone marrow engraftment analysis1.  Sacrifice the chimeras 20 weeks post transplantation by C O_2 euthanization or cervical dislocation.2.  Extract the hind limbs using forceps and sharp scissors. Place the bones in PBS on ice. Separate the individual bones in different wells of a 6 well plate.3.  It is essential to label the wells in the 6 well plates in order to be able to identify bones correctly.4.  Flush the total bone marrow cells from bone cavity with 5ml ice cold PBS ( 15ml tube persample) using a 3ml syringe and  G×1.5 needle. To dissociate the bone marrowcells, resuspend the 5ml cell solution using the same syringe.5.  Centrifuge the cells 200× g_: , 5 min at room temperature.6.  Re-suspend the pellet in 1~ml RBC lysis buffer.7.  Incubate the cells 1.5 min on ice.8.  Add 10ml PBS to each tube.9.  Centrifuge the cells 200xg, , 5 min at room temperature.10. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 5ml PBS.11. Pass the 5~ml cell suspension trough 50~uM nylon strainer to obtain a uniform single-cellsuspension.12. Transfer 1~ml of each sample to FACS tubes.13. Make sure to carefully label the FACS tubes, to properly identify the samples.14. Centrifuge the cells, 200× g_: 5 min at 4^°C .15.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-4097","title":"Monoclonal Antibody Purification (Nicotiana benthamiana Plants)","text":"Monoclonal Antibody Purification (Nicotiana benthamiana Plants)\n\n# Abstract\n\nPlant-based expression systems provide an alternative biomanufacturing platform for recombinant proteins (Matoba et al., 2011). In particular, plant virus-based vectors can overexpress  proteins  within  days  in  the  leaf  tissue  of  Nicotiana  benthamiana  (N. benthamiana). To overcome the issues of genetic instability and  limited  infectivity  of recombinant viruses, Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of “deconstructed” virus vectors has become the mainstay for the production of large and/or multicomponent proteins, such as immunoglobulin (Ig)G monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we describe a method of producing human IgG mAbs in N. benthamiana using the tobamoviral replicon vector magnICON®. The vector can express up to a few hundred mg of a mAb per kg of leaf material in 7 days. A representative case for the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV and anti-influenza mAbs, VRC01 and CR6261 respectively, is shown (Hamorsky et al., 2013). Leaf tissue is homogenized and the extract is clarified by filtration and centrifugation. The mAb is purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using Protein A affinity and Phenyl HP hydrophobic interection resins.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Transform electrocompetent agrobacteria cells with plant-expressing viral vector DNA plasmid containing the sequence for the mAb of interest at 2,000 V for 5 msec.2.  After shaking transformed cells for 1 h at ^28~^°C to establish antibiotic resistance, streak cells on LB agar plates (containing 30 u/m l Rifampicin, 50 u/ml Gentamicin and 50u/m l Kanamycin) and grow in ^28^°C incubator for 3 - 4 days.3.  Pick a single transformed bacterial colony and grow in 5~m of YenB media plus 30 mu g/m Rifampicin and 50~u/ml Kanamycin at ^28^°C and 225 rpm overnight.4.  Transfer 5ml starter culture to large flask containing 95ml fresh YenB media plus the same antibiotics and grow at 28~^°C and 225 rpm overnight.5.  Measure the optical density at 600 nM using UV/Vis Spectrophotometer using YenB media as a blank. Calculate the volume of the large culture required for a final OD600 equal to 0.03 in the total volume of infiltration buffer needed (1.6 L).6.  Centrifuge calculated volume of bacterial culture at 5,000 x g , room temperature for15-30 min. Re-suspend the pelleted bacteria in any volume of infiltration buffer and dilute to final volume of 1.6L . Note: For example, if measure O D_600 is 1.25 then the following calculation would be made (1.25) x=(O.O3)(1.6L) x=38.4 m I of bacterial culture would need to centrifuged then re-suspended in infiltration buffer.7.  Transfer the re-suspended bacteria to vacuum apparatus and fill to final volume.Apply 25 inches Hg of pressure to all the leaves of an entire N. benthamiana plant (between 26-30 days old) for 2 min then release the vacuum causing the bacterial inoculum to enter the leaves (Figure 1).  The same infiltration buffer can be re-used for up to approximately 16 plants without any noticeable depreciation in inoculation. Note: Efforts should be made to keep plant soil from entering infiltration buffer but it will not interfere with successfully infecting plants.()Figure 1. Vacuum Infiltration. The mAb vector is delivered via A. tumefaciens into N. benthamiana leaves using vacuum infiltration (see above, procedure step 7).8.  Plants are grown post-infiltration the same as before infiltration, at ^27 ^°C and >50% humidity following a 16 h daytime/8 h nighttime schedule.  Water the plants every other day.9.  At 7 days post infiltration (dpi), harvest the infected leaves expressing mAb by cutting the leaves at the base of the stem and measure the total mass. Inoculated leaves are distinguishable by the mosaic phenotype displayed after 4-5 days post infiltration compared to non-inoculated leaves.10. mAb is extracted in cold extraction buffer by using an industrial blender while mixing 2 ml buffer for every 1 g leaf tissue. Note: For the remaining duration of the procedure, all efforts are made to ensure the mAb remains at _4° C including extraction and purification.11. The leaf extract is centrifuged at 15,000× g for 10m i n at 4^°C to pellet plant debris.12. The partially clarified extract is pH adjusted to 7.0 using sodium hydroxide and centrifuged at 15,000× g for 10m i n at 4^°C to pellet starches and small plant debris.13. The final step of extraction requires the clarified extract to be passed through a 0.2 µm bottle top filter using a vacuum.14. mAb is purified initially by using a HiTrap Protein A HP column from GE Healthcare via FPLC on an AKTA purifier. The column is equilibrated with 10 column volume (CV) of Protein A Equilibration/Wash buffer.15. mAb clarified extract is loaded at 2 ml/min. After the extract has been loaded to the column,  unbound  proteins  are  washed  out  of  the  column  using  Protein  A Equilibration/Wash buffer (10C V) .16. Protein A Elution buffer is used to elute mAb from the Protein A column using a step gradient to 100% Protein A Elution buffer for 10 CV. The pH is adjusted from 3.0 to 7.0 using 1 M Tris buffer (p H8.0) for the fractions containing mAb. Note: A step gradient is programmed into the method run so that the AKTA purifier transitions from O% elution buffer to 100% elution buffer in a single step.17. Following Protein A purification, a HiTrap Phenyl HP column from GE Healthcare is utilized. The column is equilibrated with 10 CV in Phenyl HP Equilibration/Wash buffer.18. Protein A eluted mAb is diluted 1:10 in Phenyl HP Equilibration/Wash buffer and loaded at 2m l/m i n .  Unbound protein is washed off of the column using 10 CV Phenyl HP Equilibration/Wash buffer.19. Phenyl HP Elution buffer is used to elute mAb from the column using a linear gradient from 0% Phenyl HP Elution buffer to 100% Phenyl HP Elution buffer over 30 CV followed by an additional 5 CV at 100% Phenyl HP Elution buffer. Note: A linear gradient is programmed into the method run so that the AKTA purifier controls the incremental transition from O% elution buffer to 100% elution buffer for which the entire length of elution is 30 V.20. Purified mAb is formulated into Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) pH 7.2. Purity is analyzed by densitometry of an overloaded Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing and non-reducing conditions.21. Activity is determined by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance and in vitro virus neutralization assays.# Recipes1.

{"doc_id":"Bio-protocol-4119","title":"Autophagy Assays (LC3B immunofluorescence, LC3B western blot, acridine orange assay)","text":"Autophagy Assays (LC3B immunofluorescence, LC3B western blot, acridine orange assay)\n\n# Abstract\n\nAutophagy is a dynamic cellular event that is involved in the degradation of long lived proteins and organelles in cells. Biochemical methods such as western blot to measure autophagic proteins have been increasingly used in autophagy studies because it is convenient and objective. Among them, the total amount of Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), the mammalian homologue of the autophagy-related Atg8 in yeast, is a very useful and most commonly used tool in autophagy studies. Other methods such as electron microscopy and immunofluorescence are also available to measure autophagy. The following protocol describes three  simple  and  commonly  used  protocols  for  measuring  autophagy  in  cells:  LC3B immunofluorescence, western blot and acridine orange assay. Although these three methods are frequently used to provide basic information about autophagy, people should keep in mind that they are not enough to give the exact details about the autophagy flux due to the complexity of this dynamic process. In addition, acridine orange assay is only a supplementary method to detect autophagy because it also has high affinity to other organelles such as lysosomes. For further investigation about a compound’s effect on autophagy flux, additional and more complicated assays are recommended. Protocols here provide a starting point for people to get a snapshot of whether a compound can affect autophagy in tissue culture cells.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1. 70% ethanol\n2.

Place one round coverslip per well in 24-well plate and add around 0.5:ml:70% ethanol for 1 min to sterilize the coverslip. Aspirate ethanol and let it dry for 5-10 m i n . Tissue cultured cells were plated on 24-well plate one day before experiment to let them attach to coverslips. (For cells to be plated on the coverslips, it depends on the time of drug treatment for your experiment so that the final cell confluency will be optimal for observation (80-90% )2.  On the day of experiment, treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired time.3.  Fix the cell by replace with 0.5ml cold 100% methanol (prestored in -20 ^°C_. ) and fix for 5 min. Since the cold methonal is prestored in -20~^°C and the fixation time is short, this step can be performed at RT on the bench. Cells can also be fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20-30 min followed by permeabilization with TBS-Tx for 20 min.4.  Wash coverslips with 0.5m PBS once and replace with 0.5m AbDil-Tx to block. The block step can range from room temperature 30 min to 4~^°C overnight. For example, people can use RT 30m i n , 1 h, 2 h or 4°0°2 h to overnight.5.  Prepare primary antibody. LC3B antibody from cell signaling can be diluted at 1/200-1/500 in AbDil-Tx. Usually one coverslip need 30-100~ul .6.  Transfer coverslips to the humid chamber. It can be made from a 15 cm round tissue culture plate. Cut a piece of square or rectangle parafilm that can fit the bottom of the plate. Use finger and tweezer to press down to make the parafilm adhere tightly to the bottom of the plate. The coverslips can then sit on the parafilm with liquid on top. Use a sheet of foil that can cover the lid of the plate to protect the coverslips from light. Incubating coverslips in this humid chamber will protect the coverslips from light in all steps. Use wet kimwipes to keep the humid chamber humid to prevent antibody evaporation.7.  Add diluted LC3B antibody onto the coverslips. Incubate at room temperature for -4 or at 4~^°C overnight. If incubate overnight, make sure to add at least 50~ul to each coverslip and wet the kimwipes in the humid chamber in case of antibody evaporation.8.  While  incubating,  prepare  secondary  antibodies  by  diluting  fluorescently  labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody into AdDil-Tx.9.  After incubation, wash LC3B antibody away by holding a transfer pipette filled with TBS-Txin one hand and a pipe that is attached to a liquid bottle and a vacuum pump to remove washing solution. Let TBS-Tx flow through the coverslips to wash the antibody away. Each coverslip needs to be washed 3 times with around ^2m of TBS-Tx each time.10. Add diluted secondary antibody onto coverslips and incubate at room temperature for around 1-2 h. After incubation, wash the coverslips in the same way as above.11. Take the mounting medium, ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI out of freezer around 10 minutes before the end of incubation to let it warm up to room temperature. Squeeze out a small drop (around 2-3ul ) of mounting medium onto the slide.12. Suck off the liquid on the coverslips as complete as possible and mound the coverslips onto the slide, on the top of ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium. Remember to keep the cell side down and keep them with direct contact with mounting medium.13. The ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI mounting medium usually needs overnight to solidify and this step needs to be done at room temperature. Leave slides in a drawer or other space protected from light overnight to let it dry.14. When the slides are ready, take it to a fluorescent microscope to observe and take pictures (Figure 1).()Figure 1. LC3B immunofluorescence shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells. Hela cells were treated with indicated concentrations of Torin2 for 3 days stained antibody specific for LC3B and DAPI.# B. LC3B western blot1.  Tissue-culture cells are plated on 12-well plate (or 6-well plate) one day before experiment to let the cells attach to coverslips.2.  On the day of experiment, 10 u/ml of E64d/pepstatin A were added to cells one hour before to increase autophagy turnover. Different concentrations of small molecule compounds were then added to cells.3.  After desired time of incubation, wash cells once with PBS. Then lyse cells in lysis buffer by directly overlay 100-200ul lysis buffer (M-PER with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor) on the cells and incubate on ice (or 4^°C_. ) for 10-20 min .4.  At the end of incubation, collect cell lysate in a 1.5ml tube and spin 1 minute at max speed and 4^°C to remove cell debris.5.  Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, normalize, and add sample buffer. For drugs treated for a couple of hours, it’s usually not needed to normalize them since they normally don’t affect the cell numbers. However, for longer treatment (longer than a few hours), people should normalize the protein concentration across samples. Boil and load on a SDS-PAGE. Either a 15% SDS-PAGE or a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel id good for separating LC3B bands.6.  Transfer gel into a PVDF membrane as the standard western blot protocol.7.  Block the PVDF membrane in TBS-Tween (“TBS-T”) with 5% Non-fat dry milk for 1h at room temperature on a shaker.8.  Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare LC3B antibody by diluting it at 1/1small,000 into AbDil-Tw.9.  Incubate membrane in diluted LC3B at room temperature for ^2-3h or at 4^°C overnight.10. Wash with TBS-T for 5 min, 3 times. Prepare HRP-conjugated secondary antibody by diluting it at 1/1,000 into AbDil-Tw.11. Incubate membrane in diluted secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour.12. Wash with TBS-T for 5 minutes, 3 times.13. Gently use paper towel to dry the membrane and place it face up and flat on a sheet of plastic wrap.14. Use prepared ECL to detect protein. Drain ECL and gently use paper towel and kimwipes to dry the membrane.15. Wrap up the membrane with plastic wrap.16. Either expose it to an X-ray film or use an imaging machine (Figure 2).()Figure 2. Western blot of LC3 shows that Torin2 induces apoptosis and autophagy in cells. Indicated cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of AZD8055 or Torin2 for 3 days before the cells and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-LC3B and anti-tubulin antibodies.C.  Acridine orange assay1.  Tissue cultured cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plate one day before as introduced in LC3B immunofluorescence.2.  One the day of experiment, cells are treated with different concentrations of small molecule compounds for desired amount of time before 1 u/ m I acridine orange was added for 15 min.3.  Cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in P B S+4% formaldehyde, washed with TBS-Tx before they are mounted in Prolong Gold with DAPI, which is the same as step A11 and A12.4.  Pictures were taken by a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3, left panel).5.  Total fluorescence of acridine orange in each frame was quantified using MetaMorph and divided by the total number of cells within the frame. Numbers are then normalized to DMSO-treated cells to show the acridine orange fold changes (Figure 3, right panel).()Figure 3. Acridine orange assay shows that Torin2 induces autophagy in cells. Hela cells were treated with different concent rations of Torin2 for 3 days and then stained for acridine orange and DAPI.# Recipes1. TBS 50 mM Tris-Cl 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5)2.

HSV1, and its mutant (H S Var1-s r39T K) with improved substrate specificity, were used as reporter genes for PET-imaging of various biological functions in small animals, by combining with radiolabeled substrates such as ^18F. -FHBG and ^124l. - FIAU. ^3 H -Penciclovir (PCV) uptake assay is a method of choice used to determine the expression level of HSV1-TK in mammalian cells and tissues. HSV1-TK phosphorylate PCV and result in the formation of penciclovir monophosphate, and its subsequent phopsphorylation by cellular TK lead to the formation of penciclovir triphosphate, which is trapped selectively in cells expressing HSVTK. ^3H -Penciclovir enables the detection of penciclovir uptake of mammalian cells and tissues by radioactive procedures such as scintillation counting. Here we describe the protocol to carry out ^3 H -Penciclovir uptakes in mammalian cells.\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.  Control and experimental cells (HEK293T and HEK293T-sr39TK)\n2.

Mammalian HEK293T and HEK293T cells stably expressing sr39-HSV1-TK (HEK293Tsr39TK) should be plated at a confluency of 60-80% in 12 well culture plates (150,000 cells/well in 1ml DMEM). Incubate at 37^°C with 5% C O_2 for ^24h .2.  Twenty-four hours after initial plating remove the medium and add 0.5~ul of ^3H. - Penciclovir/well overset0.5m C i/m I of 8- ^3H -Penciclovir; specific activity 14.9 ci mmol-1) in 0.5ml of respective culture medium.3.  Incubate at 37^°C for 3h . Maintain the incubation time consistent between samples.4.  Keep the same cells (HEK293T) plated in equal number express no HSV1-TK as control.5.  After 3 hours of incubation remove the medium carefully without disturbing cells, and wash the plates twice with 0.5 ml each of ice cold PBS. Pool the medium and wash solutions from respective well to measure the remaining total activities.6.  Add 0.5m of 0.1 N NaOH to each well and leave it for 10 min at room temperature in a shaker to lyse the cells.7.  Transfer 20~ul of homogenous cell lysate to measure total protein concentration by using Bradford protein assay reagent. In brief, to each 20ul of cell lysate add 1m of 1× Bradford protein assay reagent and read the absorbance at 595 nm (A595) 5 min after incubation at room temperature in a spectrophotometer. Use standard graph prepared with the standards (BSA) diluted in 0.1 N NaOH to calculate the total protein present in 0.5 m of cell lysate.8.  Transfer the remaining cell lysate (480~ul) to scintillation vial and 5~m of biodegradable scintillation fluid (Cytoscint fluid). Cells lacking HSV1-TK expression exposed to ^3H. - Penciclovir serve as negative control.9.  The total remaining activity from each sample should be measured by using 480~ul of solution taken from the pooled medium and the wash solution, and also measured from 0.5 µl of ^3H -Penciclovir diluted in 480ul of medium.10. Measure the radioactivity from different samples in a Scintillation counter by taking an average reading/min by reading for 5 min. Normalize the results with protein concentration and relate with total activity.11. Results should be expressed as the percentage conversion of ^3 H -PCV per milligram of protein/total count, or as the conversion of ^3 H -PCV in moles per milligram of protein/total activity (Radioactivity within cells/Radioactivity remained in medium ^+ Radioactivity within cells).\n\n# Outline\n\n## Cell Plating\nPlate Mammalian HEK293T and HEK293T cells stably expressing sr39-HSV1-TK (HEK293Tsr39TK) at a confluency of 60-80% in 12 well culture plates (150,000 cells/well in 1ml DMEM).\nIncubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24h.\n## Penciclovir Addition\nRemove the medium and add 0.5~ul of 3H-Penciclovir/well (specific activity 14.9 ci mmol-1) in 0.5ml of respective culture medium.\nIncubate at 37°C for 3h.

The fixative FAA (formaldehyde, acetic acid and ethanol) is suitable for preservation of nuclear morphology and allows for quantitative staining of DNA with Schiff reagent in Feulgen staining. The fixation and embedding protocol may be used also for various other histology staining procedures, but care must be taken as the cytoplasm usually shrinks a bit using this procedure. The protocol was used for analysis of seed development of various maize lines, mutants and maize relatives (Vilhar et al., 2002; Kladnik et al., 2006; Dermastia et al., 2009; Bernardi et al., 2012).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.

Aliquot FAA fixative in glass vials ( 20 mI vials, 10 ml fixative). Keep vials on ice, fixative should be cold when you put tissue in. Cut tissue with a scalpel or razor blade into pieces, that have at least one dimension smaller than 2 or 3m m , and immediately immerse in cold fixative.Note: When cutting the tissue take into consideration the type of sections you wish to obtain.2.  Place open vials with fixed material in the vacuum desiccator and expose them to moderate vacuum for 15 min to pull the air out of the tissue. If the tissue doesn’t sink when you release vacuum, apply and release the vacuum one more time. After vacuuming, replace fixative in vials with fresh fixative.3.  Fix overnight at 4^°C (refrigerator).# B.  Dehydration in a series of TBA1.  Keep pure TBA (1 L) in a warm place before use (e.g. on the top of an incubation oven), it freezes below 25~^°C . Prepare dehydration solutions and store solutions a – e on room temperature (RT) and f – h on the incubating oven.2.  Dehydrate tissue in each step for an hour to one day, depending on tissue size (6 DAP maize kernels for half a day, 12 DAP maize kernels for one day each step). Steps with dehydration solution a – e should be on RT, steps f – h in the incubation oven at 56-60~^°C . Use a plastic Pasteur pipette to pull the old solution from the vial, then replace with equal amount of next solution (you need a relatively much larger volume of dehydrating solution compared to your sample). Mark dehydration progress on the label on vial. Alternatively, you can pour the old solution out of the vial and replace with a new one (you don’t need to completely drain the vial). Work in a fume hood. In the last change of TBA, fill the vial only to the half of the vial volume, so that you will leave enough room for the adding of the Paraplast Plus in the next step.# C.  Embedding in paraffin (Paraplast Plus)1.  Keep molten Paraplast Plus and plastic pipettes in the incubation oven at 56-60~^°C . You need a large stock of molten paraffin, because it takes a long time to melt (e.g. two rectangular histology staining dishes holding 300ml ).2.  Add pellets of Paraplast Plus wax in vials half filled with TBA. Alternatively, you can add equal volume of molten wax to the TBA in the vials. Paraplast Plus has a fine structure and additives (DMSO), which help in better penetration into the tissue, which is very important for trouble-free sectioning. Keep in 56-60~^°C oven, with the vial cap attached and mix a few times, when the wax is completely melted. Leave in the oven overnight.3.  The next day, pour or pipette away the TBA/wax mixture in a waste container in a fume hood (you can make a small waste container out of aluminum foil). Add fresh molten wax,and leave in oven overnight with vials open, so that all the TBA evaporates. The next day change the wax with fresh one several times (use a warm transfer pipette or pour away), for example twice a day for two days.D.  Casting wax blocks1.  Set air condition in the lab on warmer (if it is too cold, the wax will solidify too quickly).2.  Equipment: a.  Hot plate (set on low – around 68^°C_. ), with aluminum foil tent to keep the heat inside b.  Metal forceps (use dedicated forceps for wax work, they are difficult to clean) c.  Alcohol burner d.  Plastic or metal molds e.  Embedding rings or embedding cassete bases f.   A small beaker with molten Paraplast Plus (also has to be dedicated for wax work) g.  A tray with a thin layer of cold water (cool it by adding ice) h.  An ice buckets filled with ice i.   Flat ice packet (frozen cooling pack) or brass plate (optional)3.  Keep a small amount of molten wax in a beaker in the aluminium foil tent in the hot plate. We also protect the hot plate with a layer of aluminium foil to keep it clean from wax. If the plate is not precisely thermo-regulated check the plate temperature all the time – if it gets too hot to touch, you have to turn it off and then turn it on when the wax starts to solidify. Prolonged temperatures over 62^°C will damage Paraplast Plus. Also, if using metal molds, keep them on a hot plate before using them.4.  Take one vial with samples out of the oven at a time, and place it on the hot plate. Label the same number of embedding rings as the number of samples with a pencil or waterproof marker. Pour some wax in the mold, take one sample out of the vial with forceps warmed in a flame of alcohol burner. Note: Be careful, just pass forceps through the flame for a short time, if smoke is coming off the forceps, they are too hot. Orient the sample in the mold on the hotplate considering the type of sections you wish to obtain later. Carefully transfer the mold on the brass-plate/ice-packet or just on the table, so that the bottom layer of wax solidifies and fixes the sample in place. If the sample is difficult to position on the hot plate, you can position it now, when the bottom layer of wax is solid. Fill the mold with molten wax to the edge, and cover with the labeled embedding ring. Then transfer the mold into the tray with cold water and ice and leave it there for about 10 min so that wax solidifies completely. Then put the mold on the ice, wait for a few minutes and then remove the wax block from the mold (the cooling with ice helps the block getting loose from the mold). Put the mold back on a hotplate to re-use it. We usuallyprocess 5 to 10 blocks at a time. Store the blocks in the refrigerator at 4^°C (see Figure 1).()Figure 1. Schematic drawing of workplace organization for embedding tissue samples in paraffinE.  SectioningEquipment:a.  Rotary microtomeb.  Disposable microtome bladesc. A small brushd. A forceps with sharp endse. A single-edged razorbladef. Dark cardboard plate (for putting the sections on and observing them)g. A stereomicroscope (optional but recommended)h. Hot plate set on 40^°Ci. A small jar with distilled waterj. A plastic pipettek. Cleaned objective microscope slides, frosted on one edgel. A pencil2.  Trim the wax block around the sample with a single-edged razor blade so that the upper and lower edges are parallel, and the left and right edges are at an angle, so that the lower edge of the block is longer than the upper. Also the sides of the block should not be vertical but inclined – always cut the block with the razor blade away from the sample in clean cuts from the top to the bottom of the block (see Figure 2).()Figure 2. Sectioning paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Top: Directions of trimming the paraffin around the sample. Bottom: sectioning on the microtome and arranging the sections on a slide.3.  Fix the embedding ring with the sample in the sample holder on the microtome. Set the thickness of sections (usually 10 to 20um ) and the cutting angle (around 7 degrees). Start sectioning; the first few sections won’t be good, so remove them with a small brush, always away from the blade, not towards it When the surface of the sample evens, the ribbon will start forming. Cut enough sections to fit them on a dark cardboard, and cut the ribbon with a razor blade. Cut several ribbons, until you are sure that you have cut the region of interest, and then look at the sections with a stereomicroscope, to locate the interesting sections (e.g. median longitudinal sections of the kernel).4.  Label the objective slides with a pencil, put them on a hot plate (at 40 °C_. ) and apply some water on them (to almost cover them). Cut the ribbon in smaller regions with two or three sections, and apply two sets of sections on each slide (one will be used for the experiment and the other will serve as a control). The water area should be larger than the size of the ribbon, so the sections have room to spread and even out. Optionally you can drain excess water from the slides using filter paper. Leave the sections on the hot plate overnight to dry and attach to the slides. Store them in slide boxes on room temperature or in the refrigerator at 4^°C .F.  Feulgen staining1.  The Feulgen reaction (Feulgen and Rossenbeck, 1924) quantitatively stains DNA. The nuclei become purple, while the rest of the cell is clear. The staining is done in Coplin jars (the volume of staining solution is 40 ml ). Sections on objective slides are dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through an ethanol series to water, hydrolyzed in 5 M HCl for 75m i n at ^20 ^°C , stained with Feulgen reagent for 120min at _20°_C , washed for 45 min in six changes of S O_2 -water, dehydrated in an ethanol series, then mounted in DPX mounting medium.2.

These traits may be based on general mechanisms and signaling pathways common to many different plant species. One such mechanism could be the recruitment of phytohormone pathways by P. . indica. It  is  known,  that  many  mutualistic  microorganisms  are  able  to  synthesize  and  secrete phytohormones during the interaction with their host plants. This protocol has been successfully utilized to analyze tryptophan (TRP)-dependent biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and its indole derivatives by P. indica as well as their influence on the growth of this fungus (Hilbert et al., 2012).\n\n# Materials & Inputs\n\n\n1.
